Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5′ UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38
for replication, they provide genomes with a competitive advantage. However, although 39 replicons and full-length genomes lacking all PKs were replication competent, no infectious 40 virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one PK copy. This is consistent with our 41 earlier report describing the presence of putative packaging signals in the PK region. 42 43 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The P2 64 and P3 regions encode the non-structural proteins 2B and 2C and 3A, 3B (1-3) (VPg), 3C pro and 4 structural protein-coding region is replaced by reporter genes, allow the study of genome 68 replication without the requirement for high containment (9, 10) ( figure 1A ).
The FMDV 5′ UTR is the largest known picornavirus UTR, comprising approximately 1300 71 nucleotides and containing several highly structured regions. The first 360 nucleotides at the 5′ 72 end are predicted to fold into a single large stem loop termed the S-fragment, followed by a The PKs were originally predicted in 1987 and consist of two to four tandem repeats of a ~48 86 nucleotide region containing a small stem loop and downstream interaction site (figure 1B) 87 (12). Due to the sequence similarity between the PKs (figure 1C), it is speculated that they 88 were formed by duplication events during viral replication, probably involving recombination. 89 Between two and four PKs are present in different virus isolates but no strain has been 90 identified with less than two PKs, emphasising their potential importance in the viral life cycle 91 (19, 20) . The presence of PKs has been reported in the 5′ UTR of other picornaviruses such as 92 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Although replicons and full-length genomes lacking PKs were 106 replication-competent, no infectious virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one 107 PK copy. This is consistent with our earlier report describing the presence of putative 108 packaging signals in the PK region (22). 109 110 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Plasmid construction. 117 The FMDV replicon plasmids, pRep-ptGFP, and the replication-defective polymerase mutant 118 control, 3D-GNN, have already been described (10).
To introduce mutations into the PK region, the pRep-ptGFP replicon plasmid was digested 121 with SpeI and KpnI and the resulting fragment inserted into a sub-cloning vector (pBluescript) 122 to create the pBluescript PK. PKs 3 and 4 were removed by digestion with HindIII and AatII 123 before insertion of a synthetic DNA sequence with PK 3 and 4 deleted. PKs 2, 3 and 4 were 124 deleted by PCR amplification using ΔPK 234 Forward primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse 125 primer, the resultant product was digested with HindIII and AatII and ligated into the 126 pBluescript PK vector. Complete PK deletion was achieved by introduction of an AflII site at 127 the 3′ end of the poly-C tract by PCR mutagenesis to create the sub-cloning vector, pBluescript 128 C11, which was then used to remove all the PKs by PCR mutagenesis using ΔPK 1234 forward 129 primer and FMDV 1331-1311 reverse primer. The modified PK sequences were removed from 130 the sub-cloning vectors and inserted into the pRep-ptGFP plasmid using NheI-HF and KpnI-131 HF.

Mutations were then introduced into the replicon plasmid as described above.
To assess the effects of truncation of the poly-C-tract on replication the entire sequence was 137 removed. This was performed by PCR mutagenesis using primers C0 SpeI, and FMDV 1331- In vitro transcription. 143 In vitro transcription reactions for replicon assays were performed as described previously (28).
Transcription reactions to produce large amounts of RNA for SHAPE analysis were performed 145 with purified linear DNA as described above, and 1 μg of linearised DNA was then used in a 146 HiScribe T7 synthesis kit (NEB), before DNase treatment and purification using a PureLink FastQ files were quality checked using FastQC with poor quality reads filtered using the 225 Sickle algorithm. Host cell reads were removed using FastQ Screen algorithm and FMDV 226 reads assembled de novo into contigs using IDBA-UD (35).

orientation. 351 Since removal of all four PKs resulted in a significant decrease in replication, the minimal 352 requirements to maintain wt levels of replication were investigated. As near wt level of 353 replication was observed when only one PK was present, all further mutagenesis was 354 performed in a C11 replicon plasmid containing only PK 1. In addition, the orientation of PK 1 was reversed by ""flipping"" the nucleotide sequence to 367 potentially facilitate hybridisation of the loop with upstream rather than downstream sequences.
Changing the orientation of the PK reduced replicon replication to a similar level seen in the replication decreased until at passage three there is a 2.5 fold reduction compared to that of 398 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The 5′ UTR of FMDV is unique amongst picornaviruses due to its large size and the presence 454 of multiple RNA elements, some of which still have unknown function. One of these features 455 is a series of repeated PKs varying in number from 2-4, depending on virus strain. In this study, 456 we sequentially deleted or mutated the PKs to help understand their role in the viral life cycle. 457 We also confirmed the predicted PK structures by SHAPE mapping, although there may be Although all viruses isolated to date contain at least two PKs, replicons or viruses containing a 464 single PK were still replication competent. However, replicons with more than a single PK 465 were found to have a competitive advantage over replicons with a single PK when sequentially 466 passaged. Replicons lacking all PKs displayed poor passaging potential even when co-467 transfected with yeast tRNA, reinforcing the observation of a significant impact in replication.
Moreover, viruses recovered from genomes with reduced numbers of PKs were slower growing 469 and produced smaller plaques. In addition, these differences were more pronounced in more PKs is functionally competent as no differences was seen between replicons congaing a single 472 author/funder. All rights reserved.

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).
The presence of at least two PKs in all viral isolates sequenced so far suggests that multiple 480 PKs confer a competitive advantage in replication. Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.

004f0f8bb66cf446678dc13cf2701feec4f36d76,,"The 2019-nCoV epidemic has spread across China and 24 other countries 1-3 as of February 8, 2020 . The mass quarantine measure implemented in the epidemic's epicenter, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on January 23, 2020, has stopped the human migration between Wuhan and other places. However, according to the local authorities, over five million people had already traveled from Wuhan to other parts of China in the weeks leading to January 23, 2020, with the majority (79.96%) to the other cities within Hubei.
Healthcare resources have become a major bottleneck in the response to this public health crisis. The sudden onset of the epidemic and the sheer size of the infection have caused significant shortage in healthcare resources across Hubei Province. So far, there have been over 11,000 non-local healthcare professionals, mobilized by the public health authorities from other parts of China, fighting against the epidemic in Wuhan. However, this is far from adequate for Wuhan given the severity of the epidemic. In addition to Wuhan, other cities in Hubei are in need of urgent external help as well with respect to health resources, as multiple localized outbreaks are taking place. On February 7, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) initiated the ""One City Covered by One Province"" program, explicitly assigning a specific province to aid one city in Hubei. Two critical questions of operational nature remain, which cities, both in Hubei and other provinces, are most vulnerable to localized outbreaks, and how the public health authorities should balance the healthcare resources under stress to best fight the epidemic and minimize the risks? This study is aimed to shed light on these questions by developing a vulnerability analysis framework integrating the human movement and healthcare resource data.
This study makes use of four public datasets: (a) the daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, collected from NHCC 4 ; (b) the list of designated hospitals with the number of reserved beds, retrieved from the websites of the provincial and municipal health commissions; (c) the information of the hospitals designated for 2019-nCoV, retrieved from 99.com.cn, a public hospital database; and (d) the human movement data, provided by the Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com/), a public site offering real-time migration information across mainland China.
Recent studies indicated that the confirmed case data for Hubei Province, in particular, Wuhan, was subject to the under-reporting bias, while the data from places outside of Hubei is more reliable for inferring the actual epidemic size 5 . Following Wu et al. 5 , we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)-based metapopulation model, which has 100 sub-populations representing the 100 cities that have the greatest number of people traveling from Wuhan. Note that we adopted the same epidemiological parameters as Wu et al. 5 . This model was then used to estimate IDi, the number of infected individuals in each city. Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoV outbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the total number of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.
The Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as the healthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as of January 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020, when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23, 2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubation period identified by Wu et al. 5 .
The ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that the cities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because of their significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with a large number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang are medium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particular vulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and its insufficient healthcare resources.
The reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoV epidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important to increase the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some of these cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselves inadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that several medium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to the lack of healthcare resources.

00d16927588fb04d4be0e6b269fc02f0d3c2aa7b,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) causes significant economic losses in the global poultry industry. Control of infectious bronchitis is hindered by the genetic diversity of the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which has led to the emergence of several serotypes that lack complete serologic cross-protection. While serotyping by definition requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. This paper describes a MinION-based AmpSeq method that genetically typed IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. Total RNA was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples.
AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in three of five samples containing two IBV lineages. Additionally, one sample contained three IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected two of the three. Strain identification, including detection of different strains from the same lineage, was also possible with this AmpSeq method. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using MinION-based AmpSeq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of IBV from oral swab samples.
Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, pleomorphic gammacoronavirus with an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense, 26-27.8 Kb, RNA genome that encodes the nonstructural polyprotein,1a and 1b, and several structural proteins: spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). 38,41 In addition, two accessory genes, expressing 3a, 3b and 5a and 5b, respectively, have also been described. 6, 14, 38 The S protein is highly glycosylated and post-translational cleavage leads to two subunits: S1 and S2. 10,48 Besides acting as the viral attachment protein, the S1 protein is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. 7 As with many attachment proteins that are targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies, the S1 subunit is highly diverse with almost 50% of the amino acids differing among IBV serotypes. 2,21,38 Such variation leads to important biological differences between IBV serotypes and the emergence of novel variants. More than 60 serotypes of IBV have been reported, but the most common serotypes of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
Massachusetts. 16 This genetic diversity leads to emergence of new serotypes and a lack of complete cross-serotype protection by vaccines. 29 The correlation of IBV genotypes and serotypes of IBV has been reported 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV is an important step to diagnose IBV in clinical respiratory cases, ensure selection of proper IBV vaccines for use in vaccination programs, and to better understand the epidemiology of this global virus.
One of the recent comprehensive classification schemes for IBV uses S1 gene sequencebased phylogeny of IBV and identified six genotypes (I-VI), 32 sub-genotypic lineages, and a number of inter-lineage recombinants in global strains of IBV. 44 Among the six genotypes, genotype I (G-I) is the most diverse group of viruses, with 27 unique lineages. 44 As such, sequencing of the S1 subunit provides important information regarding the classification of IBV within samples.
The genetic classification of IBV has relied on genotype-specific RT-qPCR assays, serotype-specific S1 RT-qPCR 32,40 and/or pan-IBV S1 RT-PCR assays coupled with Sanger sequencing. 8,31,49 Genotype-specific RT-qPCRs are limited to short fragments, which may miss important changes in the S1 (~1.6 kb) 44 outside the short target. Additionally, since the target is short, the primers lie within the variable regions of the S1 and may require a different assay for each genotype. Lastly, the pan-IBV S1 primers 1, 17, 22, 23, 25, 33 , while only requiring one reaction, have relatively low sensitivity and are typically used only on egg-cultured virus, which adds an additional, time consuming step and many diagnostic labs do not have SPF embryos readily available. Lastly, cloning of PCR products has been used to detect multiple IBV sub-populations in the sample 30 ; however, this is inefficient when potentially dealing with multiple (three or four) All rights reserved.

As such, the development of a pan-IBV sequencing method to rapidly determine the genotype(s) in samples would aid in lineage typing and tracking of IBV genotypes circulating in poultry flocks.
Recently, third generation sequencing technology has been used for detection of viral nucleotides and sequencing ultra-long DNA molecules. 34 The MinION Nanopore sequencer, a new DNA sequencing technology that allows for rapid, in-house, real-time technique detection and differentiation of IBV lineages, may be cost effective and useful in the field. 19 Ampliconbased sequencing has also been used to amplify specific regions of Newcastle disease 3,13 , infectious laryngotracheitis virus 39 Zika 34 , Ebola 35 and avian influenza viruses 46 , by simple RT-PCR and then sequencing on the MinION device. Real-time data analysis, the lack of significant start-up cost investment or maintenance expenses, simultaneous and sequential multiplexing unique to MinION, and the ability to sequence long DNA molecules so that primers are in conserved regions while the product contains the variable region are the features that make this technology highly feasible to be used for disease diagnostics.
Accurate identification of IBV genotypes from samples, including detection of multiple isolates from a single sample, is crucial to respiratory disease diagnosis, selection of appropriate IBV vaccines, and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to create a single, amplicon-based protocol to sequence IBV-S1 gene and develop a sequence analysis workflow to identify IBV isolates from clinical swab samples. This method provides a useful assay for IBV and a model for the development of future amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) based assays.

A universal S1 primer set, 27 tailed with the MinION universal adapter sequence of 22 nucleotides (underlined, Table 2 ) to allow barcoding of amplicons, was used for targeted amplification of the IBV S1 gene for IBV. The PCR reaction mixture (Expand High Fidelity PCR system, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was composed of 10 µl of cDNA, 1 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 1 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× Expand high fidelity buffer, 1 µl of Expand High Fidelity Enzyme Mix, and 1 µl of 10mM dNTPs, to a final volume to 25 µl with 9 µl of nuclease-free water. The following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 minutes, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. See Table 2 for details about all three primer sets used in this study. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) for visual evaluation. Amplified DNA was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) at 1.6:1 (volumetric bead:DNA) and quantified using the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit on a Qubit® Fluorimeter 3.0.
The amplicons obtained from the tailed S1 primer set were then used to prepare MinIONcompatible DNA libraries. Briefly, each of the amplicons were diluted to 0.5 nM and amplified using barcoding primers (1D PCR Barcoding Amplicon Kit, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, [ONT], UK) and LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min; 15 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds, 62 °C for 15 seconds, 65 °C for 80 seconds; and 65 °C for 80 seconds. The barcoded amplicons were bead purified (1:1.4; bead:solution), pooled (Run1; pool of 10 samples, Run2; pool of 5 samples) into a single All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
Centrifuge 24 , Kraken 50 , QIIME 5 and Mothur 37 have been used to identify and profile microbial species; however, the high error rate 20 of Nanopore reads translates to poor classification accuracy for many of these tools. Alternatively, de novo 3,26 or reference-based 18 assembly methods have been used in MinION and other deep sequencing platforms. Using a strategy similar to other unbiased laboratory tests (e.g., standard bacterial cultures), an approach was developed to maximize usage of reads (i.e., reads are not discarded based on pre-set length or abundance requirements, similar to how a single colony may be interpreted as a significant result). This approach uses read-based classification against a database containing an equal number of representative sequences per lineage to detect and classify the reads based on their lineage, before conducting read-based classification to the isolate level by using all available IBV sequences in a separate database. Finally, lineage-clustered isolate-level read assignments are interpreted by a veterinary diagnostician to result in reads available for consensus building.
The use of a final consensus alignment helps to overcome the individual error rate of MinION sequencing. 3 Similarly, the absence of predetermined metrics used in de novo assembly allows for the informed decision as to how many consensus sequences to build, a bioinformatics problem when dealing with clinical cases that can contain more than one isolate (e.g., similar to how there is not a predetermined number of significant bacterial colonies). Confirmatory followup tests (e.g., RT-PCR) may be needed when dealing with low number of reads in clinical samples; however, future testing of this new technology will allow for creating standards for such confirmatory testing.
Taken together, these results suggest the application of MinION-based AmpSeq, specifically for detecting IBV isolates from clinical samples within a few days, compared to several days to weeks and multiple diagnostic assays to culture and detect multiple IBV All rights reserved.

Clinical swab samples (n = 15) were obtained from samples submitted to the Poultry Diagnostic & Research Center, University of Georgia. Detailed information about the samples is provided in Table 1 .
Total RNA was extracted from each of the swab samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer's instructions, aliquoted, and stored at −80 ºC until further use. These samples were previously tested for IBV and GA08 serotype of IBV.
Briefly, a pan IBV RT-qPCR assay 4 was used to detect IBV in general and then IBV strain specific RT-qPCR assay 36 was used to detect GA08 in the samples using the AgPath ID, One step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST following the previously described protocols.
For MinION cDNA synthesis, RNA was extracted from 500 µl of each clinical sample using Trizol-LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), per manufacturer's directions.
A reaction mixture of 8 µl of total RNA, 1 µl of random primers and 1 µl of dNTPs was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, chilled on ice for at least 1 min followed by addition of 10 µl of cDNA synthesis mix including SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacture's instruction. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, then at 50 °C for 50 min for cDNA synthesis. The reaction was terminated at 85 °C for 5 min, and then chilled on ice. To remove residual RNA, the cDNA solution was incubated with RNase H at 37 °C for 20 min. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Sequencing was allowed to continue for 2 hours until 42,940 reads were obtained for Run1 and 156,000 reads were obtained for Run 2 in 6 hours.
First, a lineage-typing database, containing 32 IBV S1 gene sequences (one sequence from each of 32 lineages in the 6 genotypes 44 ) and the chicken genome (GCF_000002315.4_Gallus_gallus-5.0), was constructed (referred to as ""IBV-lineage-typing database"" in this study). A second database was constructed with all the Avian Coronaviruses S1 sequences (n = 7328) available in NCBI (as of: 09-08-2017) and the chicken genome (referred to as ""All-IBV database"" in this study). Prior to database construction, all sequences were dustmasked (NCBI C++ ToolKit), and each isolate was assigned a unique taxonomy ID as a species hierarchically under the genus Gammacoronavirus to allow easy sorting. The local BLAST databases were compiled using default settings. The IBV-lineage-typing database was All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The All-IBV database was used to assign IBV isolates taxonomic ID to each of IBV reads from within IBV lineage read clusters.
The IBV-lineage-typing database, which contains only one sequence per lineage, is required as centrifuge divides the score for any given read by the number of hits that have an equal score.
Since some lineages are overrepresented in GenBank (e.g., Mass strains), this results in the scores of those reads (e.g., Mass reads) being divided by a large number, effectively reducing the score for any single alignment. However, because there is only one read per lineage in the IBVlineage-typing database, it has insufficient diversity to determine if there is more than one strain of the same lineage present in a sample. Thus, the All-IBV database provides the diversity required for that analysis.
A schematic diagram of the workflow of MinION data analysis is presented in Fig. 1 . For Nanopore sequencing data, pre-processing steps were performed to prepare data for downstream analysis. Briefly, Nanopore reads (FAST5) were basecalled using Albacore v 2.02 (https://github.com/Albacore/albacore) with following parameters (read_fast5_basecaller.py -i /Input_reads.fast5 --recursive -t 4 -s /Output_files --flowcell FLO-MIN107 --kit SQK-LSK108o fastq). Porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) was used for adapter trimming, (default setting), barcode-based demultiplexing (default settings), and to trim an additional 21 nucleotides, representing the S1 primer sequences (porechop -i Input_file.fastq --extra_end_trim 21 -b ./output_demultiplexed files.fastq). After barcode and adapter removal, reads were analyzed with a script-based, 2-step data analysis protocol, which includes Centrifuge-kreport as taxonomic read classifier 24 using the sequences in the above mentioned BLAST databases.
Briefly, basecalled reads (FASTQ) from individual barcoded samples were used as an input. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint First, the basecalled reads were aligned to the IBV-lineage-typing database using BLASTn and reads were clustered based on the read sequence alignment to the respective prototype sequence of IBV lineage. These read clusters were used to interpret presence of IBV genotypes and lineages in the samples. For isolate level identification of IBV, the lineage-based read clusters were individually aligned to the All-IBV database, which produced sub-clusters of reads. Each of these read sub-clusters potentially represents a different isolate and was further used for interpretation. Knowing that MinION sequencing has a high sequencing error rate in individual reads, further steps were added in the data analysis algorithm to obtain a more accurate consensus sequence. Therefore, these read sub-clusters were mapped, using Geneious mapper in Geneious software v11.1.3. (Biomatters, Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand), to the IBV-lineagetyping database (a reference FASTA file) to obtain consensus sequences from each sub-cluster.
A minimum threshold for number of reads per consensus sequence was not set as in two samples (sample #4 in Run1 and sample #12 in Run 2), only 1 and 5 IBV reads were obtained, respectively; therefore, consensus sequences were built from all the available IBV reads per subcluster. The consensus sequences were compared to GenBank using BLASTn. To select the ""top hit"" from BLASTn output, sequence search results were ordered by ""sequence identity"" and then sequence alignments were evaluated for ""minimum mismatches"" and ""coverage"" of query or subject sequence. All isolates with the highest query or subject coverage and the fewest mismatches were used as ""top hit"" in the final results.
For Sanger sequencing amplicons synthesis, cDNA from MinION library preparation was amplified using the following primer sets (Table 2) . Firstly, a primer set based on Connecticut sequence NCBI FJ904716.1 was used to amplify Genotype I-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Connecticut All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Secondly, a primer set based on GA98 sequence NCBI AF274439.1 was used to amplify Genotype IV-lineage 1 viruses (e.g., Georgia 1998 and Delaware 072 serotypes). Primer sets were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST. 51 The PCR reaction mixture is composed of 10 µl of cDNA, 0.5 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 0.5 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× buffer, 0.5 µl of enzyme mix, and 0.5 µl of 10mM dNTPs, then made the final volume to 25 µl with nuclease-free water.

Five samples from Run 1 were tested with a pan-IBV RT-qPCR assay 4 , and four of those were positive for IBV. Samples with pathogenic IBV strains (Run 2, n = 5) were tested with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR and all five samples were IBV positive (Table 1) . Next, a GA08 serotype specific primer set (in house validated set of primers used for diagnostics) was used on all samples from Run 1 (including five samples that were previously tested by the pan-IBV PCR) and four of 10 samples were positive. Sample #3 and #4, which were positive with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR assay, were negative with GA08 specific RT-qPCR assay indicating that these samples contained IBV serotypes other than GA08 and required further testing. Sample #5 tested negative with both assays (Table 1) .
A total of 10 clinical swab samples (Run 1) were processed for Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of IBV lineages. Based on the MinION results, primers targeting GIV-L1 and GI-L1 (GA98 and Conn and primer sets, respectively) were created. The PCR products were cloned and multiple (6-24) clones from each sample were submitted for Sanger sequencing and results are summarized in Table 3 . Using GIV-L1 serotype primers showed that 9 out of 10 samples were positive with 1 sample (#5) negative for IBV (which is consistent with the pan-IBV RT-qPCR results for this sample). Consensus sequences from multiple clones obtained by using GIV-L1 primers showed the presence of GA98 (GA/A9dvaccinated) in 7 of 9 IBV-positive samples. DE072 was detected in samples #1 and #9 as the lone GIV-1 isolate but was also detected in three samples (#2, and #10) that also contained GA98 (Table 4 ). By using the GI-L1 primer set, which amplified Conn and Mass type IBVs, 3 of 9 IBV-positive samples were All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. (Table 4 ). Based on the two conventional RT-PCRs and the GA08 RT-qPCR, it was determined that only samples #8 and #9 contained a single IBV isolate, while the other 7 samples were positive for 2-4 types of IBV (Table 3) .
PCR amplicons obtained directly from 10 clinical swab samples with vaccine IBV serotypes were barcoded, pooled together and sequenced on MinION device (Run 1). A total of 38,661 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 42,940).
After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 831 to 4114. A total of 14,845 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 128 reads were discarded due to middle adapters.
The Nanopore reads were queried against IBV-lineage-typing database to determine if the samples contained IBV (Figure 1 ). This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in 8 of 10 samples.
The number of IBV reads per sample (IBV positive sample) ranged from 56-944. The MinIONnegative samples included sample #5, which was consistently negative with RT-qPCR and RT-PCR assays (and thus interpreted as IBV negative), and sample #1, which had the highest Cq values in the pan-IBV RT-qPCR (Table 1) .
Sequencing data was further analyzed to determine if multiple IBV genotypes or lineages could be detected. Lineage-1 and lineage-27 from Genotype I (GI-L1, GI-L27), and lineage-1 from Genotype IV (GIV-L1) were the detected lineages in the samples. Results from individual RT-qPCR assay for GA08 (GI-L27), and RT-PCR assays for GIV-L1and GI-L1 confirmed the presence of multiple IBV genotypes and lineages in 6 of the 9 IBV-positive samples (#1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #7) and AmpSeq results confirmed multiple genotypes and lineages in 4 (#2, #4, #6, #7) of those 6 samples (AmpSeq failed to detect any IBV in #1, and failed to detect GIV-L1 in #3).

The presence of a single lineage was confirmed by PCR-based assays and AmpSeq in three samples (#8, # 9 and #10) ( Table 3) .
It was observed that the single read cluster composed of less than 5 reads (Run1, sample #4, GA98) yielded a poor-quality consensus sequence, consistent with the known individual read error rate of MinION sequencing. High-quality consensus sequences were obtained from the other read clusters (>5 reads per cluster). Each of the obtained consensus sequences were compared to GenBank databases using BLAST, which revealed >99% sequence identity to respective IBV isolates Table 4 ). As described in the Sanger Sequencing section, two samples (#8 and #9) contained only one IBV isolate per the non-MinION assays, and the AmpSeq results were consistent with these findings. Non-MinION assays showed that seven samples contained two or more isolates per sample. Six samples (#1, #3, #4, #6, #7, and #10) contained two isolates per sample (Table 4 ). Of those six samples, AmpSeq detected both isolates in four samples (#4, #6, #7, and #10), one isolate in one sample (#3), and no IBV in one sample (#1; as mentioned above, sample #1 was the sample with the highest Cq value). Of note, sample #10 contained two isolates from the same lineage and AmpSeq was able to identify both isolates within this sample.
Finally, the seventh multi-isolate sample (#2) contained four isolates per the non-MinION results, and the AmpSeq detected two of those four isolates. These data show that a co-infection of multiple IBV lineages existed in the above-mentioned samples but a single RT-qPCR, or Sanger sequencing of a single clone may not have detected these co-infecting IBV lineages and required multiple assays to detect all the IBV types. However, the AmpSeq protocol accurately detected multiple IBV lineages in 4 of 7 samples, with partial detection in two of the remaining three samples (Table 4 ). In samples which had the same IBV type, Blast search of consensus All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

To evaluate the utility of this protocol on clinical swab samples with pathogenic IBV variants, IBV-S1 gene was amplified directly from five clinical tracheal scrapings and the PCR amplicons were used to create MinION libraries. A total of 146,540 reads were successfully basecalled from the entire sequencing run (total reads = 156,000). After demultiplexing, reads per barcode ranged from 4,285 to 41,131. A total of 24,297 reads were not assigned to any of the used barcodes and 8,109 reads were discarded due to middle adapters in the basecalled reads.
Real-time analysis of MinION data, which was obtained within 10 minutes of the sequencing, was sufficient for detection of IBV. However, the sequencing data obtained from entire sequencing run was processed with the same protocol as described above. This AmpSeq protocol detected IBV reads in all of the 5 tested samples using all basecalled reads. The number of IBV reads per sample ranged from 5-4,956. Additionally, the sequencing data analysis showed that the IBV reads belonged to GI-17 lineage and typed the isolate as DMV1639. After MinION sequencing results, these samples were later tested to confirm the presence of IBV variant by MDL_DMV1639 IBV variant specific RT-qPCR assay. All 5 samples were positive for IBV MDL_DMV1639 variant of IBV (Table 5) .

This study describes a sequencing approach for rapid and accurate identification of IBV genotypes/lineages utilizing the MinION Nanopore sequencer. Additionally, a sequence analysis workflow is described here. The workflow analysis is designed to deal with the multiple, highly similar sequences contained within GenBank that are due to numerous sequencing experiments of IBV (especially vaccine viruses). This protocol demonstrates the feasibility of real-time-based sequencing to provide isolate-level resolution of IBV directly from clinical swab samples, including samples that contain multiple isolates.
The proper diagnosis of IBV as the cause of clinical respiratory disease is contingent on virus typing and differentiating live vaccine viruses from field strains. 11 Previously, it was reported that IBV genotypes correlate well with the serotypes of IBV 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of IBV will be useful to diagnose vaccine and variant viruses in clinical samples. The rapid pan-IBV and serotype specific RT-qPCR assays 4,23,36 have been used for serotype identification; however, positive results from RT-qPCR is insufficient to determine the IBV genotype and obtain isolate-level resolution of IBV; thus, sequence analysis of IBV-S1 gene is required. Previously, use of partial S1 gene sequences (450 bp) to type IBV has been described. 29 However, increasing the length of sequenced S1 gene (~1620 bp) results in more data to be used for genotyping as more of the hypervariable region is covered. 17, 27, 45 For example, the AmpSeq protocol was able to differentiate two genetically very similar (99.5% at S1 gene of IBV genome) but serotypically different GIV-L1 isolates, DE072 and GA98, within a single sample. Thus, the detection of highly diverse IBV genotypes, via the S1 subunit, with a single and rapid sequencing protocol is desirable and the ability to detect multiple isolates in a single sample would improve IBV detection in clinical samples.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/634600 doi: bioRxiv preprint Currently, pan-IBV RT-qPCR is used to rapidly detect IBV from clinical samples for screening purposes, 4 but this requires additional serotype-specific RT-qPCRs to genotype positive samples, including samples containing more than one genotype. Additionally, if unidentified IBVs are in the sample, then current detection and characterization may also require egg culture followed by various PCRs. 8 The AmpSeq method described in this report detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive and detected all the mixed isolates in four of seven samples containing two or more isolates. While mixed isolates were not 100% identified (0/2 in #1, 2/4 in #2, and ½ in #3) in three samples with the AmpSeq method, detection of those mixed isolates required several non-AmpSeq assays. Although, there is room for improving this new AmpSeq method, it represents a promising, single-step assay that can be used without egg culture. Thus, it is another tool for the detection of IBV, especially in cases when multiple isolates may be present or when genotyping is especially important.
One area that is problematic for a test such as AmpSeq is to detect all the isolates that may be present. While AmpSeq did detect all isolates in 4 samples, in 3 cases not all of the isolates were detected. A potential explanation to partial detection of multiple IBV genotypes could be the relative abundance of IBV genotypes in these clinical samples. It could also be that amplification of these IBV genotypes by serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays is more efficient due to small targeted fragment size (e.g., 120 bp for PCR and ~1600 bp for AmpSeq) and better primer alignment to the target (e.g., degenerate bases are used in the S1 primers used for AmpSeq). One complicating factor of the current AmpSeq protocol is that the IBV target sequence 27 was not originally designed for high specificity, especially from clinical samples. As such, a high proportion of total reads were non-IBV reads (e.g., often mapping to the chicken genome, data not shown), consistent with the extra bands visible in the original report for these All rights reserved.

Lastly, increasing the total number of reads collected by AmpSeq may improve the ability to detect all genotypes in sample by AmpSeq. It is possible to allow the sequencing to continue longer to obtain more reads per sample. Overall, AmpSeq is a feasible test for IBV characterization, and work is ongoing to improve this new type of assay.
For example, cost and time efficiency of a sequencing protocol can be improved through multiplexing of more samples in a single sequencing run. 3, 47 In this study, samples (Run 1 = 10, Run 2 = 5) were simultaneously multiplexed (i.e., pooled and then sequenced in one run) while maintaining IBV genotyping from data collected. Since the MinION flow cells were not exhausted, and can be washed and re-used, the AmpSeq method also has the potential for sequential multiplexing. This would decrease the need to hold samples for weeks while waiting for the cost-optimal number of samples for simultaneous multiplexing. Alternatively, if detection of all isolates within a given sample is preferred, the sequencing can be run longer to increase sensitivity. The single protocol nature of AmpSeq, the ability to obtain S1 gene sequence results, real-time data analysis, and flexibility of testing design makes MinION-based AmpSeq a viable sequencing protocol for typing of IBV isolates.
The advent of real-time, in-house, third generation sequencing represents a transformative opportunity for diagnostic laboratories, by offering the ability to more fully characterize PCR reactions beyond confirming amplicon size (e.g., routine electrophoresis), Sanger sequencing RT-PCR products, or by confirming a partial sequence through probe hybridization (e.g., probe-based qPCR). However, the interpretation of such large data sets represents a challenge to veterinary diagnosticians. Read-based classification software such as genotypes from single sample. Thus, the MinION-based AmpSeq coupled with the data analysis workflow for identification, differentiation, and accurate prediction of IBV genotypes from clinical swab samples can be used as an adjunct to other established rapid diagnostic assays 9,12 until extensive testing of this protocol is done to improve and validate AmpSeq for IBV diagnostics. Furthermore, AmpSeq-based assays can be, and are being applied to other viral pathogens, 3,37 demonstrating the power and utility of this method in the age of molecular diagnostics.

0139ea4ca580af99b602c6435368e7fdbefacb03,"Nipah Virus (NiV) came into limelight recently due to an outbreak in Kerala, India. NiV causes severe disease and death in people with over 75% case fatality rate. It is a public health concern and has the potential to become a global pandemic. Lack of treatment has forced the containment methods to be restricted to isolation and surveillance. WHO's 'R&D Blueprint list of priority diseases' (2018) indicates that there is an urgent need for accelerated research & development for addressing NiV.
In the quest for druglike NiV inhibitors (NVIs) a thorough literature search followed by systematic data curation was conducted. Rigorous data analysis was done with curated NVIs for prioritizing druglike compounds. For the same, more than 1800 descriptors of NVIs were computed and comparative analysis was performed with the FDA approved small molecules and antivirals. These compounds were further evaluated through PAINS filter to study their toxicity profile. Simultaneously, compounds were also prioritized based on the robustness of the assays through which they were identified.
Our efforts lead to the creation of a well-curated structured knowledgebase of 182 NVIs with 98 small molecule inhibitors. The reported IC50/EC50 values for some of these inhibitors are in the nanomolar range -as low as 0.47 nM. In order to prioritize these inhibitors, we performed several tests and applied filters to identify drug-like non-toxic compounds. Of 98, a few compounds passed DruLito & PAINS filters exhibiting drug-like properties and were also prioritized in an independent screen based only the assay robustness. The NVIs have diverse structural features and offer a wide spectrum of ways in which they can be developed further as druglike molecules.
We report a knowledgebase for furthering the development of NVIs. The platform has a diverse set of 98 NVIs of which a few have been prioritized based on a combined evidence strategy. The platform has the provision to submit new inhibitors as and when reported by the community for further enhancement of NiV inhibitor landscape.","Nipah is an infectious negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the genus henipavirus and family Paramyxoviridae [1] . It is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with a particle size ranging from 40 to 1,900nm [2] . While fruit bats are thought to be the natural reservoirs of the virus, they are also able to spread to humans and some other species [3] . There are two major genetic lineages of the virus which are known to infect humans i.e, NIV Malaysia (NIV M ) and NIV Bangladesh (NIV B ) [2] .
The first outbreak of Nipah virus infection erupted between September 29,1998 , and April 4, 1999, when cases of febrile encephalitis in the suburb of Ipoh, Perak, Southern Peninsular Malaysia were reported to the Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH) [4] . It was traced back to cross-species transmission of the virus from pigs to humans [4, 5] . In 2001 another strain of the virus was reported to cause an outbreak in Meherpur, Bangladesh. Since then outbreaks have been recorded almost annually in the country and surrounding regions such as Siliguri, India [6, 7] . Most of the outbreaks have been observed to have a mortality rate ranging from 50-100% [8] . Although direct contact with the infected bat's contaminants could cause transmission of the virus, direct human-to-human transmission has also been observed in the case of healthcare professionals and relatives of infected patients [9, 10] . More recently, the virus has garnered attention due to the first-ever outbreak in southern India during May of 2018 where 19 cases of NiV were reported in Kozhikode, Kerala. In the subsequent year, 2019, another case was reported in Ernakulam district of the state [11, 12] .
Nipah virus causes cell-to-cell fusion in the host thus forming multinucleated cells called syncytia. This allows the virus to spread despite the absence of viral budding and greatly influences its pathogenicity [13, 14] . The  incubation  period  of  the  virus  ranges  from  5  to  14 days (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/nipah/pdf/factsheet.pdf). Primarily the virus infects the central nervous system but the NIV B strain has been shown to have significant respiratory involvement [2] . High mutation rate, human to human transmission, survival time of up to 4 days under various environmental conditions and lack of treatment makes it a potential bioterrorism agent [15, 16] .
Currently, there is no known treatment for the disease. Broad-spectrum antiviral ribavirin has shown contradictory results with even the most optimistic ones significantly below 50% in causing reduction of the mortality rate [17, 18, 19] . Favipiravir (T-705), a purine analogue antiviral, is reported to provide protection to upto 14 days in the Syrian hamster model challenged with a lethal dose of Nipah virus [20] . More recently, experimental drug remdesivir has demonstrated complete protection to four African green monkeys who received a lethal dose of Nipah virus. Studies are planned to assess the efficacy of the treatment over time [21] . Despite being a lethal pathogen there is not a single drug under clinical trial against this virus. Due to several challenges in discovery and development of NVIs, along with lack of therapeutic intervention and the pathogenic propensity of the virus, Nipah infections are enlisted amongst WHO's list of priority diseases [22] .
As mentioned above, various groups have made efforts over the years to identify Nipah virus inhibitors using a variety of viral assays. Most of them have used syncytia formation or titre reduction assays to identify Nipah virus inhibitors. Some of the earlier studies report nipah inhibitors based on screening of large libraries within BSL-4 settings to identify compounds that inhibited the virus-induced cytopathic effect. Three sulfonamide compounds with low EC50 values are reported [23] from these screens. More recently, Bimolecular Multicellular Complementation assays have been developed which can be used to identify potential anti-nipah inhibitors by qualitatively and quantitatively investigating the formation of a syncytium [24] . Also reported recently is a humanized monoclonal antibody for cross-neutralizing NiV and HeV. Cryo-electron microscopy followed by fusion studies demonstrated that the antibody binds to a prefusion-specific quaternary epitope which is conserved in NiV F and HeV F glycoproteins. The binding prevents membrane fusion and viral entry and clearly indicates the importance of the HNV prefusion F conformation for eliciting a robust immune response [25] .
Despite reports of nipah virus inhibitors, no systematic evaluation of the reported compounds is performed. A few antiviral inhibitor databases and studies exist, namely, The Influenza Research Database (IRD) [26] [27] , The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) [28] , enamine library (https://enamine.net/hit-finding/focused-libraries/view-all/antiviral-library), etc. They contain very limited or no information with the focus on Nipah virus. The ones with focus on Nipah virus inhibitors are either scattered datasets or curated versions with limited or no evaluation of the anti-Nipah compounds as starting points for drug discovery and development of anti-Nipah inhibitor(s) [29] .
Towards this, we developed a combined evidence based strategy to systematically evaluate Nipah virus inhibitors. With this objective, we curated the anti-Nipah compounds using a crowdsourcing model and the data were made publicly available at -http://vinodscaria.rnabiology.org/nipah since the inception of the project (May 2018). Our two pronged strategy comprised of (i) prioritization of NVIs based on the robustness of the assays which were used to identify them and (ii) estimation of several drug likeness parameters for the NVIs. The drug likeness analysis includes diversity analysis, similarity to FDA approved compounds (as drug repurposing candidates) or reported antivirals (to identify new scaffolds), profiling based on PAINS and DruLito filters and comparison to ZINC lead like libraries. The data curated from literature along with all these analyses is made available on a web-based platform which also allows submission and assessment of new molecules reported as NVIs.
PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Google (https://www.google.com/) were the two main sources considered for collecting the inhibitors that showed activity against Nipah virus. Research papers relevant to the study were downloaded using the query as 'Nipah' and those with the keyword in their abstract/title were shortlisted. At the time of curation this keyword listed 838 papers which were considered for data-mining. This step was followed by a scoring system wherein papers that had confirmed information regarding the inhibitors against Nipah virus in their abstracts were assigned a score of '10', those that may or may not have information regarding the same were given a score of '5', those with information on peptides used as inhibitors were assigned a score of '4' and rest with no relevant information were given a score of '0'. Papers with score values of 10, 5 and 4 were considered for further study and all of them were manually curated to create a Nipah Virus Inhibitor Knowledgebase (NVIK) sheet which is used by all the curators to organize data based on a predefined data structure shown below in Table 1 .
Inhibitor Name -as reported in literature Assay type 
In order to ensure data quality, a separate team of curators re-performed the curation independent of the initial team. Errors are marked in 'Red' in the curation sheet and was then marked 'Green' once the data is verified by both the teams. Data curation and quality check was done manually and the data is stored in NVIK-Open resource Sheet which served as the crowdsourcing platform. Each entry was tagged with its contributor's email Id.
The Nipah Virus Inhibitor Knowledgebase (NVIK) is developed using the open source LAMP (Linux-Apache-Mysql-PHP) server technology. We have also used PHP, HTML, JavaScript, AJAX and CSS. The web-interface has provision for text, structure and complex query based search and other options for browsing.
In the NVIK web interface, three search options are available, namely, 'Simple Search', 'Query Builder' and 'Structure Search'. The Simple Search option is to retrieve information using a text-based query on all/selected fields of the database. User can selectively display the searched records. Overall, the database contains -unique fields as shown in Figure 1 . An extensive 'Structure Search' interface is also available in NVIK. The user can query using SMILES, SDF and MOL formats. In addition, the users can also draw a compound in JSME browser that may be searched in NVIK.
Data on NVIs can be browsed for physicochemical properties like molecular weight, XLogP, polar surface area (PSA), hydrogen bond donor (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and the number of rotatable bonds (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/anshu/nipah/physico_chem.php). The database can also be browsed from major fields as shown in Figure 1 . 
We have customized a CIRCOS [31] (http://circos.ca/) in one of our earlier studies on phytomolecules in mycobacteria [32] . We utilized a similar approach to represent the relationship among physicochemical properties of NVIs. In customized CIRCOS, 98 inhibitors are defined with a band having a width of 1000. This baseline is used to represent cyclic and aliphatic compounds. Appropriate modifications were then applied to generate further histogram files. To view the the compounds clusters, a compound network diagram (CND) was made using Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org/).
At present, NVIK has 182 entries. The focus of the study was to evaluate small molecule inhibitors which were 125 entries as the rest 57 were either peptide or did not have complete information. Of these 125 entries, 98 are unique nipah inhibitors as for a few compounds more than one assay has been curated from the literature. Of these, EC50/IC50 values could be obtained for 70 compounds and structures are available for all 98 inhibitors. The EC50/IC50 values range from 0.25 nM to 7562710 nM for 182 entries and 0.47 nM to 7562710 nM for 125 small molecule entries. Some of these compounds are available in DrugBank and are predicted to have anti-nipah properties. The NVIK compounds are also mapped to Pubchem/Chemspider IDs wherever possible.
The overall distribution of important physicochemical properties of NVIs is depicted in Figure 2 . It can be observed that most compounds in NVIK are cyclic in nature. Clustering of 98 NVIs resulted in 90 clusters of which 84 clusters (93.3% of NVIs) were singletons while remaining 14 clusters (15.5% of NVIs) were non-singletons. This illustrates that the NVIK library is chemically diverse. These clusters are represented as compound network diagrams made using Cytoscape. (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/anshu/nipah/circos.php) and the clusters are also reported in CIRCOS. The innermost graph in Figure 2 represents the near neighbours among NVIs. An intriguing observation is that compounds with different molecular weight range are near neighbours. For example, GS-441524 (531.202 g/mol) is a near neighbour of GS-441524 (""NUC"") (291.267 g/mol). There may be common structural features in these compounds that are responsible for their activity against NiV (as highlighted). Therefore, this approach is useful in identifying potential pharmacophore features that are important in contributing to the antiviral properties of these compounds.
Comparison of NVIs is done with FDA approved compounds (2346) and antivirals obtained from Enamine library (4644). Enamine is a library of nucleoside like compounds (https://enamine.net/hitfinding/focused-libraries/view-all/antiviral-library). On the basis of physicochemical properties as suggested by Lipinski and Veber [33] it is observed that for the majority of NVIs, the distribution of all the six properties is similar to FDA approved drugs and also in some cases with Enamine compounds (Figure 3 ). Drugs with good oral availability, demonstrate TopoPSA ≤ 140 Å2 and number of rotatable bonds ≤ 10. 
In total, there are 34 NVIs similar to 76 FDA approved drugsf. For e.g, 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (NVIC0097) has shown structural similarity against four FDA molecules, namely, Adenosine (a neurotransmitter), Vidarabine (active antiviral against herpes, vaccinia & varicella zoster virus), Fludarabine (a chemotherapy drug) and Ademetionine (used in the treatment of chronic liver diseases). In addition, side effects and predicted rat toxicity as reported in DrugBank is also listed for FDA approved compounds similar to NVIs (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/anshu/nipah/fda_app.php). This can aid in prioritization of NVIs with a potential safe profile as opposed to the ones which have reported side effects.

In order to prioritize druglike NVIs, DruLito is used which screens all compounds based on eight filters, namely, Lipinski's rule, MDDR-like rule, Veber rule, Ghose filter, BBB rule, CMC-50 like rule, weighted and unweighted Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness [34] [35] [36] . As can be seen from Figure 4 only two of 91 compounds passed all filters other than CMC filter. 
In order to prioritize NVIs for further studies, we performed an independent evaluation of the compounds based on the robustness of the assays that were used to identify them. Based on this analysis, we prioritised 11 NVIs. Further analysis of these NVIs also indicated that they have physicochemical descriptor values which are closer to existing drug like FDA approved compounds. Our analysis of FDA approved compounds for several physicochemical parameters namely molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors, number of hydrogen bond acceptors, number of rotatable bonds, XlogP and topological polar surface area revealed that most prioritized NVIs have drug like features. As can be seen from Table 2 exhibits better activity among the three and has considerable overlap with the physicochemical properties of FDA approved drugs. The scope of the current study was to perform a systematic evaluation of physicochemical properties of NVIs with respect to FDA approved drugs and antiviral libraries, understand the diversity of chemical scaffolds and correlate these computed properties with the experimentally reported bioactivity datasets for proposing a list of prioritized candidates. In order to simplify data access and further enhancement of data libraries, a web-based platform is designed for reporting new compounds, further analysis and prioritization of potential NVIs.

013d9d1cba8a54d5d3718c229b812d7cf91b6c89,"Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan City, China, at the end of 2019 and has caused an outbreak of human-to-human","In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market [1, 2] . It has been determined that the pathogen causing the viral pneumonia among affected individuals is a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1, 3] . The pathogen exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly within and beyond Wuhan city [4, 5] . On January 30 th , 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [6] .
Wuhan is central China's transportation hub with a population of 11 million residents and a large number of higher-education students (~1.3 million in 89 universities and colleges), a particularly mobile population [7] . Beyond these factors, viral spread was likely exacerbated further by the surge in domestic and international travel during the 40-day Lunar New Year (LNY) celebrations (from January 10 th , 2020 to February 18 th , 2020) -the largest annual human migration in the world, comprised of hundreds of millions of people travelling across the country. As of February 4 th , 2020, China has reported 20,530 confirmed cases and 23,314 suspected cases with 2019-nCoV infections [8] . Of the confirmed cases, 2788 are severe and 426 people have died. Most cases were reported from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, and all provinces have confirmed cases imported from Wuhan and secondary transmission has been reported in some provinces. Additionally, there were 153 cases reported in 23 countries outside of China, with most having a travel history involving Wuhan [6] .
The potential pathway from this local outbreak in Wuhan to a pandemic might involve four steps: i) local transmission in Wuhan (primary city of epidemic); ii) spread from Wuhan to other cities within and beyond China via infected travellers, causing sporadic secondary transmission in these cities (secondary city of epidemic), iii) further spreading from secondary cities with local transmission to other tertiary cities in China and international cities via returning travellers after the LNY holiday; iv) onward transmission across multiple countries and leading to a pandemic. To interrupt the spread, a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, just two days before the LNY's Day. However, significant numbers of people had likely already travelled back to their hometowns for the holiday by this time. According to Wuhan authorities, it is .

Here we conducted a travel network-based analysis to explore patterns of domestic and international population movements from high-risk cities in China, and provide preliminary estimates of the potential risk of 2019-nCoV spreading across and beyond the country. Given the current epidemic and limited understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health interventions.
To identify the areas that are most vulnerable to virus importation, we performed and integrated a series of analyses, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone-based population movement data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. We defined the potential risk and geographic range of 2019-nCoV virus spread across three scenarios: 1) from the primary city (Wuhan) into other cities in mainland China (31 provincial regions), 2) from high-risk secondary cities into other cities across China, and 3) from high-risk cities in mainland China into cities in other countries or regions during the LNY holiday and the following three months. We also estimated the number of airline travellers likely needing to be quarantined or screened to capture travellers potentially exposed to 2019-nCoV in high-risk cities of mainland China.
To define daily patterns and the connectivity of population movements at county and prefecture (city) level across mainland China during the LNY holiday and the following three months, we used the aggregated and de-identified daily flow of the users of Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine [10] . Baidu offers location-based service (LBS), based on the global positioning system (GPS), IP address, location of signalling towers and WIFI, for online searching, mapping, and a large variety of apps and software for mobile devices. These data have been used to visualize population migration around Chinese New Year [10] . Two Baidu datasets were used in this study. The first one covers daily movement data at county level from December 1 st , 2013 to April 30 th , 2014, as described elsewhere [11] . We calculated relative .

Relative netflow = (inflow -outflow) / population of each county
The second dataset is a more recent daily movement matrix at the city level based on data from Baidu's search app from January 1 st , 2015 to April 30 th , 2015. The last recorded locations of a user (or device) for each day were compared, and if the location changed, then we counted the user (or device) as someone who had moved from one city to another city. To understand the spread risk of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan into other cities via domestic population movement, we aggregated daily outflows of people from Wuhan to other cities across mainland China for the two weeks (the quarantine period of the virus) prior to the cordon sanitaire of Wuhan. As the travel ban took place on January 23 rd , 2020, just 2 days before LNY's day, and given that LNY's day in 2015 was February 19 th , we took February 17 th , 2015 as a reference of the lockdown day in our dataset. Using the second dataset, then the risk of importation for each destination city or province was preliminarily defined as the percentage of travellers received by each city or province out of the total volume of travellers leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city's lockdown.
These secondary cities may have a high risk of community-level transmission through the introduction of infected travellers from Wuhan, and then spread the virus to other tertiary cities by returning population movements after the LNY holiday, causing an even wider spread of the virus. As most of the cities in Hubei province have implemented the same travel controls as Wuhan before LNY, we defined the high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei province as the cities within top 30 ranked cities (Supplementary Table S1 ) with the highest risk of importation from Wuhan defined above. Based on the 2015 Baidu dataset on population movement, the risk of spreading the virus from high-risk secondary cities to tertiary cities was preliminarily calculated as the averaged percentage of travellers received by each tertiary city out of the total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk secondary city during the four weeks following LNY's Day. We chose a period of four weeks because the returning flow of LNY's population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four weeks.

To define the connectivity and risk of 2019n-CoV spreading from Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities defined above, into the cities beyond mainland China, we obtained aggregated itinerary data from the International Air Travel Association (IATA) [13] . IATA data accounts for approximately 90% of passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, and these data represent direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We quantified monthly volumes of airline travellers departing Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities from February 1 st , 2018, through April 30 th , 2018. With the assumption that the population movements around the LNY holiday in 2020 was consistent with the pattern in 2018, all final destinations were ranked by volumes of airline travellers, and the relative risk of importation was defined as the percentage of airline travellers received by each destination city out of the total volume of travellers leaving high-risk cities in China.
We also estimated the number of airline travellers that may have needed to be kept in quarantine from Wuhan during the two weeks prior to the city's travel ban. The LNY's day in 2018 was on February 16 and the lockdown of Wuhan happened two days before LNY's day, corresponding to the date of February 14 th , 2018. We therefore defined the number of travellers needing to be quarantined as half of the volume of airline travellers from Wuhan in February, 2018, representing the 2-week total number of travellers for the first half of February. We then estimated the number of infections and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) in these airline travellers from Wuhan, based on a binomial distribution and the proportion of 2019-nCoV infections in the citizens evacuated from Wuhan reported by Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Germany, as of January 31 st , 2020 [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] .
Additionally, to capture travellers potentially exposed to virus, we also estimated the volume of airline travellers that would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April. Considering air traffic flows from China have changed due to the airline flight cancellations, travel restrictions imposed by countries or regions, or changes in travel behaviours, we calculated the volume of travellers using different scenarios of reductions (50%, 75%, and 90%) in total passenger volumes.

As we used historial data to predict travel patterns in 2020, to ensure that the seasonal patterns observed over LNY and holidays more generally are consistent over multiple years and countries, we collated country-level domestic and international passenger statistics for air travel from 2010 to 2018, and compared these against a comprehensive time series of public and school holidays across the world during the same period (Supplementary Note). Additionally, we also compared the spatial patterns of the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan, estimated by the population movement data in 2014 and 2015, and more recent data on the top 50 ranked origin and destination cities in January 2020, available from the Baidu Migration site (https://qianxi.baidu.com/). To futher validate our results, we also compared the importation risk estimated in this study with the number of reported imported cases from Wuhan to other provinces in mainland China, as of January 25 th , 2020, and the number of imported cases reported by other countries or regions, as of February 3 rd , 2020 [6] . The distribution between days of travelling from Wuhan, illness onset, first medical visit, and hospitalization of imported cases, as of January 25 th , 2020, were also analysed. These case data were collated from the websites of WHO, national and local health authorities or new agencies within and beyond China (Supplementary Note). R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to perform data analyses.
Significant migratory flows occurred in opposite directions before and after LNY's Day. In Wuhan City, mass movements of people began about three weeks prior to LNY, with the first peak of population leaving the city before the start of the winter holiday for universities, especially in the three counties that contain many universities and students (Figure 1 ). Although a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and some cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, the timing of this may have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan, as another peak of movements out of the city was seen 2 days before LNY's day.
We found that a large number of travellers were likely departing Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China before Wuhan's . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Other cities in Hubei Province received huge amounts of people during the two weeks before LNY and showed a decreasing population since LNY, following a peak of outflow at the end of the LNY holiday (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S2 ). If Wuhan's lockdown had not have been undertaken, our analyses suggest the main destination cities of population outflow since LNY would have been similar to the situation two weeks prior to LNY (Supplementary Table S3 ).
In terms of the initial importation risk of virus for each city during the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, nearly all other cities in Hubei Province were estimated to be high-risk areas (Figure 2a ). Other places with high risks were Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other large cities. In terms of the provincial level, the risks were high in Guangdong and Hunan, followed by Henan and Zhejiang (Figure 2b ). There was a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.59, p < 0.001) between the number of imported cases and the risk of importation estimated from traveller numbers from Wuhan within the two weeks before LNY's Day (Figure 3a ). Further, a high proportion of cases travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak, and the lag from illness onset to hospitalization decreased from a median of 6 days (Interquartile range: 4-7 days) in the first half of January 2020 to 3 days (1-5 days) in the second half ( Figure 4 ).
According to our definition outlined in the methods, the 17 high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei Province were identified as: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha, Xi'an, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanchang, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou, and Dongguan ( Figure 5) . Should community-level outbreaks occur in these cities, they could contribute to further spread of infection to other highly connected cities within China via movement after the holiday (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ).
Based on historical air travel data, the connectivity and spread risk between high-risk cities in mainland China and cities in other countries or regions was defined for the three months around the LNY holiday (Supplementary Figure S3 and Tables S4 and S5). Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Taipei ranked in the top three, followed by Seoul, Tokyo and Singapore. The main destinations were presented by region in the supplemental materials (Supplementary Figures S3-S9 and Table S4 -S7). During the two weeks before Wuhan's lockdown, there were an estimated total 59,912 airline .

Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan ranked in the top three, followed by Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Based on an overall infection rate of 1.39% (16/1149; 95% UI: 0.80% -2.25%) in citizens evacuated from Wuhan before Table S8 ). As of February 3 rd , 2020, a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.58, p < 0.001) was seen between the number of imported cases reported in those countries or regions and the risk of importation via travellers defined in our study (Figure 3b ).
Because significant intranational and international spread from Wuhan has already occurred, a very large number of airline travellers (6.5 million under the scenario of 50% travel reduction as usual, 3.3 million under 75% reduction, and 1.3 million under 90% reduction, respectively) would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China ( Figure 5 ) and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 (Table 1 and  Supplementary Tables S9 and S10) , to ensure that all travellers from high risk cities were covered.
Addtionally, based on monthly air passenger travel statistics and time series of public and school holidays in 91 countries from 2010 to 2018 (Supplementary Note), we found the seasonal pattens of domestic and international population movements across years were highly consistent with the timing and duration of public and school holidays in different countries (Supplementary Figure S10 and S11) . Moreover, we also found similar spatial patterns in the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan via population movements estimated by both the Baidu data in 2014 and 2015, and the more recent data covering the top 50 ranked destinations in 2020, (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S12) , highlighting the value of using historical data to rapidly assess present day risks.

Given the rapidly growing number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infections, increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission within and beyond China [4, 24] , and our limited understanding of this novel virus [25, 26] , the findings here from travel patterns in historical data and spread risk estimation can help guide public health preparedness and intervention design across the world [27] .
In terms of domestic connectivity and risk, the high population outflows from three counties in Wuhan with many colleges and universities in the first two weeks of January were likely college students leaving the city to avoid the peak traffic just one week before the New Year. Because of the early timing of this movement, many students might have avoided the period when the virus spread rapidly in Wuhan, and their risk of spreading the virus may be low as well. However, our results suggest that during the two weeks prior to Wuhan's travel ban, a large number of travellers still departed Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China and may have spread the virus to new areas, as the timing of the lockdown occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan. Further exacerbating this risk, we found that during the outbreak's initial stages, a particularly high proportion of cases travelled with illness caused by the virus, together with the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV through asymptomatic contacts, potentially causing additional transmission during travel [28] .
Moreover, several destination cities ( Figure 5 ) outside of Hubei Province that received high volume of travellers from Wuhan prior to LNY's day may serve as significant secondary cities in the outbreak. Most of these cities have large populations and international airports, highly connected with other regions within and beyond China. The initial imported seed cases likely caused the local community transmission, and further spread the virus into wider geographical ranges following the population flows occurring due to the LNY holiday [19] . Therefore, substantial public health interventions have been immediately applied across the country since LNY, including the cordon sanitaire in several of the most affected cities, cancellation of mass gatherings, reduction of travel and contact rate, as well as the extension of the LNY and school winter holiday, which might mitigate subsequent local establishment of 2019-nCoV introduced by travellers.
Beyond the cases that have occurred in China, air passengers have spread 2019-nCoV across countries and continents within a short time period [28, 29] .

Substantial preparedness efforts at destination cities should be taken to prevent further international seeding and transmission, otherwise the local establishment of epidemics, and even a pandemic, might become inevitable. For example, exit and entry screening may be futher extended to capture travellers with fever who have potentially been exposed to the virus in high-risk Chinese cities where local transmission has been established. However, we estimated that a huge volume of airline travellers would be required to be screened in February to April, even under the scenario of significant reduction (90%) in air passengers compared with the same period of previous years. Therefore, ensuring that surveillance and health systems around the world are ready and sufficiently strong to detect and deal with cases seen is a priority.
It is expected that further international exportation of cases from China will occur and cases may appear in any country [30] . Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the 2019-nCoV infection [6, 31] . Of additional concern is that the anticipated destinations of hundreds of thousands of travellers departing China are to low-income or lower-middle income countries, where inadequately resourced medical and public health systems might be unable to detect and adequately manage an imported case of 2019n-CoV, including possible subsequent community spread.
Due to current limited knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus at the time of writing (e.g. the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic or subclinical infections) and the rapidly changing situation of the outbreak, the simplicity of our approach to define importation risk can help to quickly update risk assessments, prioritise surveillance, target limited resources and understand the potential of 2019n-CoV introduction at specific destinations [32] . Compared with other studies [33, 34] , we explored the various scenarios of travel restriction and used a more comprehensive and spatio-temporally detailed population movement matrix, together with details on the actual final destination cities of air passengers based on the global itinerary dataset. These novel datasets provide new insights on the impacts of internal and international connectivity on potential transmission of this emerging pathogen during the LNY holiday and over the next three months.

Second, the mobile phone data used may provide an incomplete and biased picture of travellers, as the data only cover the population owning a smart phone and using Baidu apps. Third, the case data used in this study likely varies in quality and completeness due to the timeliness of reporting, varying laboratory diagnosis capacities, and differences in details announced on health authority websites. Fourth, compared with airline travellers leaving Wuhan prior to January 23 rd evacuees from Wuhan during the January 29 th -31 st period might have a higher risk of infection due to their longer stay in Wuhan during the potential continued spread of the virus since January 23 rd . This may result in overestimates of the number of infections in airline travellers from Wuhan prior to the city's lockdown. Based on more recent population movement and epidemiological data, we aim to conduct more sophisticated modelling approaches to assess the effectiveness of control measures in China, the impact of movements of people returning from LNY holiday, as well as the risks of a 2019-nCoV global pandemic.

However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours.

After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","The sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 poses a huge threat to human health worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe respiratory disease that can quickly spread from person to person and in some cases lead to death.
Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] . In recent epidemiological investigations of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and a preliminary study of the clinical characteristics of this disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , researchers have found that patients infected with the new coronavirus have severe symptoms similar to those of the SARS infection. The first batch of clinical data reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China revealed ""cytokine storms"" in critically ill patients [7, 8] . However, the mechanism of the viral infection and pathological changes in the immune system is still lacking. The sooner this information is added to the current clinical knowledge of these viruses, the better the control and treatment of this disease.
Here, we present an automated topic-wise inference method called TWIRLS (Topic-wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures) for processing the massive biomedical literature to summarize coronavirus host-related entities. TWIRLS is capable of collecting, classifying, and analyzing reported coronavirus studies to reveal these entities based on the distribution of specific genes in the text of the articles. By combining with general protein interaction data, links between certain functional cellular/physiological components can be inferred to fill the knowledge gaps on the probable mechanism of host pathological changes. eventually leads to acute lung injury in the host. Therefore, TWIRLS can be used to guide human researchers by providing further potential therapeutic target information for the treatment of acute viral lung injury based on the regulation of RAS.
Coronavirus-study specific entities and host genes As of February 21, 2020, the PubMed database included 14,878 biomedical articles on coronaviruses. We obtained text data (called local samples) from all related articles on the coronavirus that had been peer reviewed and published by human experts, which included the title, abstracts, author and affiliation information (total 3,182,687 words). The goal of the literature mining was to identify host genes and entities that are relevant to coronavirus research and to establish connections between them. An entity can refers to a word or phrase of the concept name (including related concepts, e.g., virus structure and chemical composition, source of infection, and virus type). The gene names were defined using the mammalian official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Naming Committee (HGNC) database. We directly retrieved 667 candidate genes from the local samples. By establishing a random distribution of one of the candidate genes in a control sample, the significance of this gene appearing in the local samples can be determined when the frequency of the current gene is an outlier of the random distribution of the control samples (see Methods for details). By calculating the odds ratio, we can also further determine the specificity of the association between this gene and the local samples. In this paper, we selected an odds ratio > 6 as the threshold for this judgment, which resulted in 123 coronavirus study-specific host genes (CSHGs).
To determine the specificity of the entity, we made a choice between different texts in the local samples. We removed numbers, symbols, verbs, and garbled characters to obtain clean versions of the local samples. The coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) were then identified in only the clean texts containing CSHGs. Based on the clean selected samples, we next built a local dictionary of candidate CSSEs containing 49,293 words after deduplication. Before calculating the random distribution of each entity, we included the synonymous entities into a same entity number (including singular or plural words, active and passive forms, different tenses, suffixes that do not change the meaning, etc.). For example, synonymous entities such as coronaviral, coronavirus, coronaviruses were grouped into one entity as coronavirus and assigned the same number (see entity number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 first column). The previous method of merging synonymous entities was based on a dictionary [9, 10] , which not only relied on the integrity of the dictionary, but also required a long retrieval time. To automatically solve the synonymous entity problem, TWIRLS classifies similar strings based on whether there is a significant statistical association between the character blocks in a set of candidate entities including various synonymous entities (see Methods). After cleaning and processing, CSSEs were identified by TWIRLS using a similar method to that for CSHG as described above.
For the candidate CSSE dictionary, a random distribution model for each entity was built by TWIRLS using the control samples. We identified 623 CSSEs (Table Sl, Sheet 1) based on the outliers discriminated by the random model and calculated odds ratio. For example, TWIRLS found 100 CSSEs close to ACE2, the receptor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (see left panel in Figure 1 ). The size of the entity represents the relative distance to ACE2, with a larger size indicating a closer distance to ACE2. Additionally, we present the CSSE cloud of the human receptor gene DPP4 of the MERS virus (see right panel in Figure 1 ).
Although TWIRLS only identified 623 CSSEs after collation, for human researchers, the information is scattered in words, which is limited for reconstructing understandable mechanistic models. Therefore, TWIRLS clusters CSSEs according to the rules defined by CSHG distribution, as genetic level research can accurately answer and solve physiological and pathological problems.
TWIRLS first calculated the specific co-distribution between CSHGs in local samples, then determined the distance between each pair of CSSEs and performs dichotomy clustering according to the linkage relationship between CSSEs and CSHGs. This classified the 623 entities into 32 categories represented as C0-C31 (see category number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 second column). In addition, for each category, TWIRLS also cited the top ten most relevant references for human researchers (Table S2) . Therefore, in any category, according to the CSSE and the most relevant literature, we can quickly provide ""Labels of conclusion-drawn-by-human-researcher"" (HR Labels) for this category. This label outlines the most relevant research directions of the current entity category. For example, for category C3, the HR label is ""Neurotrophic Coronavirus Related to Immune-Mediated Demyelination"". We have summarized the HR labels for the 32 entity categories in Table 1 .
The relative position of any CSHG to a certain CSSE can be estimated by TWIRLS (see Table S1 , the ranking matrix in Sheet 1). As each category contains different entities, we can determine whether a certain CSHG is significantly closer to each entity in the current category based on the ranking matrix between CSHG and CSSE. For example, the average distance between ACE2 and the 92 entities in category C5 is first calculated, then a random distribution model of the average distance between ACE2 and any of the 92 entities (3000-5000 times) is built, and finally, we determine if the average distance between ACE2 and entities in category C5 is significantly less than and deviates from the mean of the random distribution (Z score = -5.8416). The significance of each category associated with each CSHG is then scored by TWIRLS ranging between -10 and +10, with a smaller score indicating the current CSHG is more relevant to the current category (see the Z-score matrix in Table S1 , sheet 2). For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3).
Specifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus). We found that these two genes are assigned to the C5 category, which has a corresponding HR label of ""Spike protein (S) of coronavirus"", suggesting that TWIRLS can automatically provide an interface to summarize human findings and help human experts quickly understand the research directions and necessary knowledge in this field.
The distribution and meaning of the data can be compared to specific expression values of CSHG under different conditions (here, the category is used as a condition).

On the other hand, TWIRLS can also recommend the most likely and least likely categories for each signaling pathway. As an example, Table 3 shows the signaling pathways most likely associated with category C3 with the most unlikely corresponding category.
We coupled the data with gene interaction/regulation databases and constructed a generalized protein-protein interaction network (PPI network) among 119 genes out of the 123 CSHGs. We defined the direct interaction between two genes as a 1 degree (1 o ) interaction, and the indirect interaction connecting two genes through a gene as a 2 degree (2 o ) interaction. All the genes in the 1 o networks mined in the PPI database are shown in Figure 2 . The results after deduplication showed 2,004 pairs in the 119 CSHGs (see Table S1 , Sheet 4). As a control, the average interactions of 119 randomly selected genes in the database showed between 252 to 612 pairs (average 220.16, standard deviation 35.15). Compared to random genes, the regulatory connections between CSHGs were significantly enriched (Z score = 50.97).
Those CSHGs associated with a certain category had much closer interactions. For example, CSHGs associated with category C3 (or associated with C5 or C10) were closer to each other in the 1 o networks (Figure 2 ), suggesting that TWIRLS can possibly highlight important research directions and biology systems involved in coronavirus-specific research and can provide reliable interfaces for further automatic inference.
Several hub genes among the 119 CSHGs were further recommended by TWIRLS. Compared to a random sampling from all interactions recorded in the database, these hub genes had significantly increased numbers of interactions with the other 118 CSHGs. The recommended results showed that the three members of the IFITMs family (IFITM1-3) ranked first, second, and sixth among the top ten hub genes (CSSE cloud of the IFITMs family genes is shown in Figure 3 ; detailed ranking recommendation results are shown in Table S1 , Sheet 5). These IFITMs genes showed 115 interactions, accounting for 8.59% out of all 1,338 interactions of the 119 CSHGs.

The IFITMs family plays crucial roles in the induction of interferons during viral infections. Under the action of interferon, IFITMs disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and prevents the virus from entering the host cell [11] . However, TWIRLS did not directly associate IFITMs with any category, so we needed to provide more information so that TWIRLS can determine which part of these genes might be involved in the coronavirus infection and host body response.
Combining with generalized interaction databases provides richer interactions and regulatory linkages. We extended the 119 CSHGs to their 2 o networks based on the interactions with higher likelihood of connections (Combined score> 800). The 2 o networks expanded the number of genes from 119 host genes to 3,494 genes that may be associated with coronavirus (see Table S1 , Sheet 6 with DPP4 [12] . The different distribution of these receptors in the respiratory tract results in different degrees of infection. Although the infection ability of MERS is lower than in SARS, the mortality is higher (in about one-third of patients) because of the deeper infection site [13] . Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis. The ACE2 peptidase is a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). It is highly expressed in the heart, kidney, and testis, and is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues (mainly in the intestine and lungs) [14, 15] . Recent studies have shown that the binding of the S protein to ACE2 in the new coronavirus is 10 to 20 times stronger than in the SARS virus [16] , which may help the new coronavirus infect the host through the upper respiratory tract, significantly increasing its infectivity. Using TWIRLS, we were able to identify both ACE2 and DPP4 genes as CSHGs, and both were significantly associated with the C5 category. The HR label for this category is ""associated with S protein.""
In addition to ACE2 and DPP4, other CSHGs that are significantly associated with the C5 category include FURIN and TMPRSS2. The former may be required for the H7N1 and H5N1 influenza virus infections, probably via hemagglutinin-induced lysis, whereas the latter is widely reported to mediate and assist in the invasion of host cells by multiple viruses. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes and activates the spike glycoproteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), Sendai virus (SeV) and human interstitial pneumovirus (HMPV), and 1,2,3 fusion glycoproteins of F0, 4a, and 4b human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) [17, 18] . The function of this gene is essential for the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H7N9 strains). It is also involved in the hydrolysis and activation of hemagglutinin proteins, which are essential for viral infectivity [19, 20] . Although entities in the C5 category and in the cited literature mainly show that virus invasion is facilitated by virus-binding receptors and membrane proteases, the biological mechanism of the receptor binding to viruses leading to pathological changes has been reported less frequently.

These inferences are based on a process that finds new genes connected to different categories. The connected categories suggested potential regulatory relationships between different biological functions or phenotypes. The genes that serve as linkers are potential targets for gain-and loss-of-function experiments to identify those systems described by the meaningful entities in these categories.
In this paper, TWIRLS found the 2 o networks showed connections with certain CSHGs associated with categories or with no category. For example, TWIRLS found that CSHGs in the 2 o connections of IFITM1 were mainly concentrated in the C3 category (see Figure 4 ). Interestingly, CSHGs in the 2 o connections of ACE2 and DPP4 associated with C5 category were also enriched in C3 category, inferring that the information summarized in C3 category probably describe the underlying mechanisms of the pathological changes after coronavirus infection. In our analysis, the signaling pathways in C3 were mainly RAS, Vitamin D and RXR activation, and Chemokine signaling, with RAS being the most significant (as shown in Table 3 , which summarizes C3-related signaling pathways). which then linked to C3-associated cytokines including CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCR2, and CXCR3 ( Figure 5 ). Subsequently, these linker genes may contain information on the biological mechanisms that may be important for understanding the disease.
For example, TWIRLS recommended angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2 or AT2R) genes in the C3 category associated with ACE2. This supports that RAS is probably involved in the pathological changes caused by cytokine storms after S protein binds to ACE2, as suggested by other reports.
We next used TWIRLS to calculate the 1 o and 2 o networks of all 119 CSHGs. Based on the significantly enriched categories of CSHGs in the above networks, TWIRLS separately constructed models for the complex relationships of each CSHG. We found that 45.53% of the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This suggests that the biological mechanisms described by the C3 and C10 categories might be universally involved. Research on the entities, genes, pathways, and linker genes participating in the C3 and C10 categories could lead to new directions for the prevention, treatment, and clinical management of coronavirus infections.
In this study, we used TWIRLS, a machine-based approach to collect, summarize, and analyze about 15,000 biomedical articles related to coronavirus, with the aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying coronavirus-induced host pathological changes. Using TWIRLS, we found a possible mechanism involving ACE2/AT2R-RAS-Cytokine signaling, which becomes imbalanced under virus infection leading to cytokine storms. The TWIRLS system is an automated process that can summarize the entities and genes specifically related to coronaviruses. By combining this system with generalized interaction databases, we can reveal further associations that can provide a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms of the disease phenotype caused by virus-host interactions.
virus to ACE2 may disrupt this balance, which causes a steady-state imbalance of RAS, leading to subsequent pathological changes.
Although Ang II was originally described as an effective vasoconstrictor, there is growing evidence that it is closely involved in the inflammatory response of the immune system.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from immune cells normally regulate the RAS component, which further accelerates the formation of systemic and local Ang II [28] [29] [30] . In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the production of AGT in the liver and kidney [31] [32] [33] . On the other hand, RAS has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system. Angiotensin II regulates vascular tension and stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [34, 35] . The production and release of CXC chemokines can induce the accumulation of neutrophils in vivo [36] . Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have been used in a number of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathologies, and AT1R blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) were shown to have beneficial effects that were commonly attributed to AT2R activation [37] . At the same time, it was reported that Ang II-stimulated human endothelial cells had increased release of a CXC chemokine, IP-10. The IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10) is mainly expressed in the lung and is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. The expression of IP-10 has been observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites of tissue inflammation. Therefore, RAS dysfunction may result in the accumulation of cytokines, such as in the lungs leading to excessive accumulation of immune cells and interstitial fluid, blocking the airways and causing eventual death. As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced ""cytokine storms"" that was fatal [7] . Figure 6 summarizes the functional changes and pathological consequences of RAS system after ACE2 combines with the coronavirus.
We expect the mechanism summarized and reasoned by TWIRLS can be further supported by pathological evidence. To date, only one report of a post-mortem biopsy has been published with pathological data. Although histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, the right lung showed evidence of desquamation of All rights reserved.

We used PubMed, the most widely used database of biological literature, as the resource for the text mining. The schematic representation of the overall study design is shown in Figure 1 and can be summarized in the following steps.
The dataset used in this pipeline were from PubMed articles. First, PubMed was searched for articles including titles, abstracts, author and affiliation information containing the subject keyword ""coronavirus"". The search results were downloaded in txt format for compiling into structured information. The text in the subject abstract set was organized and cleaned, and then assigned to specific corpuses related to coronavirus (specific corpus) and compiled into the subject dictionary. To enhance the accuracy of the effective entities associated with the keyword, we used a random corpus for comparisons. We searched for article abstracts containing the keyword ""public health"" and compiled the abstract set into a random corpus, and then compiled them into a randomized control dictionary, which contains a wide range of proteins, genes, and related biological entities. We also considered a balanced amount of information by setting relevant parameters to adjust the amount of text before carrying out the statistical analyses.
Biological entity identification is a key step in the literature mining process [7, 8] . To ensure functionality of the extracted entity, we first compared the entity from the subject dictionary with the human official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Commission (HGNC) database [9] to generate subject candidate genes using standard nomenclature. In addition, the entities in the abstract were capitalized to avoid errors in the identification process. To obtain widely used gene entities that are precisely related to the subject and to determine the significance of the gene distribution in the specific texts, we calculated the difference in the distribution proportions. We searched for the subject candidate genes in the subject dictionary and the randomized control dictionary, respectively. We also counted the number of abstracts containing each subject candidate gene in each abstract set, respectively. Finally, we calculated the odds ratio of each subject candidate gene and sorted them into a list of precisely related genes (CSHG).
Similar to the process of identifying CSHG, we calculated whether entities were significantly distributed in a specific corpus. We counted the number of texts containing each CSHG in a specific corpus, and then counted the number of each candidate entity in the corpus subset. Next, we randomly selected the same amount of text from the random control corpus and then counted the number of each candidate entity in this subset of the random corpus. This was repeated 100-10000 times in the random corpus to generate candidate entities in the specified amount of text of the random distribution model. According to the central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of random sampling averages of randomly distributed data always conforms to a normal distribution. Therefore, we can use the Z score to evaluate whether an entity is significant in a specific text. Here, we used a Z score cutoff value > 6.
In addition, some entities have singular and plural noun forms, and synonyms with multiple forms in the abstracts. Therefore, we numbered the subject-related entity and automatically combined nouns with plural forms and homologous words with adjectives and adverb roots into the same entity, and then assigned them the same number.

Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or 8 affects a broad array of proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1,300 9 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9,900 proteins conserved 10 across mammals. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained 11 proteins from the cellular functions they hijack and that (ii) despite this high constraint, 12 virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in 13 humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across 14 all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions.

It is plausible that many VIPs might evolve to limit the impact of the viruses on the 5 host. However, it is unknown whether the war against viruses is fought by a 6 ""professional"" army of specifically antiviral proteins, or whether it is a global war fought 7 by a broad range of VIPs.
One reason to believe that the war against viruses might not affect evolution of a broad 9 array of VIPs is that, contrary to the pattern observed for specifically antiviral proteins, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We finally showcase the power of our global scan for adaptation in VIPs by studying the 4 case of aminopeptidase N, a well-known multifunctional enzyme (Mina-Osorio, 2008) 5 used by coronaviruses as a receptor (Delmas et al., 1992; Yeager et al., 1992) . Using 6 our approach we reach an amino-acid level understanding of parallel adaptive evolution 7 in aminopeptidase N in response to coronaviruses in a wide range of mammals.

Here we analyze patterns of both adaptive evolution and evolutionary 10 constraint/purifying selection in a large set of 1,256 manually curated VIPs from the low-11 throughput virology literature (Methods and Table S1 available online). We exclude Table S2 and Methods). VIPs in our dataset interact with viral 16 proteins, viral RNA, or viral DNA. Most of them (95%) correspond to an interaction 17 between a human protein and a virus infecting humans (Table S1 ). Human
Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the best-represented virus with 240 VIPs, with 19 nine other viruses having at least 50 VIPs (Table S1 ).
This dataset represents the largest, most up-to-date set of VIPs backed up by individual 21 low-throughput publications. Nonetheless, given that many VIPs were discovered only (Methods and Table S4 ). These 241 immune VIPs include the VIPs 2 classified as antiviral (Table S4 ) throughout this manuscript. In total, 162 overlapping GO 3 cellular and supracellular processes have more than 50 VIPs (Table S3) . These 4 observations confirm that viruses interact with proteins involved in the majority of basic 5 cellular processes. 
To disentangle whether the slower evolution of VIPs is due to stronger purifying 14 selection or to a lower rate of adaptation, we use the ratio of non-synonymous 15 polymorphisms to synonymous polymorphisms pN/pS rather than the dN/dS ratio. Unlike 16 dN/dS that is strongly influenced by both the effects of purifying selection and 17 adaptation, pN/pS is primarily determined by the efficiency of purifying selection in 18 removing deleterious non-synonymous mutations.
Genome-wide polymorphisms required to measure pN/pS at the scale of the proteome 20 have become available for humans (Abecasis et al., 2012) (1,000 Genomes Project) 21 (Table S5) , and chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutans (Prado-Martinez et al., 2013)
(Great Apes Genome Project) ( Table S6 ). The 1,000 Genomes Project and the Great The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint suited for the estimation of the pN/pS ratio in as many proteins as possible. Specifically, 1 we measure pN/pS as the average across non-human great apes (or as the average in 2 the 1,000 Genomes African populations; Supplemental Methods) using the data from the 3 largest chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan populations in order to further limit the noise 
In line with this, VIPs also show an excess of low frequency (≤10%) deleterious non-12 synonymous variants compared to non-VIPs ( Figure S3 ). In great apes, the average 
The higher level of purifying selection in VIPs might be due to the fact that VIPs 22 participate in the more constrained host functions, or, alternatively, because within each 23 specific host function, viruses tend to interact with the more constrained proteins. In 24 order to assess these two non-mutually exclusive scenarios we generated 10 4 control 25 sets of non-VIPs chosen to be in the same 162 Gene Ontology processes as VIPs (GO 26 processes with more than 50 VIPs; Table S3 and Methods).
In great apes, GO-matched non-VIPs still have a much higher pN/pS ratio compared to 28 VIPs, suggesting that VIPs tend to be more conserved than non-VIPs from the same GO The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint 6 permutation test P=0 after 10 9 iterations). The stronger purifying selection acting on VIPs 1 is apparent within most functions. Figure 1C shows stronger purifying selection in the 20 2 high level GO categories with the most VIPs. In all the 20 GO categories pN/pS is lower 3 in VIPs than in non-VIPs, and the difference is significant for 17 of these categories 4 (Table S3 ). This shows that within a wide range of host functions, viruses tend to target 5 the most conserved proteins.
Interestingly, even immune VIPs (Table S4 ) have a significantly reduced pN/pS ratio 7 compared to immune non-VIPs ( Figure 1C ), which suggests that immune proteins in 8 direct contact with viruses are more constrained. The reduction in pN/pS in non-immune 9 VIPs (no antiviral or any other immune function, Table S4 ) is very similar to the reduction 10 observed in the entire set of VIPs ( Figure 1C ). Table S3 Table S5 ). Since VIPs are more 23 constrained than non-VIPs and tend to have more non-synonymous deleterious low 24 frequency variants than non-VIPs (Figures 1 and S3 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/029397 doi: bioRxiv preprint 7
The classic MK test is known to be biased downward by the presence of slightly 1 deleterious non-synonymous variants and this bias is difficult to eliminate fully even by 2 excluding low frequency variants (Messer and Petrov, 2013) . Note that our application 3 of the classic MK test to discover the higher rate of adaptation in VIPs compared to non-4 VIPs is conservative given that the VIPs have a higher proportion of slightly deleterious We therefore apply an asymptotic modification of the MK test known to provide 10 estimates of α without a downward bias in the presence of slightly deleterious variants 11 (Messer and Petrov, 2013) . To further validate the asymptotic MK test we carry out 12 extensive population simulations (Messer, 2013) to show that this test is indeed robust to 13 a number of potential biases (Supplemental Methods and Table S8 ).
14 Using the asymptotic MK test we estimate that in VIPs, ~27% of the 1,897 amino acid 15 substitutions along the human lineage were adaptive ( Figure 1D ). This proportion is 16 three times higher than the estimated proportion of ~9% in non-VIPs ( Figure 1D ). Thus,
although VIPs represent only 13% of the orthologs in our dataset, we estimate that in 18 human evolution they account for almost 30% of all adaptive amino-acid changes. Note 
The high α in VIPs is not explained by higher rates of adaptation in the host GO 22 processes where VIPs are well represented ( Figure S4 and Methods). Furthermore, the 23 large difference in α observed between VIPs and non-VIPs is robust to a number of 24 potentially confounding factors such as recombination, GC content or gene length (Table   25 S9 and Supplemental Methods). The lower pN/pS in VIPs does not explain their higher α 26 either (Table S9 ).
We further use the classic MK test (excluding variants below 10%) to investigate the 28 excess of adaptation for the specific VIPs of ten human viruses and in the 20 high level 29 GO categories with the most VIPs ( Figure 1E and F). We do not use the asymptotic MK 
Finally and importantly, the 80% of VIPs with no known antiviral or broader immune 6 function (Table S4 ) have a strongly increased rate of adaptation according to both the 7 classic MK test (α=0.26 in VIPs versus -0.02 in non-VIPs, permutation test P=3x10 -7 ; 8 Figure 1F ) and the asymptotic MK test, with the latter estimating α=38% in non-immune 9 VIPs against only 11% for non-immune non-VIPs. Intriguingly, unlike for non-immune 10 VIPs or all VIPs considered together (top of Figure 1F ), immune VIPs, including antiviral 11 VIPs (Table S4) , do not show any increase of adaptation compared to immune non-
VIPs. We speculate that this pattern might reflect the masking effect of balancing The increased rate of adaptation in VIPs in the human lineage strongly suggests that 20 VIPs in our dataset, 95% of which interact with modern viruses (Table S1 ), were also 21 VIPs during past human evolution. It is also plausible that a substantial proportion of the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

For a specific coding sequence, the 2 BS-REL test estimates the proportion of codons where the rate of non-synonymous 3 substitutions is higher than the rate of synonymous substitutions (dN/dS>1), which is a 4 hallmark of adaptive evolution. The BS-REL test then compares two competing models 5 of evolution, one with adaptive substitutions and one without adaptive substitutions, and 6 decides which of the two models is the best fit. For each branch of the tree, the BS-REL 7 test provides a P-value that corresponds to the probability that no adaptation occurred in 8 the branch. The product of P-values across all branches in the tree then gives the 9 probability that no adaptation occurred anywhere along the entire tree (Supplemental 10 Methods).
The product of P-values is a good measure of whether a specific protein experienced 
The purifying selection-wise permutation test shows that adaptation has been much 29 more common in VIPs than in non-VIPs across mammals (Figure 2 ). We estimate that
VIPs have experienced 77% more adaptation compared to non-VIPs (Figure 2A) . In 31 total, this represents ~76,000 more adaptive amino acid changes in VIPs compared to 32 .

We further use an increasingly strict level of evidence for the presence of 1 adaptation, by including only proteins with increasingly low products of P-values; that is, 2 increasingly low probability that no adaptation occurred (Figure 2A ). Figure 
GO processes with a strong excess of adaptation include cellular processes such as 17 transcription, signal transduction, apoptosis, or post-translational protein modification, 18 but also supracellular processes related to development ( Figure 2C and Table S3 ).
Importantly, VIPs with no known immune function (Table S4) 
Since 95% of the VIPs were discovered for viruses infecting humans, it is possible that 24 the observed excess of adaptation in VIPs in mammals is due to higher rates of 25 adaptation exclusively in the primate branches of the mammalian tree ( Figure S1 ).
However, all mammalian clades in the tree show a similar excess of adaptation in VIPs 27 ( Figure 2D ). Primates stand out due to their low overall proportions of positively selected 28 codons compared to the other mammalian clades in the tree ( Figure 2D ). This is most The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

This phylogenetically widespread excess of adaptation 3 implies that many of the VIPs annotated in humans were also VIPs for a substantial 
To identify a new non-antiviral protein we first exclude all VIPs with a well-known 16 antiviral activity (Table S4 ) and then select all remaining VIPs with strong overall 17 evidence of adaptation (Table S10 ) and at least 10 branches with signals of adaptation.
Because we want to understand how adaptation to viruses proceeded, we then select 19 proteins with i) at least one available tertiary structure, ii) amino acid level resolution of 20 the interaction with one or more viruses, and iii) host tropism.
The most positively selected non-antiviral VIP that fulfills all these requirements is Figure 4D ). The consensus was regained only two times after loss 28 ( Figure 4D ). This means that the signals of adaptation detected at the first and third 
Although we already find a strong signal of increased adaptation, the amount of adaptive 18 evolution that can be attributed to viruses is probably underestimated by our analysis.
First, there may still be many undiscovered VIPs. Within the past few years, there has 20 been no sign that the pace of discovery of new VIPs is slowing down ( Figure S2 host? We show that there has been so much adaptation in VIPs that it is very hard to 23 imagine that none of these adaptive events had any consequences on host phenotypes.
Interestingly, VIPs tend to be multifunctional proteins. Indeed they represent 13% of all 25 the orthologs in the analysis, 33% of the orthologs with 60 or more annotated GO 26 processes, and 40% of orthologs with 100 or more GO processes ( Figure S8A ).
Pleiotropy is more likely in proteins with many functions (He and Zhang, 2006), and the 28 subset of VIPs with many annotated GO processes has an excess of adaptation that is 29 very similar to the one observed when using all VIPs ( Figure S8B ). Adaptation to viruses 30 could thus have affected the evolution of host phenotypes in unexpected ways. In this 31 respect, it is particularly intriguing that VIPs have experienced highly increased rates of 32 adaptation within host functions such as development or neurogenesis (Table S3) .

02201e4601ab0eb70b6c26480cf2bfeae2625193,"School closure is often considered as an option to mitigate influenza epidemics because of its potential to reduce transmission in children and then in the community. The policy is still however highly debated because of controversial evidence. Moreover, the specific mechanisms leading to mitigation are not clearly identified. We introduced a stochastic spatial age-specific metapopulation model to assess the role of holiday-associated behavioral changes and how","they affect seasonal influenza dynamics. The model is applied to Belgium, parameterized with country-specific data on social mixing and travel, and calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. It includes behavioral changes occurring during weekend vs. weekday, and holiday vs. school-term. Several experimental scenarios are explored to identify the relevant social and behavioral mechanisms. Stochastic numerical simulations show that holidays considerably delay the peak of the season and mitigate its impact. Changes in mixing patterns are responsible for the observed effects, whereas changes in travel behavior do not alter the epidemic. Weekends are important in slowing down the season by periodically dampening transmission. Christmas holidays have the largest impact on the epidemic, however later school breaks may help in reducing the epidemic size, stressing the importance of considering the full calendar. An extension of the Christmas holiday of 1 week may further mitigate the epidemic. Changes in the way individuals establish contacts during holidays are the key ingredient explaining the mitigating effect of regular school closure. Our findings highlight the need to quantify these changes in different demographic and epidemic contexts in order to provide accurate and reliable evaluations of closure effectiveness. They also suggest strategic policies in the distribution of holiday periods to minimize the epidemic impact.
Children represent an epidemiological group of central importance for the transmission of influenza [76, 95, 5] . They often have a larger vulnerability to infections because of limited prior immunity, and they mix at school with high contact rates [80] thus representing key drivers for influenza spread. The closure of school has been associated to the potential of reducing influenza propagation in the community by breaking important chains of transmission. It is expected to potentially delay the peak, and reduce the epidemic impact, at peak time and of the overall wave. Though not specifically recommended by the World Health Organization during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is envisioned as a possible non-pharmaceutical intervention for pandemic mitigation left to the decision of national and local authorities [12, 98] .
A large body of literature exists on the topic, however contrasting evidence lead to no definitive emerging consensus [22, 69] . Benefits and limita-tions appear to depend on the specific epidemic context. For example, influenza epidemics characterized by a larger attack rate in children compared to adults are expected to be more sensitive to the closure of schools [24] . This experience was reported in many countries during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, where closed schools coincided with a marked reduction of influenza activity [71, 82, 25, 64, 99, 28, 29, 79, 42, 43, 4, 33, 65] . School closure interventions are often considered along with other mitigation strategies, as it happened with social distancing in Mexico following the pandemic outbreak [35, 28] , making their effect more difficult to isolate. Studies generally report a slowing down effect in the incidence during closure, however in some cases the effect may be mixed with the natural decline of the epidemic, because of late implementation [69] . In addition, no clear trend is observed in the impact of school closure on the epidemic burden depending on the time of closure -before, around, or after the peak [69] .
Given its potentially important role in reducing the epidemic impact, school closure has more often been investigated in the realm of pandemics compared to seasonal influenza [69] . For the latter, regular school closure during holidays in temperate regions has been considered as a natural example to evaluate the impact of school closure [62, 23, 52] . Directly extending the application to pandemic situations has however important limitations. Closure associated to winter holidays is regularly scheduled in the school calendar, whereas school closure as an intervention corresponds to an unplanned interruption of school attendance that may take different forms (e.g. proactive vs. reactive, at the national or local level, with a gradual closure of classes or of the entire school) [22, 53, 49, 30] . In addition to the different nature of closure, also its duration changes from a fixed scheduled period of holidays to one of variable extension depending on the ongoing epidemic and resulting outcome. How individual behavior changes in all these conditions is the critical aspect to quantify in order to accurately assess the impact of school closure on transmission.
Transmission models fitting the 2009 H1N1 pandemic or parameterized to a similar pandemic scenario have been used to assess the value of school closure or summer holidays [79, 39, 4, 49, 30] . Few of them are based on estimates for social mixing changes [39, 4] , as data collected during a pandemic are limited [68, 39] , leaving other approaches to rely on assumptions about contacts that may critically affect the studies' findings. Applications to seasonal influenza may on the other hand count on a more accurate description of population mixing. Surveys conducted over the calendar year to measure variations of mixing patterns [61, 41, 40, 13] offer indeed the opportunity to perform data-driven modeling studies that mechanistically assess the role of school holidays on seasonal influenza. Interestingly, they also highlighted considerably large differences across countries in the way contacts change from term-time to school holidays [61] , suggesting the need for country-specific estimates to accurately and reliably parameterize models.
Changes in mobility is another important aspect that is rarely integrated in school closure studies. Travel is known to be responsible for the spatial dissemination of influenza [57, 94, 32, 46, 44, 47, 9, 10, 7, 4] . In addition to extraordinary travel drops in reaction to epidemics [2, 7, 84] , mobility changes regularly occur during school holidays compared to term-time [75, 45] . Moreover, important differences were highlighted in the mobility of children vs. adults and their associated variations, so that their coupling with social mixing changes occurring during holidays may have a considerable impact on the epidemic outcome [4, 45] .
Our aim is to explicitly integrate social mixing and travel from data into a modeling framework to assess how variations induced by regular school closure may impact seasonal influenza epidemics. Three modeling studies were developed so far with similar objectives. Towers and Chowell studied the impact of day-of-week variations in human social contact patterns on incidence data collected at a large hospital in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 H1N1pdm [90] . Their approach was not spatial, therefore did not consider mobility changes, and mainly focused on the sensitivity of influenza incidence variations to the latency period. Apolloni et al. used a stylized analytical approach to evaluate the role of age-dependent social mixing and travel behavior on the conditions for epidemic spatial invasion [4] . The model can compare different contexts, with or without schools in terms, and also account for associated changes. The contexts are however considered independently (no full school calendar can be considered) and the epidemic impact is evaluated only in terms of conditions for spatial dissemination. Going beyond these limitations, more recently Ewing et al. introduced an age-specific spatial metapopulation model to evaluate how behavioral changes associated to winter holiday impact the flu season [45] . The model is applied to the United States and it integrates data on travel behavior, whereas mixing is assumed from estimates available from Europe and adapted to summer holiday changes measured in the UK during the 2009 pandemic [39] . Their findings identify changes in mixing patterns as the key element responsible for the epidemic effects induced by holidays.
Given the central role of mixing patterns largely supported by evidence [22, 69, 4, 45] , the heterogeneous country-specific contact variations measured in Europe [80, 61] , and the marked difference expected in individual behavior during a seasonal flu epidemic vs. a pandemic, here we extend prior approaches to introduce a data-driven spatially explicit model fully parameterized on Belgium. The aim is to reduce assumptions in favor of input data, and to exclusively focus on seasonal influenza and associated parameterization. Contact data associated to four types of calendar days are considered, belonging to Regular Weekday, Regular Weekend, Holiday Weekday, Holiday Weekend (here 'regular' refers to non-holiday period), allowing us to assess the role of weekends in addition to holidays. A richer calendar with additional holidays beyond Christmas break is also considered. Confirming and extending prior results with a different modeling approach and input data would greatly support our understanding of the role of changes in mixing and travel on influenza epidemics.
In order to study the role of changes in contact patterns and in travel behavior along the calendar, we considered a mathematical approach for the spatial transmission of influenza in Belgium. We built a discrete stochastic age-specific spatial metapopulation model at the municipality level, based on demographic, mixing, and mobility data of Belgium. We parameterized it with influenza-like-illness (ILI) data reported by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health at the district level for the 2008/2009 season. By using the Belgian school calendar for that season, we assessed the impact of the individual changes in mixing and travel behavior during regular school closure, given by available data. We then tested experimental scenarios to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed epidemic outcomes. Here, we describe in detail the mathematical model, input data, calibration procedure and experimental scenarios.
nected through a coupling process generally describing hosts mobility. Here we consider the population to be divided into two age classes, children and adults, based on the modeling framework introduced by Apolloni et al. [4] . Infection dynamics occur inside each patch, driven by the contacts between and within these two classes, and spatial spread occurs via the mobility of individuals ( Figure 1 ). Both processes are modeled explicitly with a discrete and stochastic approach. The model is based on Belgian data and follows the time evolution of the 2008/2009 school calendar. It includes 589 patches corresponding to the 589 municipalities (nl. gemeenten, fr. communes) of Belgium. Weekends and school holidays are explicitly considered, and variations in mixing and travel behavior are accounted for in the model and based on data. In the following, we describe in detail the various components of the model.
Individuals are divided into children (c, age less than 19y) and adults (a, otherwise). Population size and age structure per municipality as of January 1, 2008 are obtained from Belgian Statistics [1] .
Social mixing between the two age groups is quantified by contact matrices extracted from the data obtained through a Belgian social contact survey [80, 61] :
where the element ij (i = a, c, j = a, c) is given by:
with M ij the average number of contacts made by survey participants in age class i with individuals in age class j, N j the population of age class j, N tot the total population of Belgium. C C C is defined at the national level, and here we assume that it is the same throughout the country, with the number of contacts being altered exclusively by the patch demography. From survey data, we have that the contact matrix for a regular weekday is:
C reg weekday C reg weekday C reg weekday = C cc C ca C ac C aa = 40.71 7.84 7.84 14.25 .

The figure reports as an example the contact matrix of a regular weekday (Eq. (3)). Mobility and mixing vary based on the calendar day (regular/holiday, weekday/weekend). Influenza disease progression at the individual level is modeled through a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered compartmental scheme, with β indicating the per-contact transmission rate, the rate from exposed to infectious state, µ the recovery rate.
Influenza disease progression is described through a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model ( Figure 1 ) [3, 74] . A susceptible individual can contract the disease with a per-contact transmissibility rate β from infectious individuals, then entering the exposed or latent class. After an average latency period of −1 = 1.1 days [15, 20] , the individual becomes infectious for an average duration µ −1 = 3 days [15, 20] and can transmit the infection, before recovering and becoming immune to the disease. A fraction of children (g c ) and adults (g a ) were considered immune to the disease at the beginning of the influenza epidemic, based on available knowledge on prior immunity and vaccination coverage in the country for the 2008/2009 influenza season and prior seasons (g c = 39.87%, g a = 53.19%) [100, 72, 89] .
The force of infection for a susceptible individual of age class i (i = a, c) in a given patch p is given by:
where j runs on age classes, I p j (t) and N p (t) count the total number of infectious individuals of age class j and the total population size of patch p at time t, respectively. This quantity changes with time for two reasons. The first is the school calendar, distinguishing between regular weekdays, regular weekends, holiday weekdays, holidays weekends, and accounted for by C ij (t). The second is the mobility of individuals. At a given day of the simulation, each patch p may include: non-commuting residents of p, commuters from neighboring patches for school/work, commuting residents of p after school/work (see paragraph 2.1.3).
Coupling from patch p to patch q is given by the mobility of age class i, i.e. f pq (i) (Figure 1 ). We considered commuting data across patches from the 2001 Socio Economic Survey of the Belgian Census [66] to describe the regular mobility of individuals for school/work during a regular weekday. Data are not age-specific, so we extracted the commuting fluxes per age class based on the probability of children (adults) of commuting on a given distance computed on the French commuting data [67] . Such inference was based on the assumption of a similar mobility behavior across the two neighboring countries.
Air travel was not considered due to negligible internal air traffic within the country.
Changes in social mixing are based on the data of the Belgian social contact survey [80, 61] , where participants were asked to report their number of contacts during a regular weekday, a regular weekend, a holiday weekday or a holiday weekend. In addition to the contact matrix of Eq.
(3), we have:
C reg weekend C reg weekend C reg weekend = 12.51 6.00 6.00 10.85 for a regular weekend,
C hol weekday C hol weekday C hol weekday = 14.02 7.28 7.28 12.29 for a holiday weekday,
C hol weekdend C hol weekdend C hol weekdend = 10.89 7.20 7.20 8.59 for a holiday weekend.
Concerning variations in mobility, schools are closed during weekends and holidays, so no commuting exists for children in those days. We considered adults to continue commuting during holiday weekdays, assuming that adults' time off of work would be homogeneously distributed throughout the year. Concerning adult mobility during the weekends, we estimated the travel fluxes reductions based on statistics available for France [88], based on the same assumptions explained in paragraph 2.1.3. The resulting agespecific reductions for mobility are defined in Table 1 . 
Time is discretized considering a time step of dt = 0.5 days, with one timestep corresponding to the activities performed during a workday (i.e. commuting, social mixing), followed by a time step corresponding to the activities performed out of that timeframe (i.e. social mixing), as typically done in agent-based epidemic models [79] . Influenza transmission within each patch is modeled with binomial processes. Starting from the initial conditions set by influenza-like-illness surveillance data, we performed 2·10 3 stochastic runs for each model under study.
Our model was based on the official Belgian school calendar for school year 2008/2009. Classes in Belgium are in session from Monday to Friday, and schools are closed during the weekends. The calendar included the following holidays for the 2008/2009 academic year during which schools were closed:
• Fall holiday: from October 25 to November 2, including the public holiday of the first and second of November;
• Public holiday of November 11;
• Christmas holiday: from December 20, 2008 to January 4, 2009;
• Winter holiday: from February 21 to March 1;
• Easter holiday: from April 4 to April 17;
• Long weekend: from May 1 to May 3, around the public holiday of May 1;
• Long weekend: from May 21 to May 24, around the public holiday of May 21;
• Long weekend: from May 30 to June 1, around the public holiday of June 1.
From July 1 to August 31 schools are closed for the summer holidays.
We used influenza surveillance data collected by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health [91] . Data report new ILI episodes registered each week by the network of sentinel general practitioners (GP). ILI is defined as sudden onset of symptoms, high fever, respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat) and systemic symptoms (headache, muscular pain). For every episode, additional information is reported: age group (<5, 5-14, 15-64, 65-84, 85+), hospitalization, antiviral treatment, vaccination status, municipality of residence. The use of ILI surveillance data to approximate influenza incidence is a usual practice [81, 96, 56] and in the case of Belgium previous work showed good agreement of ILI data with virological data [16] and robustness across different surveillance systems [92] . Surveillance data on the new number of cases were aggregated at the district level to reduce signal noise.
The metapopulation model was calibrated to the 2008/2009 influenza season. Though the simulated dynamics is spatially explicit, calibration was performed on Brussels district only, i.e. by comparing the simulated incidence profile of Brussels to the incidence ILI data for that district. We did not consider calibrating the model also in the remaining districts, as these were used for validation.
The model was seeded with the first non-zero incidence value provided by surveillance data per district and accounted for possible sampling biases. We used a bootstap/particle filter Weighted Least Square (W LS) with 20 particles to calibrate our model fixing the epidemiological parameters described in paragraph 2.1.2 and obtain the per-contact transmissibility β. Calibration was performed on normalized incidence curves to discount effects due to unknown GP consultation rates.
To assess the impact of variations in contacts and mobility due to school closures, we compared the realistic model based on the Belgian school calendar and integrating the changes described in paragraph 2.1.4 with a set of experimental scenarios that we describe here. 11 All rights reserved.

To estimate the relative importance of variations in social mixing vs. variations in travel behavior, we considered:
• the travel changes model, where only variations in mobility occurring during weekends and holidays are considered, whereas social mixing is fixed as on a regular weekday;
• the mixing changes model, where only variations in social mixing occurring during weekends and holidays are considered, whereas travel is fixed as on a regular weekday;
• the regular weekday model, where no variations are considered, and social mixing and travel behavior are fixed as in a regular weekday.
To assess the role of each school holiday period, we considered scenarios where each period was removed, one at a time:
• the w/o Fall holiday model, where the holiday period from October 25
to November 2 was removed;
• the w/o Christmas holiday model, where the holiday period from December 20, 2008 to January 4, 2009 was removed;
• the w/o Winter holiday model, where the holiday period from February 21 to March 1 was removed;
• the w/o Easter holiday model, where the holiday period from April 4 to April 17 was removed.
In all cases, the holiday period is substituted by the regular course of the week, with regular weekdays and regular weekends. In addition, we tested the w/o holiday model, where all holiday periods of the calendar are removed, and only the week structure is kept. We also considered a synthetic scenario where we extended the Christmas holiday of one week, before the start of the break, or after its end, referred to as the Christmas holiday extension models.
To assess the interplay between the timing of the epidemic and that of the holiday periods, we considered anticipation and delays of the start of the epidemic season, as follows:
• the 4 weeks anticipation model (−4w ), where the start of the simulated influenza epidemic is anticipated 4 weeks prior to the start of the realistic model calibrated on the empirical data;
• the 2 weeks anticipation model (−2w ), as above with an anticipation of 2 weeks;
• the 2 weeks delay model (+2w ), as above with a delay of 2 weeks;
• the 4 weeks delay model (+4w ), as above with a delay of 4 weeks.
In all these cases, the start of the epidemic is the only aspect that is being altered, whereas the school calendar (and associated variations in social mixing and travel behavior) remains fixed.
We analyzed the spatial distribution of the force of infection determined by the demographic profile in space. To do so, we studied the distribution of the patch reproductive number R p that can be calculated as the largest eigenvalue of the next-generation matrix [38, 97] . This is done for the four types of days considered in terms of their variations of social mixing, namely regular weekday, regular weekend, holiday weekday, and holiday weekend.
Validation of the model is performed by comparing the simulated incidence profiles to the empirical surveillance data at the national and at the district level. In particular, we looked at the peak difference per district d per stochastic run r:
where T d (r) is the peak time of weekly incidence of run r in district d and T d ILI is the incidence peak reported from surveillance data in the same district. Medians per patch over 2 · 10 3 stochastic runs are computed. Scenario analyses are performed in order to assess the difference of an experimental scenario with the realistic model. We quantified the various comparisons in terms of:
• the peak time difference per patch ∆T p = T p scenario − T p realistic model , with T p the median peak time of the incidence curve in patch p computed on all stochastic runs (for both the scenario under study and the realistic model);
• the peak incidence relative variation per patch ∆I p = (I p scenario − I p realistic model ) /I p realistic model , with I p the median incidence value at peak time in patch p;
• the epidemic size relative variation per patch ∆σ p = (σ p scenario − σ p realistic model ) /σ p realistic model , with σ p the median epidemic size in patch p.
Medians and 50%, 95% confidence intervals at the patch levels are computed for synthesis. In addition, medians, 50%, 95% confidence intervals of the simulated incidence ate also calculated at the national level across the tested scenarios.
Season 2008/2009 shows an ILI incidence that reaches its peak in week 5 of 2009, both in Brussels district and at the national level. The incidence is visibly slowed down during Christmas holiday (Figure 2) , suggesting that holiday periods may have a measurable effect on transmission. The simulated peak time is found to be within one week of the empirically observed time for 76% of the districts, and within two weeks for 90% of them. Only two districts in the Province of Luxembourg showed greater discrepancies (four weeks). We observed a mild tendency towards a radial increase of the peak time difference from Brussels to the edge of the country, with 4 weeks difference obtained on the border between Belgium and Luxembourg.
The average patch reproductive number is estimated to be R = 2.12, corresponding to β = 0.0850 ([0.0674, 0.0858] 95% confidence interval (CI)) of the per-contact transmissibility obtained from the calibration procedure (see Methods). The variation of R p at the patch level is given by the demographic profile of the population and its immunity profile. In addition, it also depends on the day type considered, whether regular or during a holiday, whether during the week or the weekend (Figure 2 ). Larger variations and higher values are obtained for a regular weekday, having the largest number of contacts, compared to less heterogeneous distributions and smaller R p values 14 All rights reserved.

To assess the impact that changes in the social mixing or travel behaviors of individuals have on the epidemic outcome, we tested different experimental scenarios where we independently singled out these aspects. These scenarios 15 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. Changes in individual behavior induced by weekends and holidays are found to strongly alter the epidemic dynamics leading to a considerable delay of the peak time (median of 3.7 weeks across patches, regular weekday model compared to the realistic model, Figure 3b ) and smaller peak time incidence (33% median relative change, Figure 3d ) and total epidemic size (11% median relative change, Figure 3c ).
Once the variations in individual behavior affecting social mixing or mobility are considered in isolation, social mixing variation during weekends and holidays is found to be mainly responsible for the effects just described. The travel changes model is indeed comparable to the regular weekday model, whereas neglecting changes in mobility (mixing changes model) produces epidemic patterns very similar to the realistic model (zero median variations).
The school calendar in Belgium during the influenza season counts four long holiday periods: Fall holiday, Christmas holiday, Winter holiday, Easter holiday (see Methods). Cumulatively, all holidays concur to delay the peak time of 1.7 weeks and to reduce the epidemic size of approximately 2%, with a reduction of the peak incidence (4%, all median values across patches, Figure 4 ). Among all holiday periods, the largest effect is produced by the Christmas holiday, responsible for the overall reduction of the epidemic size and a peak delay of about 1 week. The early break of Fall holiday has negligible impact instead. Winter holiday leads to a very small reduction of the epidemic size (median of 1%), but no effect on the peak timing or peak incidence. The impact of Easter holiday is negligible on all indicators. By comparing the effect of the regular weekday model (Figure 3 ) with the one of the w/o holiday model (Figure 4) , both on the realistic model, we find that weekends have a major effect in slowing down the epidemic curve: a difference of ∆T p = −3.7, [−3.9, −3.6] weeks when no weekends are considered compared to ∆T p = −1.7, [−1.9, −1.2] weeks when they are included.
Given the major role of Christmas holiday, we also tested the effect of 1-week extension, before or after the break. The extension before Christmas holidays does not impact the resulting epidemic (Figure 4 , panels d-e-f). If the additional week of holiday is considered after the break, no changes to the epidemic timing are observed, however the incidence at the peak decreases of 4% (median values), respectively.

Christmas holidays are found to be the school closure period with the highest impact on the epidemic outcome, on both its timing and burden, for the 2008/2009 influenza season. Here we assess how this result may vary depending on the timing of the season, by investigating its interplay with the school closure calendar. In order to distinguish between effects induced by the timing of the in-18 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We explored anticipations and delays of this epidemic of two or four weeks and compared the results with the realistic model.
The strongest impact is observed for the earliest epidemic (−4w model) reporting a median anticipation of more than one week with respect to the realistic model (once discounted for the earlier start) and a median reduction of the peak incidence of about 10% ( Figure 5 ). All other epidemics are rather similar to the realistic one, except for the −2w model reporting a considerable reduction of the peak incidence (median of approximately 13% across patches). In addition, it is important to note that, differently from previous effects, the anticipation or delay of the season leads to a considerably larger variation of the simulated epidemic indicators across patches, signaled by the larger confidence intervals reported in Fig. 5 . 
In this study, we considered the impact of regular school closure on the spatio-temporal spreading pattern of seasonal influenza. We focused on the case study of the 2008/2009 influenza season in Belgium. We used a spatial metapopulation model for the transmission of influenza in the country, based on data on contacts and mobility of individuals, and integrating data-driven changes in mixing and travel behavior during weekends and holiday periods. The model calibrated on a single district (i.e. a subset of patches, ∼ 3% of the country total) is able to reproduce with fairly good agreement the empirical pattern observed in the country for that season, suggesting that data-driven mixing and mobility are crucial ingredients to capture influenza spatial dynamics [94, 18, 36, 10, 79, 39, 4, 26, 45] . The result is a spatially heterogeneous propagation where the two ingredients act at different levels.
Mixing is patch-dependent and determined by the local demography. The large variations observed in the distribution of children vs. adults lead to heterogeneous distributions of the values of the reproductive numbers per patch. In specific mixing conditions -e.g. those of a holiday weekenda large fraction of patches has R p 1, indicating that those locations are found to be close to the critical conditions for epidemic extinction. Influenza is mainly sustained in patches having larger R p during those periods, and epidemic activity is then transferred to other patches through the mobility of infected individuals. Three-fourth of Belgian districts reach their epidemic peak in the simulations within one week of the empirical peak time. Districts exhibiting greater delays lie on the border of the country. This may be due to the model neglecting the mobility coupling between these regions and the neighboring countries, which is considerably large in some districts (e.g. the flux of individuals of the Luxembourg province commuting abroad represents almost 40% of the total flux of commuters of the district). Our study considered the country to be isolated for the sake of simplicity. We expect this border effect to be increasingly negligible for larger countries.
The simulated incidence profile clearly shows a slowing down in the growth of the number of new infections during the Christmas break, as reported by sentinel surveillance in the country, suggesting that holiday is associated to temporary reductions in influenza transmission. This was also found in previous empirical studies [23, 45] . To identify the mechanisms behind this effect, we isolated the changes in mixing and those in travel behavior during school closure, comparing different experimental scenarios, similar to Ewing 20 All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/230565 doi: bioRxiv preprint et al. [45] . We found that mixing changes during weekends and holidays lead to a considerable delay of the epidemic, whereas travel changes would produce no noticeable effect. Moreover, changes in the social contacts would explain the entire difference observed between the realistic model based on the calendar and a model that does not include school closure. This confirms prior modeling findings on winter holidays for several influenza seasons in the United States [45] . In contrast to that work, we found however that an important mitigation of the epidemic impact at peak time also occurs, besides the peak delay.
The strong impact of the variation of mixing behavior is easily interpretable in terms of the reduction of the transmission potential expressed by the reproductive numbers per patch. This mainly results from the reduction of the number of contacts between children, as measured by the social contact survey conducted once schools are closed [61] . Travel changes, on the other hand, do not act directly on the transmission potential but affect the coupling force between epidemics in different patches and the opportunity for individuals to be exposed to the disease. For this reason, changes in travel behavior have a smaller effect that is found to be negligible for influenza epidemic spread, as also observed in the work of [45] . This is also consistent with the large literature on travel restrictions showing the little or no effect that these interventions have on pandemic spatial spread [32, 63, 46, 31, 44, 11, 18, 7, 84] . In addition to holidays, we also found that the closure of school during weekends has a visible effect on the epidemic, periodically dampening transmission, similarly to what observed in [90] . This is generally not reported by influenza surveillance systems, as data are collected on a weekly basis.
For the 2008/2009 influenza season we found that Christmas holiday, occurring during a growing phase of influenza activity, is the school break responsible for the largest impact in terms of timing (about 1 week anticipation if holiday is not observed), along with a 5% reduction of the epidemic size. If the school break occurs earlier (as for the Fall holiday) or much later in the influenza season (e.g. Easter holiday), no effect is produced on the resulting epidemic. The case of Winter holidays occurring during the fadeout of the epidemic shows that a small reduction of the total number of cases can still be achieved with school closure after the epidemic peak, whereas other studies showed minimal impact [45] .
The analysis on a single season illustrates well how the epidemic impact of school closure depends on the interplay between closure timing and in-fluenza season. By systematically exploring this interplay through synthetic scenarios, we confirm the importance of Christmas holiday in mitigating the influenza epidemic. Most importantly, we found that the break would have the largest impact for a very early season when school closing would occur at or around the epidemic peak. Reduction in transmission due to fewer contacts leads to a strong reduction of the incidence and ultimately of the total epidemic size, as also observed in pandemic settings [69] . In the other synthetic influenza seasons explored, a rebound effect was obtained when schools reopened after the break, most notably for the early season anticipating of two weeks the 2008/2009 influenza epidemic (-2w model). This was previously observed in other contexts [60, 48, 17, 8, 14, 62, 6, 35] , also when no additional interventions beyond school closure were considered [48, 62] . The various tested scenarios show that Christmas break would have a larger mitigating impact if it occurs before (or around) the peak and when the incidence is about half the peak value or larger.
Our investigation shows that the role of holiday timing can be hardly inferred from few examples, and that other breaks beyond Christmas [45] may have an important mitigating impact. Also, the effect of a sequence of holidays occurring in an influenza season cannot be simply derived as a sum of the effects of each holiday period considered separately. Each break indeed affects the epidemic in a different way, altering its subsequent evolution in a non-linear way, so that the full calendar needs to be considered. Our findings help shedding light on previous empirical findings showing no clear pattern for the effects of school closure on peak incidence or total epidemic size, comparing closures before and after the peak [69] .
In addition to school breaks already occurring in the calendar, we also explored a possible extension of Christmas holiday of one week. We chose this break as it led to the largest epidemic impact in our case study, and also because it generally occurs before the influenza epidemic peak (this is the case for all influenza seasons from the studied season to the current one, pandemic season excluded). As such, we expect it could have a favorable impact on the epidemic outcome in the majority of influenza seasons. Previous work analyzing the length of school closure found that two weeks or more appear to be enough to result in a recognizable effect [48, 62, 23, 99, 6] , whereas shorter closures may not be beneficial or may not have an obvious impact [37, 34, 70, 86, 19] . Our synthetic results show that the extension would be advantageous only if implemented after the Christmas break, with a mitigation of the peak incidence and a minimal peak delay of a few days. Extensions are generally considered in the realm of reactive closures against a pandemic influenza.
Here we decided to test this scenario as a regular closure given that -in a broader context -authorities in Belgium are currently discussing whether to modify the school calendar for pedagogical reasons: the aim would be to reduce summer holidays and redistribute holiday periods throughout the year [54] . We found that an extension of the Christmas holiday would be beneficial in the management of the influenza season potentially mitigating its epidemic impact.
Our findings are obtained on seasonal influenza, and results on peak delay were also recovered by modeling works on synthetic influenza pandemics considering reactive school closure [79] . The straightforward extension of our conclusions to the pandemic case faces however several challenges. First, effects induced by school closure may be specific to the specific epidemic profile, and therefore they may lead to different results depending on the pandemic under consideration [22] . For example, beneficial effects of school closure during 2009 H1N1 pandemic may have resulted from the larger magnitude of children attack rates vs. adults. Epidemic contexts more homogeneously impacting age classes may be less affected by school closure. Second, the nature of the school closure may alter the behavior of individuals during that period. In our study we considered holidays that are regularly planned in the school calendar and associated to specific social activities (e.g. vacation trips, family visits and others), for which contact data are available [61] . School closure during an influenza pandemic may be envisioned as a proactive or reactive measure to the ongoing outbreak. Not being planned, it is expected to have a stronger disruptive impact on social mixing of individuals on the short term compared to regular closure. On the other hand, it is argued that prolonged closure may limit the reduction of contacts on the long term, because of costs and logistics, and reduction in compliance rate [23, 22] . Having shown here that changes in social mixing represent the single element critically responsible for the impact of school closure on the epidemic outcome, we note that modeling results on school closure in the case of a pandemic would strongly be affected by assumptions considered for mixing changes, in absence of data.
While a large body of literature has recently focused on behavioral changes during an epidemic [51, 83, 85, 50, 93] , still little is known to quantify them [68, 39, 61, 41, 40, 101, 102, 27, 77] . Our work focused on Belgium, as a rather detailed survey was conducted in the country to estimate contact rates in the population of different age classes at different periods of the calendar year [61] . These estimates constituted the input data to parameterize our spatial modeling framework. Modeling approaches to study epidemics in settings where no data exist are often based on the assumption that mixing would reduce following school closure and import estimates available from other settings or epidemiological contexts [79, 49, 45] . This may lead to several issues. Contacts and their changes along the calendar may be country-specific [80] , thus affecting epidemic results when applied to a different context. Estimates of the overall reduction of the number of contacts during school closure vary widely. Transmission models fitted to epidemic data estimated reductions ranging from 16-18% for holidays during seasonal influenza in France [23] , to 25% in Hong Kong for proactive school closure during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [99] , to 30% for the social distancing interventions (including school closure) implemented in Mexico following the start of 2009 pandemic [28] . A large-scale population-based prospective survey in Europe estimated the changes in contact patterns for holiday versus regular period to correspond to a reduction in the reproductive number as high as 33% for some countries, whereas for others no significant decrease was observed [61] . Finally, such overall reduction does not allow to fully parametrize a contact matrix. Such evidence does not support the parameterization of mixing changes from different countries and/or epidemic situations (e.g. seasonal vs. pandemic) [45] . The reduction is expected to be heterogeneous across mixing groups, because of compensatory behaviors (e.g. children drastically reduce children-children contacts but increase childrenadults contacts during holidays) [61, 40] . Assumptions on the relative role of specific age classes in absence of data may lead to biases in the modeled epidemic outcome, especially for epidemics reporting large differences in attack rates in children vs. adults. Our work highlights the need to expand our knowledge on contacts and associated changes induced by social activity or by the epidemic itself, in order to better parameterize models and provide reliable and accurate results for epidemic management.
Our study has a set of limitations that we discuss in the following. The host population is divided into two classes only. While a larger heterogeneity is known for the distribution of contacts across age classes [80] , our approach still accounts for the major role of children vs. adults in the spread of the disease. Moreover, the validation analysis shows that considering children and adults and the associated mixing and travel behavior is enough to reproduce the spatio-temporal unfolding of the epidemic to a good accuracy. Also, we did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic infec-tions. Santermans et al. [87] investigated the importance of dealing with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in an epidemic setting based on differences in mixing patterns between ill and healthy (as a proxy for asymptomatic) individuals. Future research should focus on combining the work of [87] with the study outlined here.
The study is focused on one season only, the 2008/2009 influenza season. Additional seasons may clearly be included in the analysis, however our choice aimed at discounting season-specific effects to avoid uncertainties and discordance found in previous works. Also, we argue that the main effect behind the observed impact is in the interplay between the incidence profile and holidays timing, all other aspects being equal. To fully assess this aspect, we systematically explored earlier and later epidemics than the 2008/2009 season, thus synthetically accounting for other (similar) influenza seasons. We did not consider age-specific susceptibility, as it was largely addressed for example in studies related to the A(H1N1)v2009 pandemic [21] . It would be interesting to explore its effects in future work in addition to social mixing and mobility, thus investigating additional seasonal influenza profiles.
Our experimental scenarios in travel changes and mixing changes models consider neglecting travel changes and mixing changes in an independent way. The two aspects are expected to be intrinsically dependent, however no study has yet quantified this dependency that could inform a better experimental design. Also, we did not take into account uncertainties associated to the social contact rates estimated from the survey data, as previous work showed their limited impact in fitting serological data [55] .
Mobility changes from commuting during regular weekdays to non-regular travel during weekends is obtained from travel statistics. We lack however specific data on travel behavior for adults during school holidays. We therefore assumed that adults would continue commuting during holiday weekdays. While we expect that a fraction of adults would stop commuting at least for few days during breaks as they take time off work, we expect this change in travel fluxes (compensated by additional trips to visit families [45] ) to have a negligible effect on the simulated epidemic. More drastic changes on travel, i.e. fully neglecting travel changes as in the mixing changes model, indeed did not alter the resulting epidemic.

With a data-driven spatial metapopulation model calibrated on the 2008/2009 influenza season in Belgium, we showed that regular school closure considerably slows down influenza epidemics and mitigate their impact on the population, because of changes in social mixing that are empirically measured. This may help the management of epidemics and lessen the pressure on the public health infrastructure. The effect is due to both school holidays and weekend closures, the latter periodically dampening transmission. Variations in travel behavior do not lead instead to visible effects. The observed impact strongly depends on the timing of the school closure, and to a lesser extent on its duration. Christmas holiday is the school break generally playing the most important role in mitigating the epidemic course, though variations are observed depending on the influenza season (e.g. early vs. late epidemic). The addition of one week extension after Christmas holiday may represent an additional strategy to further delay the epidemic peak and mitigate its impact.

0255ea4b2f26a51a3bfa3bd8f3e1978c82c976d5,"Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a powerful tool to understand and control plant metabolic pathways, which is central to plant biotechnology. PTGS is commonly accomplished through delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells. Standard plant siRNA delivery methods (Agrobacterium and viruses) involve coding siRNA into DNA vectors, and are only tractable for certain plant species. Herein, we develop a nanotube-based platform for direct delivery of siRNA, and show high silencing efficiency in intact plant cells. We demonstrate that nanotubes successfully deliver siRNA and silence endogenous genes owing to effective intracellular delivery and nanotubeinduced protection of siRNA from nuclease degradation. This study establishes that nanotubes could enable a myriad of plant biotechnology applications that rely on RNA delivery to intact cells. All rights reserved.

Agrobacterium-mediated delivery, similarly, is also limited to use in certain plant species, often yields random DNA integration that can adversely and unpredictably affect the cell operation (15) , results in constitutive expression of siRNA thus limiting temporal control over gene silencing, and can be difficult to scale or multiplex for high-throughput or multi-gene target applications, respectively (16) .
While nanomaterial-mediated delivery of RNA and therapeutics has been extensively explored in animals (17) (18) (19) , its potential for plant systems remains understudied (20) . Several prior studies take advantage of nanomaterials to deliver plasmid DNA (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) or proteins (26) to intact plant cells. Polymeric nanoparticles have shown promise for siRNA delivery to cell wall-free plant protoplasts, but polymeric nanoparticles have not been shown to traverse the cell wall for gene silencing in intact plant cells (13) . A recent study has shown that clay nanosheets can facilitate delivery of pathogen-specific double-stranded RNA into intact plant cells for virus resistance (27) .
Topical application of clay nanosheets enabled silencing of homologous RNA to provide sustained 20-day viral protection on the leaf surface. Clay nanosheet platform is a promising use of nanoparticles for delivery of RNAi into plants, paving the way towards future developments in plant bionanotechnology.

In this study, we demonstrate the delivery of a different RNAi molecule -single-stranded siRNA -into intact cells of plant leaves using high-aspect-ratio one dimensional carbon nanomaterials: singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). SWNTs are biocompatible allotropes of carbon that have a high aspect ratio cylindrical nanostructure with diameters of 0.8-1.2 nm and lengths of 500-1000 nm. SWNTs are capable of passively crossing the extracted chloroplast envelope (28) and plant cell membranes (29) due to their high aspect ratio morphology, uniquely high stiffness, and small dimensions. SWNTs are among the few nanomaterials that can be synthesized to have a smallest dimension (~ 1 nm) below the plant size exclusion limit of ~20 nm, while also providing a large cylindrical surface area from the extrusion of their 1-dimension out to ~ 500 nm. The resulting large surface area to volume ratio is thus amenable to facile loading of appreciable quantities of biological cargoes such as siRNA. In contrast, spherical nanoparticles must often exceed the plant cell wall size exclusion limit to load necessary quantities of bio-cargoes, due to the reduced scaling of the spherical nanoparticle surface area to volume. Furthermore, when bound to SWNTs, biomolecules are protected from degradation in mammalian systems (30) , exhibiting superior biostability compared to free biomolecules; a phenomenon we show herein can extend to plants. Moreover, SWNTs have strong intrinsic near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence (31, 32) within the biological tissuetransparency window and beyond the chlorophyll autofluorescence range, and thus enable tracking of cargo-nanoparticle complexes deep in plant tissues.
Prior usage of SWNTs in plant systems is limited to studies of SWNT biocompatibility (28, 33, 34) , sensing of small molecules (29, 35, 36) , and for delivery of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

To-date, there has yet to be a nanoparticle-based delivery platform for siRNA molecules into intact plant cells. Herein, we develop a SWNT-based siRNA delivery platform for the efficient silencing of an endogenous Nicotiana benthamiana gene in plant leaves. We show that SWNTs enable passive delivery (without external mechanical aid) and fluorescent-tracking of siRNA molecules in plant tissues. SWNTs present a non-toxic platform for siRNA delivery that uses a minimal siRNA dose to achieve silencing for up to 7 days, whereby silencing can be sustained upon re-infiltration of the siRNA-SWNT dose. With SWNT-mediated siRNA delivery, we achieve 95% gene silencing efficiency at the mRNA level, and show a significant delay in siRNA nuclease degradation in cells, and also at the single-molecule level, through protection by SWNTs. Taken altogether, SWNT-based delivery platform is rapid, scalable, facile to multiplex for multiple gene silencing targets, and speciesindependent (24, 33, (37) (38) (39) . In sum, this study establishes that SWNTs could be a promising resource to overcome plant RNA delivery limitations, and could enable a variety of plant biotechnology applications based on RNAi.
In this study, we aim to validate SWNTs as a passive and effective siRNA delivery and gene silencing platform for use in intact cells of mature plants. To this end, we aim to silence GFP gene expression in transgenic mGFP5 Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb) plants by delivering siRNA molecules into leaves with SWNT nanocarriers. mGFP5 Nb plants constitutively express GFP targeted to the ER under the control of the Cauliflower All rights reserved.

Herein, we tested two separate siRNA sequences (a-siRNA and b-siRNA) which target two slightly different regions of the mGFP5 gene for GFP silencing (Fig. 1a) .
Loading of siRNA on SWNTs was accomplished by probe-tip sonication of each siRNA single-strand (sense, and separately antisense) with pristine SWNTs for both a-siRNA and b-siRNA sequences (Fig. 1b) . With this method, sense and antisense strands of siRNA were non-covalently adsorbed on SWNTs via π -π stacking of RNA nitrogen bases with the π bonds of sp 2 -hybridized carbons in SWNTs. The adsorption of RNA on SWNTs was confirmed for each sequence (a-antisense-SWNT, a-sense-SWNT, b-antisense-SWNT and b-sense SWNT) through the emergence of characteristic peaks in the individually-suspended SWNT absorbance (Fig. 1c) and nIR fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 1d) . We hypothesize and later verify that upon infiltration of an equimolar mixture of sense and antisense suspended SWNTs, these complementary siRNA strands desorb from the SWNT surface and hybridize to each other inside plant cells to form the active double-stranded siRNA silencing complex.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/564427 doi: bioRxiv preprint As a negative control for all siRNA silencing studies, we used SWNTs suspended with a non-targeting scrambled RNA sequence (42) (s-RNA-SWNT, Supplementary   Table 3) , which is not complementary to the mGFP5 mRNA. Successful suspension of SWNTs with non-targeting RNA sense and antisense strands was confirmed by absorbance and fluorescence spectra of individually suspended s-RNA-SWNTs Nb leaves were imaged with confocal microscopy to quantify Cy3 fluorescence inside leaf cells and in the extracellular area. In plants, the cytosol is pushed to the cell periphery due to the presence of a large central vacuole. Leaves infiltrated with Cy3-RNA-SWNTs showed a high degree of co-localization (70% ± 8%, mean ± SD) between the intracellular (cytosolic) GFP and Cy3 fluorescence originating from the nanocarriers, which confirms efficient internalization of RNA-SWNTs into intact cells (Fig. 2b ).

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/564427 doi: bioRxiv preprint Conversely, leaves infiltrated with Cy3-RNA show minimal co-localization between the GFP and Cy3 channels (12% ± 10%, mean ± SD), and Cy3 fluorescence is observed mostly around the guard cells, suggesting free RNA is not able to internalize into intact plant cells efficiently (Fig. 2b) . Additional confocal images of Cy3-RNA-SWNT and Cy3-RNA infiltrated leaves with representative higher and lower co-localization percentages are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2 . As a note here, a typical plant cell contains an organelle called vacuole, which is filled with water and occupies 80% of the cell volume.
Therefore, any fluorescence localized in the cytoplasm follows the cytosolic cell contour shape ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).
To investigate the effect of SWNT length on the cell internalization efficiency, we prepared short SWNTs through excessive probe-tip sonication. AFM images revealed that these short SWNTs have an average length of 250 nm; they are significantly shorter than SWNTs obtained with regular preparation (776 nm). We then loaded these short SWNTs with Cy3-RNA as before and checked internalization efficiency into GFP benthamiana cells with confocal microscopy. Interestingly, we found that short SWNTs have lower plant cell internalization efficiency compared to the longer ones, shown by respective average co-localization percentages of 47% and 70% ( Supplementary Fig.   4 ).

Following 6 hours of incubation, we imaged the infiltrated leaves with a custom-built nIR microscope equipped with a Raptor Ninox VIS-SWIR 640 camera, a 721 nm SWNT excitation laser, and a white lamp and appropriate filters to image GFP (see Methods). In leaves infiltrated with ssRNA-SWNTs, commensurate with Cy3-tagged confocal imaging results, we observe a high degree of co-localization between intracellular GFP and the nIR fluorescence of SWNTs (36, 43, 44) .
After confirming that ssRNA adsorbed SWNTs can efficiently be uptaken by plant cells, we analyzed the thermodynamics of sense and antisense strand desorption from the SWNT surface, and their subsequent propensities for hybridization in the extracellular and intracellular conditions. According to our analysis (Supplementary Information), in the in vitro and extracellular area of the leaf tissue, sense and antisense strand desorption from the SWNT surface and hybridization is not thermodynamically favorable (∆G>0), due to a high free energy cost of bare SWNTs in an aqueous All rights reserved.

This unfavorable RNA desorption energy facilitates maintenance of intact RNA-SWNT conjugates in the extracellular environment until RNA-SWNTs enter cells. Once intracellular, sense and antisense strand desorption from the SWNT surface and hybridization is thermodynamically favorable (∆G<0) because intracellular proteins, lipids, and other membrane and cytosolic biomolecules can occupy the SWNT surface and lower the associated free energy costs of RNA desorption (Fig. 3b ).
Hybridization and desorption of sense and antisense RNA strands is verified with an in vitro experiment, where we mixed and incubated an equimolar mixture of a-sense-SWNT and a-antisense-SWNT suspensions for 3 h at room temperature; either in water or in plant cell lysate solution ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). We then eluted the desorbed siRNA and quantified it via absorbance at 260 nm. The results confirm that an insignificant amount of siRNA is desorbed when RNA-SWNTs incubated in water, whereas 66% of the siRNA is desorbed when incubated in plant cell lysate solution. We then ran the eluted RNA from the cell lysate sample on an agarose gel and showed that it is double-stranded, which verifies the formation of double-stranded siRNA in the cell cytosol. Additionally, zeta potential measurements of a-siRNA-SWNTs before and after hybridization in water and removal of desorbed RNA show unchanged nanoparticle zeta potential, suggesting there is not significant amount of RNA hybridizing and desorbing from SWNT surface in water ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).

Following verification of SWNT internalization and formation of active siRNA complexes in plant cells, we next infiltrated transgenic mGFP5 Nb leaves with siRNA-SWNTs and control solutions to determine the gene silencing efficiency of this platform.
Silencing studies were conducted with the following samples at 100 nM final siRNA and 2 mg/L final SWNT concentration: non-treated leaves, s-RNA-SWNT (non-targeting), free siRNA, a-siRNA-SWNT, and b-siRNA-SWNT (See Supplementary Table 3 for sequences). We have shown that 100 nM siRNA on SWNTs is an optimal dose to be used in mGFP5 silencing studies ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . Transgenic Nb leaves that constitutively express GFP were imaged via confocal microscopy to quantify GFP silencing at the protein level. Representative confocal images of the leaves 2-days postinfiltration reveals that both a-siRNA-SWNTs and b-siRNA-SWNTs lead to significant reduction of GFP in cells, whereas GFP expression in leaves infiltrated with s-RNA-SWNT and free siRNA appears similar to GFP expression in non-treated leaves (Fig.   4a ). Quantification of GFP fluorescence intensity from the confocal images of s-RNA-SWNTs and a-siRNA-SWNTs (see Methods) reveals that a-siRNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves have 38% ± 3.2% (mean ± SD) less GFP protein 3-days post-infiltration compared to the s-RNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves. At 7-days post-infiltration, a-siRNA-SWNT shows roughly the same amount of GFP, 106.6 ± 4.1% (mean ± SD), as s-RNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves (Fig. 4b) , as expected since gene silencing with siRNA is a transient process. GFP silencing with a-siRNA-SWNT was also verified with a Western blot analysis, where GFP extracted from the Nb leaves infiltrated with a-siRNA-SWNT is All rights reserved.

We corroborated the GFP reduction results obtained with confocal imaging and Western blot analysis by performing quantitative PCR (qPCR) at the mRNA transcript level. One day after infiltration of leaves with s-RNA-SWNT, free siRNA, a-siRNA-SWNT, and b-siRNA-SWNT, we extracted total RNA from the leaves and quantified the GFP mRNA transcript levels in each sample at Day 1 and 7. qPCR demonstrates that s-RNA-SWNT and free siRNA infiltrated leaves have the same amount of GFP mRNA transcript as the non-treated leaf, whereby a-siRNA-SWNT and b-siRNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves show 95% ± 4.1% (mean ± SD) and 92% ± 6.2% (mean ± SD) reduction in the GFP mRNA transcript levels at Day 1, respectively (Fig. 4d) . Similar to the confocal results, we found that mRNA transcript levels return back to the baseline levels as observed in non-treated leaves by Day 7 in all samples as a result of transient silencing (Fig. 4d) . Additionally, we show that we can recover GFP silencing at Day 7 by up to 71% ± 2.9% (mean ± SD) by re-infiltrating the leaf with second 100 nM a-siRNA-SWNT dose at Day 5 (Fig. 4e ). With the same technique, we also demonstrated the silencing of a functional endogenous Nicotiana benthamiana gene called ROQ1, which has implications in disease resistance against many pathogens (45) ( Supplementary   Fig. 8 ). Our results verify that SWNTs can also silence endogenous plant genes efficiently.

To explore this hypothesis, we performed single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF) microscopy to probe single siRNA strand susceptibility to degradation by RNase A when adsorbed on SWNTs, compared to single free siRNA. To do so, we labeled the a-antisense strand of GFP siRNA with a 5' terminal Cy3 fluorophore, and immobilized RNA-Cy3 and RNA-Cy3-SWNTs onto parallel channels of a microfluidic slide (see Methods). We measured the Cy3 fluorescence in each channel before and after treatment with RNase A, whereby percent decrease in the number of Cy3 molecules was used as a proxy for the percent siRNA degraded (Fig. 5a) . Our TIRF results show that 98% ± 0.3% (mean ± SD) of the initial Cy3-RNA immobilized on the channel surface is degraded after incubation with RNase A, whereas only 16% ± 4.9% (mean ± SD) of Cy3-RNA is degraded when it is bound to SWNTs, suggesting that SWNTs protect the siRNA cargo from enzymatic degradation inside cells (Fig. 5b) .

Intracellular stability of single stranded RNA (ssRNA) suspended SWNTs and free ssRNA was also assessed by incubating ssRNA-SWNT conjugates with total proteins extracted from plant leaves (i.e. plant cell lysate). Agarose gel electrophoresis of free ssRNA vs. ssRNA-SWNTs incubated in plant cell lysate for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours demonstrate that free ssRNA is degraded significantly faster in cells compared to ssRNA adsorbed on SWNTs (Fig. 5c) . Band intensity quantification of agarose gel reveals that upon starting with 200 ng ssRNA, free ssRNA is completely degraded within 12 hours, whereas the ssRNA on the SWNTs is only completely degraded after 24 hours (Fig. 5d and 5e) , which corresponds to a 12 hour increase in the residence time of siRNA strands in cells when delivered through SWNTs. This gives rise to prolonged and increased silencing efficiency, as siRNA strands in cells have higher chance of hybridizing into the active complex before getting degraded by plant nucleases. With a similar in vitro cell lysate degradation experiment, we also show that after hybridization and desorption, double-stranded siRNA has high stability and it persists in cells for more than 4-days after formulation ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ).
SWNT biocompatibility, at the concentrations used in this study, was tested by qPCR analysis of a commonly used stress gene, and by tissue damage analysis via confocal microscopy. For qPCR toxicity analysis, we checked the upregulation of the respiratory burst oxidase homolog B (NbrbohB) gene (Fig. 5f ). NbrbohB upregulation in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves represents stress response to many factors such as mechanical, light or heat damage (46) . qPCR results show that 2 mg/L RNA-SWNT All rights reserved.

Tissue damage in the RNA-SWNT and 1% SDS infiltrated leaves was also monitored via confocal microscopy, and no tissue or cell damage was detected in RNA-SWNT infiltrated leaves, whereas significant distortion of cell morphology and tissue integrity can be seen in the SDS treated areas (Supplementary Fig. 11 ). Given the unchanged expression levels of stress gene NbrbohB, and healthy leaf tissue of RNA-SWNT infiltrated plants, we can conclude that 2 mg/L RNA-SWNTs are biocompatible for in planta RNAi applications.

Nanomaterials have shown much promise for plasmid (24, 25) and protein (26) delivery to plants, motivating their use for plant delivery of RNAi, as has proven quite fruitful for human therapeutics. We demonstrate here that high-aspect-ratio one dimensional SWNTs can successfully deliver siRNA molecules to efficiently silence a GFP gene in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana mature plant leaves, through a combination of i) effective intracellular delivery and ii) protection of the siRNA cargo from nuclease degradation. We found that RNA adsorbed SWNTs rapidly and efficiently internalize into the full leaf thickness of mature walled plant cells within 6 hours, in contrast to free RNA internalization which is minimal. We further found that π -π adsorption of siRNA on the SWNT surface delays intracellular siRNA degradation and thus prolongs silencing.
Here, we developed a platform for siRNA delivery using nanoparticles, well suited for cellular delivery in plant tissues with intact cell walls. This platform utilizes SWNTs, to which single-stranded sense and antisense siRNA are adsorbed separately, enabling thermodynamically-favorable siRNA hybridization once intracellular for subsequent gene silencing mechanisms. We show that ssRNA is protected from degradation for up to 24 hours when adsorbed to SWNTs, whereas free ssRNA is almost completely degraded by 6 hours. We show a similar siRNA protection phenomenon with single-molecule TIRF microscopy of individual siRNA molecules either free or adsorbed to SWNTs. With this rapid and facile SWNT delivery platform, we achieve transient and DNA-free silencing of genes in mature plant leaves with a low siRNA-SWNT dose, showing mRNA knockdown efficiencies of up to 95% within 1 day post-infiltration, returning to native transcript levels by day 7. We further show that it is All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Applications that require the introduction of repeated doses of siRNA-SWNTs may cause some long-term toxicity due to the nanoparticle accumulation in cells.
However, studies should be undertaken to investigate the long-term effects of SWNT accumulation in plant cells.
The commonly used cationic nanoparticles for the delivery of negatively charged siRNA through electrostatic interactions have shown appreciable cellular toxicity to cells for certain effective concentrations and/or charge densities (47) . The pristine noncharged SWNT surface eliminates this problem and makes it possible to scale-up the delivery of siRNA for higher doses or systemic administration. Additionally, the platform could be adapted to loading multiple siRNA sequences to multiplex gene silencing targets by delivering a mixture of SWNTs suspended with multiple siRNA sequences or loading a single SWNT sample with multiple siRNA sequences. Furthermore, SWNT internalization and polynucleotide delivery into plants is hypothesized to be speciesindependent, can be used with monocots, non-model species, hard-to-transform species, and cargo-carrying SWNTs are expected to diffuse into the full thickness of leaves providing a uniform transformation profile (24) .
Given aforementioned advantages, we believe that there is a broad range of applications of our siRNA delivery platform. The process of RNA adsorption to SWNTs is based on π -π adsorption and thus agnostic to the function of the RNA cargo.

For instance, SWNTs could aid nuclease-based genome editing in plants by delivery of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and/or messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for controlled and transient nuclease expression and subsequent genome editing. Another potential application of SWNT-based RNA delivery is for increasing homology-directed repair (HDR) rates in plants for gene knock-in applications, which could possibly be achieved by suppressing the expression of the genes required for competitive nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathways (48) . As the efficient suppression of these genes is only desirable for the few-day time window in which genome editing takes place, our SWNT-mediated gene silencing platform could enable such control over transient siRNA delivery. As such, SWNT-based delivery of polynucleic acids is a useful resource to expand the plant biotechnology toolkit.

(elongation factor 1) as our housekeeping (reference) gene. Primers for these genes can be found in Supplementary Table 3 . An annealing temperature of 60˚C and 40 cycles were used for qPCR. qPCR data was analyzed by the ddCt method (51) as described in (24) . For each sample, qPCR was performed as 3 reactions from the same isolated RNA batch, and the entire experiment consisting of independent infiltrations and RNA extractions from different plants was repeated 3 times (3 biological replicates).
Single molecule TIRF to image RNA protection by SWNTs. The a-antisense siRNA strand was utilized in this assay. 10 μM 5' labelled Cy3-RNA was added to an equal mass of SWNTs. The RNA-SWNT suspension and removal of unbound RNA followed the same protocol as described in 'Quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments for gene silencing'. The positive control comprised of the same sequence that was 5' Cy3 labeled, and 3' biotin labeled. 6-channel μ-slides (ibidi, μ-Slide VI 0.5 Glass Bottom) were initially washed by pipetting 100 μL of 100 mM sterile NaCl solutions into one reservoir and removing 60 μL the other end, leaving just enough solution to fully wet the channel. Each subsequent step involved depositing the desired solution volume into the reservoir and removing the equivalent volume from the other end of the channel.

Briefly, 50 μL of 0.25 mg/mL BSA-Biotin was added to coat the surface of the glass slide for 5 minutes. Next, 50 μL of 0.05 mg/mL NeutrAvidin was added, followed by 50 μL of 1.0 mg/L RNA-SWNT, which non-specifically adsorbs to NeutrAvidin. For the positive control, 50 μL of 200 pM biotinylated Cy3-RNA was added in place of RNA-SWNT. The addition of each component comprised of a 5-minute incubation period, followed by flushing the channel with 50 μL of NaCl solution to remove specimens that were not surface-immobilized. Each channel was exposed to 50 μL of 10 μg/mL RNase A for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by rinsing the channel with 50 μL NaCl solution. Slides were imaged with a Zeiss ELYRA PS.1 microscope immediately following incubation with RNase A.
To determine if SWNT adsorbed RNA is protected from nuclease degradation, we performed an agarose gel electrophoresis based RNA protection assay as described in (24) . 200 ng free RNA and RNA-SWNTs (carrying 200 ng RNA) were each incubated with cell lysate proteins obtained from one Nb leaf to mimic the intracellular degradation conditions for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours.
After incubation in cell lysate, all RNA (intact or not) was desorbed from the SWNT surface by heating at 95˚C for 1 hour in 2% SDS and 1.5 M NaCl solution. Desorbed RNA and cell lysate treated free RNA were run on a 1% agarose gel with RNA standards (200, 100, and 50 ng) to measure the intact versus degraded RNA in each sample lane. RNA amounts on the agarose gel were quantified by using band intensity as a proxy (ImageJ Gel Analyzer) and normalized with the lanes containing known RNA quantities. All rights reserved.

Hybridized double stranded siRNA samples were incubated in nuclease-free water and cell lysate solutions at room temperature for 16, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, and solutions were run on 2% agarose gel.
Quantification of the RNA bands from the gel was done using Image J gel analyzer tool.
All band intensities were normalized with respect to the hybridized RNA band intensity at time zero without any treatment.
Plant toxicity analysis. qPCR was used to determine the expression levels of an oxidative stress gene (NbRbohB ) (46) in Nicotiana benthamiana plants treated with RNA-SWNTs and control solutions (primer sequences in Supplementary Table 3 ). The samples tested for toxicity were: buffer (0.1 M NaCl), 100 nM free siRNA, a-siRNA-SWNT, b-siRNA-SWNT (each containing 100 nM siRNA and 2 mg/L SWNT) and 1% SDS (as a positive toxicity control), and the qPCR was performed 3-hours after the infiltration of these samples. EF1 gene was used as a housekeeping gene with an annealing temperature of 60˚C for 40 cycles. Same ddCt method was used to analyze the qPCR data (24) .

infected individuals is beneficial and should be encouraged, it challenges data analysts because 47
it is time-varying and reflects dynamic and often unpredictable human behavior. Moreover, the 48 rate at which infected individuals are removed from the population typically accelerates 49 throughout an epidemic as awareness of the infectious threat increases, 8 a process Drake et al 50 referred to as ""societal learning."" 9 Obtaining accurate estimates of this time-varying removal of 51
infected persons, while difficult, improves the quality of compartmental models for epidemics 52 of infectious disease. 9,10 To our knowledge, however, no work has directly compared the rate of 53 behavioral adaption across multiple epidemics, societies, and geographic settings. 54 55
Many factors can affect how quickly effective isolation practices are implemented, such as 56 access to health care, local public health funding, international aid, and the efficacy of 57 information campaigns. 11 Local health care practices and non-formal healthcare systems also 58 provide care to patients during epidemics and can play a part in quarantining infected 59
individuals. 12 Previous work in Liberia has shown that a combination of these approaches 60 through simultaneous community engagement and clinical intervention is more effective than 61
any single intervention, with both health care access and utilization increasing hand-in-hand to 62
decrease EVD transmission during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic. 13 While infection prevention 63
often includes vaccination, progress to develop effective vaccines for emerging infections is 64 slow and not necessarily more effective than isolation of infected individuals. 14 Ring vaccination 65
with the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP Ebola vaccine 15 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is 66
promising, 16 but previous work has suggested that ring vaccination may only provide a marginal 67 benefit to rigorous contact tracing and patient isolation. 17 68 69
The focus of this paper is the identification of key similarities and differences in the behavioral 70 response to outbreaks of three emerging zoonotic infections. We sought to determine how the 71 mean removal rate of infected individuals changed over the course of each outbreak as 72 measured by epidemic week and viral serial interval. Individuals often experience zoonotic and 73 emerging infections as innately more frightening than ""familiar"" diseases, leading to rapid 74 behavioral adaptations due to high perceived risk. 18 We compiled data for each outbreak location binned by epidemic week, to produce comparable 97 data for regression analysis. Epidemic weeks came from weekly onset dates described above. 98
We also binned the same data by serial interval, using 12 days as the estimated serial interval 99
for Ebola, 23 8 days for SARS, 24 and 7 days for MERS; 27 this was calculated as epidemic 100
week/(serial interval/7). Each dataset included, per week, the number of new cases, the 101 cumulative number of cases, mean DSOH and associated standard deviation, and MRR and 102 associated standard deviation. We removed epidemic weeks from the beginning of each 103 outbreak so that the first three epidemic weeks had greater than 0 cases of disease each in 104 order to focus on population-level behavioral adaptation to large-scale disease outbreaks 105
instead of adaptations to individual disease events early in an epidemic. We performed all 106 regression analyses using this binned data. 107 108
Initial regression analyses fit linear models to predict DSOH and MRR ( week) more than the 165 mean change in the 166 MRR of the Liberian 167
Ebola epidemic (Fig.  168 2). The mean change 169 of the MRR in the 170
Ebola epidemic in Lofa 171
County, Liberia, was 172 significantly higher than the mean change of the MRR for the overall Liberian epidemic and the 173 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The three MERS outbreaks (Riyadh, Jeddah, and South Korea) did not differ 175 significantly from one another and had limited precision (Fig. 2) . 176 177
We narrowed the 195 associated confidence intervals (Fig. 2) . We identified little difference in the mean change of 196 the MRR for the Ebola outbreak depending on predictor (Fig. 2) While our findings demonstrate large and statistically significant differences in MRR, it is 231
notable that the calculated rates of change in the MRRs are within a factor of ten (when 232 calculated using epidemic week) to seven (when calculated using serial interval) of each other 233 (Fig. 2) , with the mean change being the lowest in the EVD outbreak in Liberia and the highest 234
in the MERS outbreak in South Korea. For modelers seeking to understand the epidemiology of 235 emerging infectious diseases with limited or no data from previous outbreaks, this study 236 provides a range of acceptable values for the MRR based on seven geographically distinct 237 outbreaks of three emerging diseases. Similarly, while large disparities in DSOH are obvious (Fig.  238 1), these data highlight that all societies quickly adapt to outbreaks of emerging infections. We have shown that public health practices for isolating infected individuals from the 249 susceptible population vary significantly by pathogen and location, but can in some cases be 250 predicted by the timing and serial interval of the epidemic. This study detected variation in 251 DSOH and MRR based on epidemic location and outbreak type, indicating that it may be 252 possible to estimate a general range of the rate of change in these variables over time. Due to 253
location-specific differences in DSOH and MRR, modelers who seek to develop forecasts early in 254 an outbreak would benefit from estimating an expected range for removal of infected 255 individuals using data from past outbreaks of the same pathogen in a similar setting. 256
Furthermore, the quality of these estimates will be impacted by the metric chosen, as seen by 257 the notable, but distinct, trends detected in DSOH and MRR. As seen in this study, utilizing a 258
well-chosen response variable with a relatively small amount of data can provide material for 259
making effective forecasts about public health behavior. ",Protective Population Behavior Change in Outbreaks of Emerging Infectious Disease 1 2,biorxiv,10.1101/2020.01.27.921536,,,biorxiv,2020-01-28,"Lodge, E. K.; Schatz, A. M.; Drake, J. M.",,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv
03ce432f27c7df6af22b92245a614db2ecb5de5f,"Human astroviruses are small nonenveloped viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that contain three main open reading frames: ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. Astroviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide and have been associated with encephalitis and meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Through comparative genomic analysis of >400 astrovirus sequences, we identified a conserved ""ORFX"" overlapping the capsid-encoding ORF2 in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses. ORFX appears to be subject to purifying selection, consistent with it encoding a functional protein product, termed XP. Using ribosome profiling of cells infected with human astrovirus 1, we confirm initiation at the ORFX AUG.
XP-knockout astroviruses are strongly attenuated and after passaging can partly restore viral titer via pseudo-reversions, thus demonstrating that XP plays an important role in virus growth.
To further investigate XP, we developed an astrovirus replicon system. We demonstrate that XP has only minor effects on RNA replication and structural protein production. Instead, XP associates with the plasma membrane with an extracellular N-terminus topology and promotes efficient virus release. Using two different assays, we show that expression of human or related astrovirus XPs leads to cell permeabilization, suggesting a viroporin-like activity. The discovery of XP advances our knowledge of these important human viruses and opens a new direction of research into astrovirus replication and pathogenesis.
They are considered to be the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in infants after rotavirus 1 . Recently, and especially in immunocompromised individuals, astroviruses have also .

Despite their undoubted importance, astroviruses still represent one of the least studied groups of human positive-sense RNA viruses. The genome contains three main open reading frames:
ORF1a encoding a nonstructural polyprotein (nsP1a), ORF1b encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF2 encoding the capsid protein (CP) (Fig. 1A) 3 . ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the genomic RNA (gRNA), with expression of ORF1b depending on programmed ribosomal frameshifting whereby a proportion of ribosomes translating ORF1a make a −1 nucleotide shift into ORF1b. Frameshifting occurs at a conserved A_AAA_AAC sequence within the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region and depends on a 3′-adjacent stimulatory RNA stem-loop structure 4 . ORF2 is translated from a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) that is produced during virus infection.
Previously, using comparative genomics we identified a conserved fourth ORF (ORFX) in genogroup I astroviruses, which appears to be subject to purifying selection and therefore is likely to encode a functional protein product, termed the X protein (XP, 12 kDa, 112 aa) 5 .
ORFX overlaps the 5′ region of the capsid-encoding ORF2 and is predicted to be translatable via ribosomal leaky scanning, which is expected to be enhanced by the very short leader on the sgRNA 3,6,7 . However, despite the comparative genomic predictions, the existence, relevance, and function of XP have never been demonstrated. Here we perform a functional molecular dissection of ORFX, providing insight into the simultaneous orchestration of several overlapping functional elements in a small human-pathogenic RNA virus. We show that ORFX is translated during virus infection, XP knockout mutant viruses are highly attenuated, and XP is a transmembrane (TM) protein that promotes efficient virus release via a viroporin-like activity. Through an extended bioinformatic analysis, we predict that related XP proteins are widely encoded in other mammalian astroviruses including the divergent ""MLB"" group of human-infecting astroviruses.
Comparative genomic analysis reveals a potential ORFX in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses.
Since there are many more astrovirus sequences available now than in 2010, we began by repeating our previous comparative genomic analysis but this time also extending to other astrovirus genogroups. All mammalian astrovirus complete or nearly complete genome sequences were obtained from the","Humans astroviruses (HAstVs) belong to genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae.
ORF1b (RdRp) amino acid sequences were extracted and aligned, and a phylogenetic tree constructed (Fig. S1 ). We follow the genogroups defined in Yokoyama et al. 8 . Although the more-divergent CP sequences may provide a less robust phylogenetic analysis, we also constructed a CP-based phylogenetic tree to test for possible recombination (Fig. S2 ). At the level of genogroup the ORF1b and CP trees were consistent, although within genogroups there were some differences between the topologies of the two trees. For simplicity, we used the ORF1b tree to define astrovirus clades for full-genome analyses.
We grouped astrovirus sequences into clades (Fig. 1B) , generated codon-based alignments of concatenated ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2 coding sequences within each clade, and analyzed the alignments with synplot2 which tests for regions where synonymous substitutions occur less often than average for the sequence alignment 9 . Regions with significantly enhanced synonymous site conservation typically harbour overlapping functional elements which constraint sequence evolution 9 . The analysis of subgroup ""Ia"" astroviruses ( Fig. 1B ; classical HAstVs besides some feline and sea lion astroviruses) revealed conserved elements at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b (representing the ribosomal frameshifting signal and ORF1a/ORF1b overlap), upstream of ORF2 (presumed to represent elements involved in sgRNA synthesis), towards the 3′ end of ORF2 (possible replication elements), and overlapping the 5′ end of ORF2 (the putative overlapping ORFX) (Fig. 1C) . We applied the same analysis to 13 other astrovirus genogroup or sub-genogroup clades, revealing conserved regions overlapping the 5′ end of ORF2 in genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses but, generally (see below for exceptions), not in genogroup II or VI astroviruses (Fig. S3) .
We repeated the synonymous site conservation analysis using clades, sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees based on only ORF2 in order to rule out potential artefacts as a result of possible recombination between the nonstructural and structural modules of the virus genome, and to include additional part-genome sequences (total 415 sequences with ORF2 coverage; Fig. 1D; Fig. S4 ). This analysis revealed conserved regions overlapping the 5′ end of ORF2 throughout genogroup I, III and IV astroviruses but, generally, not in genogroup II or VI astroviruses (Fig. S5 ). Those clades with synonymous site conservation also contain a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF, whereas those sequences without synonymous site conservation generally also lacked a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF (Fig. S5) .
Interestingly, we also detected synonymous site conservation in two subgroups of genogroup II astroviruses ( Fig. S3G; Fig. S3H ). In subgroup ""IId"", the conservation coincided with a conserved overlapping +1 frame ORF (Fig. S5E) ; however in subgroup ""IIc"", there was no conserved ORF in the +1 reading frame. Instead, we observed an ORF in the −1 reading frame . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint with no AUG codon (ORFY, Fig. S5D ) but with conserved signals for −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting 10 , namely a conserved A_AAA_AAZ (Z = A, C or U) slippery heptanucleotide and a 3′-adjacent RNA stem-loop (or pseudoknot structure) (Fig. S6 ). It seems plausible that ORFX and ORFY in genogroup II astroviruses may have evolved independently of ORFX in other astrovirus genogroups (see Discussion).
Evidence for ORFX was also found in a clade of rodent astroviruses of unassigned genogroup ( Fig. S3D; Fig. S5L ). Further, a number of unclustered divergent sequences also contain long +1 frame ORFs overlapping the 5′ end of ORF2 that potentially encode XP proteins (Fig. S7 ).
Note that genogroup V -represented by a single partial sequence, FJ890355 (bottlenose dolphin astrovirus 1) -is one of these. Table S1 ). Similar to other overlapping genes, which generally evolve de novo 11 , the XP peptide sequences show little to no homology to known protein domains. Many XP sequences contain a predicted TM domain, and some other XPs contain a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that resembles a TM domain despite being scored below threshold by Phobius (Fig. S8, Fig. S9 ).
To test for XP expression in infected cells, we first raised various antibodies against XP peptides and we also tested the viability of tagged-XP viruses. However, neither antibody nor tagged virus approaches were successful. Thus we turned to ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq). Ribo-Seq is a high throughput sequencing technique that globally maps the footprints of initiating or elongating 80S ribosomes on mRNAs 12, 13 . We infected Caco2 cells and performed Ribo-Seq at 12 hours post infection (hpi). Ribo-Seq quality was assessed as previously described 14 (Fig.   S10 ). Using flash-freezing with no drug pre-treatment (NT), we mapped the translational landscape of the HAstV1 genome ( Fig. 2A) . ORF2 is translated at ~9 the level of ORF1a, whereas ORF1b is translated at ~25% the level of ORF1a, indicating a ribosomal frameshifting efficiency of ~25%. The higher expression of ORF2 is likely a result of higher levels of sgRNA than gRNA in the translation pool. To identify translation initiation sites, we utilized the translation inhibitor lactimidomycin (LTM), which acts preferentially on the initiating ribosome but not on the elongating ribosome 15 . LTM binds to the 80S ribosome already assembled at the initiation codon and occupies the empty exit (E-site) of initiating ribosomes, thus completely blocking translocation. Using this approach, we confirm the two previously known initiation . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

It is worth noting that the short leader of the sgRNA may result in protection by the ribosome of the 5′ end of ORF2 initiation footprints from the RNase I nuclease, so that many or most ORF2 initiation footprints might retain the viral VPg protein that is thought to be covalently linked to the 5′ end of genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Such reads will not ligate to the adapter oligonucleotides and thus will be excluded from sequencing. This may explain why the ORF2 initiation peak is smaller than the ORF1a initiation peak, even though ORF2 is expressed at much higher levels than ORF1a. Thus we cannot quantify the ORF2:ORFX expression ratio from the LTM data.
Ribosome profiling of eukaryotic systems typically has the characteristic that mappings of the 5′ end positions of ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) to coding sequences reflect the triplet periodicity (herein referred to as ""phasing"") of genetic decoding. For our datasets, the great majority of RPF 5′ ends map to the first nucleotide of codons (Fig. 2C, left) . Reads mapping to the ORF2/ORFX part of the genome (NT samples) were quantified in the three possible phases.
In the region of ORF2 that is overlapped by ORFX we observed an increased number of reads mapping in the +1 phase relative to the ORF2 reading frame (Fig. 2C , middle) compared to the region of ORF2 that is not overlapped by ORFX (Fig. 2C , right) or the coding regions of host mRNAs (Fig. 2C, left) . Quantification of the differences in phasing indicated that ORFX is translated at ~27% of the level of ORF2, although it should be noted that reporter assays (see below) are expected to provide more accurate quantification than RPF phasing analysis.
XP-knockout viruses are attenuated but pseudo-revert on passage.
To evaluate the significance of ORFX in the context of virus infection, a set of mutant virus genomes was created based on the pAVIC1 infectious clone 16 by introducing mutations that knock out ORFX without affecting the CP amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A) . Four independent mutations were introduced to guard against the possibility of affecting potential RNA secondary structures overlapping with this region, resulting in pAVIC1-AUGm (AUG to ACG), pAVIC1-PTC1 (stop codon after 20 amino acids), pAVIC1-2×PTC (double stop codon after 20 amino acids) and pAVIC1-PTC2 (stop codon after 73 amino acids) ( Fig. 3B; Fig. S11 ). Corresponding T7 RNA transcripts were used for virus rescue in Huh7.5.1 cells followed by infection in Caco2 cells. All four ORFX knockout viruses were strongly attenuated compared to wt virus (Fig. 3C ).
After seven blind passages in Caco2 cells, two mutant viruses (pAVIC1-AUGm and pAVIC1-. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint PTC1) demonstrated an 1 log increase in virus titers, which was achieved via a pseudoreversion (pAVIC1-AUGm) or 5 or 8 codon deletions (pAVIC1-PTC1) (Fig. 3C ). All three mutations would result in restoration of XP expression, confirming its importance in virus growth.
XP is essential for virus release but has only a minor effect on RNA replication.
ORFX overlaps ORF2, which encodes the structural polyprotein, and therefore the expression of XP is likely required in late stages of the virus replication cycle. To rule out the possibility of XP directly influencing viral RNA replication, we developed a replicon system comprising an intact astrovirus genome up to the end of ORFX, followed by a 2A-RLuc cassette fused in either the ORF2 or ORFX reading frame, followed by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig. 4A) . These replicons provide a direct measurement of translated product associated with activity of the subgenomic promoter. Two ORFX knock-out mutations were copied in both versions of the replicon to evaluate the significance of XP for RNA replication (Fig. 4B ). Experiments were performed in BSR and Huh7.5.1 cell lines, both of which have been reported to support astrovirus replication 16, 17 . Replication was confirmed by an 1200-2100 fold difference in relative luciferase activity between wt and an RdRp knockout mutant (GDD → GNN) at 9 and 12 hours post transfection (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). The mutations introduced to knock out ORFX had minor effect on luciferase activity when 2A-RLuc was fused in the ORF2 reading frame (Fig. 4C, Fig. S12A ). Consistent with our Ribo-Seq results (Fig.   2C ), luciferase activity for the ORFX reading frame was 14% (BSR cells; Fig. 4C ) and 21% (Huh7.5.1 cells; Fig. S12A ) of luciferase activity for the ORF2 reading frame. Thus, ORFX is efficiently translated but has only a minor (if any) direct effect on viral RNA replication.
As expected, both XP knockout mutations resulted in a substantial drop in ORFX-frame luciferase activity (Fig. 4D, Fig. S12B ). This drop was more pronounced for the PTC mutant (5.5±0.7% wt in BSR cells and 4.1±1.7% in Huh7.5.1 cells) than for the AUGm mutant (AUG to ACG; 17.9±0.1% wt in BSR cells and 13.2±0.3% in Huh7.5.1 cells). ACG codons are known to permit initiation when in a strong initiation context (e.g. A at −3 and G at +4 as in the AUGm mutant) 18 . Since we wished to only use mutations that were synonymous in ORF2, we were unable to mutate the ORFX AUG codon in any other way. When utilized as an initiation codon, ACG is expected to be decoded as methionine by initiator Met-tRNA. Therefore the AUGm mutant is still expected to produce wt XP, albeit at a greatly reduced level.

The astrovirus subgenomic promoter is also situated within this region of the astrovirus genome ( Fig. 4A ). Although effective replication occurred even in the absence of XP translation (Fig.   4C ), the introduced mutations could still have a potential effect on sgRNA production via alteration of RNA structure and/or other interactions. To map the minimal region required for wt levels of sgRNA production in the context of the pO2RL replicon, we gradually truncated the sequence between the start of ORF2 and ORFX. Surprisingly, we found that a replicon containing only the first 4 or 28 nucleotides of ORF2 has very poor subgenomic reporter activity (0.6±0.03 and 12.5±0.1% that of wt pO2RL, respectively). In contrast, including the first 46 nucleotides of ORF2 restored subgenomic reporter activity to 92% of wt (Fig. 4F , S12C). These data suggest that the astrovirus subgenomic promoter is significantly longer than previously reported 19 and extends into the 5′ part ORF2, but does not appear to extend into ORFX.
To determine which stage of the virus replication cycle is affected in XP knock-out viruses, we quantified released virus and viral protein and RNA levels for BSR cells electroporated with in vitro transcribed full-length pAVIC1 T7 RNAs. As expected, neither RNA nor protein levels were affected in cell-derived samples (Fig. 4G ). In contrast, in media-derived samples, XP mutant titers were significantly below wt titers when analyzed by qRT-PCR (fold differences = 0.08 and 0.05, p = 0.002 and 0.003 for AUG vs wt and PTC vs wt respectively; 2-tailed t-tests with separate variances) or virus titration (Fig. 4G ). These analyses indicate the involvement of XP late in the virus replication cycle, with XP potentially acting in either virus assembly or virus release. Since previous structural studies on the HAstV CP 20 and virion 21 have not indicated the presence of any additional proteins in the compact 43-nm virion structure, the more likely role for XP is in virus release.
XP localizes to plasma membrane and perinuclear membranes with an extracellular Nterminus topology.
To further investigate the function of XP, we studied its intracellular localization. To make the small XP protein more stable and enable visualization in transfected cells, we fused it either Nor C-terminally with mCherry in the context of a mammalian expression vector. The diffuse cytoplasmic localization of mCherry was drastically affected in both fusions, where it was relocalized to plasma and perinuclear membranes (Fig. 5A ). This strongly suggests the presence of a membrane-interacting domain in XP, which was not predicted by TM domain prediction software ( Fig. S8 ; see Methods). Since ORFX is completely embedded within ORF2, it may have greatly decreased evolutionary flexibility, perhaps resulting in the evolution of a non-. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Some of the putative XP proteins encoded by other astroviruses do in fact have predicted TM regions (Fig. S9 ). We also confirmed membrane and nuclear association of the XP-fused mCherry proteins by subcellular fractionation of transfected HeLa cells and subsequent analysis of the fractions (Fig. 5B ). To investigate the potential topology of XP within the plasma membrane, we probed live electroporated HeLa cells with anti-mCherry antibody, fixed the cells and analyzed them by confocal microscopy. We observed punctate staining across the plasma membrane when mCherry was fused to the N-terminus but not when it was fused to the C-terminus, suggesting an extracellular N-terminal topology and potential multimerization ( Fig. 5C-D) .
XPs from HAstV1 and related astroviruses have a viroporin-like activity.
Given the above results, we hypothesized a possible viroporin function for XP. Viroporins are virus-encoded ion channel proteins which disturb membrane integrity leading to permeabilization. Given the C-terminal below-threshold TM predictions for HAstV XPs (Fig.   S8 ), we hypothesized that the C-terminal region might harbour a TM pore-forming domain.
Additional support came from Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity profiles (Fig. 6B ) and a Cterminal α-helical structure prediction for HAstV1-8 XPs (Fig. S14) . A helical wheel representation of this region revealed a penta-leucine hydrophobic face in HAstV1 (Fig. 6A ).
Although these leucines are not entirely conserved between the eight HAstV serotypes (Fig.   1F ), each XP was still predicted to contain an amphipathic α-helix in this region 22 . To test for viroporin-like activity, we utilized a previously described Sindbis virus replicon (SINV repC) 23 to overexpress XP or control proteins in mammalian cells. This replicon has been demonstrated to be an extremely useful tool for investigating viroporins from different RNA viruses via induced permeabilization of the plasma membrane in BHK cells to the translation inhibitor hygromycin B (HB). BSR cells (a clone of BHK cells) were electroporated with in vitro transcribed SINV repC RNAs, and new protein synthesis was labelled with Lazidohomoalanine (AHA) in the presence or absence of HB, followed by lysis and click chemistry-based on-gel detection 24 . Expression of XP or Strep-tagged enterovirus 2B (a wellcharacterized viroporin 25 ) led to almost total inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 6C-D) indicating that both proteins induced pronounced cell permeabilization to HB.
Another widely used assay to assess the ability of proteins to permeabilize cellular membranes is based on impaired growth of Escherichia coli upon induced overexpression of a membranepermeabilizing protein 26, 27 . Consistent with the results observed in the mammalian system, . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

There are two features that are generally associated with viroporin membrane permeabilizing activity: (i) an amphipathic α-helix that facilitates oligomerization to form the TM pore, and (ii) adjacent positively charged residues that anchor the viroporin in the membrane 27, 28 . To test for these features in XP, two conserved RR motifs present in all eight HAstV serotypes (Fig. 1F ) were mutated to alanines (Fig. 6F) . Interestingly, only the mutation of the very C-terminal arginines resulted in loss of XP activity in this system (Fig.   6G ). Mutation of the hydrophobic leucine stretch (L95, L98, L102, L105 and L109, Fig. 6A ) to serines and threonines (Fig. 6F ) also resulted in complete loss of XP activity (Fig. 6G) . Thus, the C-terminal domain of XP is involved in membrane permeabilization and harbours key features of a viroporin.
To investigate conservation of XP activity across different astrovirus species, we tested several other astrovirus XPs in the bacterial lysis assay. We used XPs from closely related HAstV4, feline (FAstV; genotype Ia), canine (CAstV; genotype Ib) and distantly related porcine (PAstV4; genotype IIIc) astroviruses in this experiment (Fig. 6H ). Protein expression constructs were created to express XPs with N-or C-terminal Strep tags, and combinations resulting in detectable protein were chosen for the assay. Induction of each of the four XPs resulted in strong inhibition of bacterial growth (Fig. 6I) , with XP expression confirmed by western blot (Fig. 6J ).
Similar to HAstV XPs, all tested proteins contain one or two predicted amphipathic α-helices ( Fig. S15) . Thus, these findings indicate that this newly identified astrovirus protein has a membrane-permeabilizing function.
The data presented here demonstrate the existence of an additional protein, XP, encoded within the human astrovirus genome. XP is important for virus growth, localizes to the plasma membrane, and plays a role in virus release. Viroporins have been reported for many enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and -although they can play roles in virus entry and modulation of cellular pathways -most often they facilitate virus assembly or release 26 . However, no viroporin candidate had been previously predicted for astroviruses. Identifying a viroporin is challenging due to the lack of homology among viroporins from different viruses. Viroporins are typically small hydrophobic integral membrane proteins of around 100 aa in size, with two motifs -an amphipathic α-helix and an adjacent cluster of positively charged residues; mutation of these residues generally abolishes viroporin activity 27 . Using two different assays and . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint computational approaches, we show that XP fulfils these criteria. XP is capable of permeabilizing cellular membranes and has a distinct N-terminal extracellular topology with one TM domain, thus making XP a candidate class IA viroporin, a class which also includes the influenza A virus M2, coronavirus E and HIV-1 Vpu proteins 26, 28 . Future work will be needed to confirm potential ion channel activity, and characterize ion specificity, structural organisation, and processes affected by XP expression in the context of viral infection. The localization of XP not only at the plasma membrane but also in the perinuclear region raises the possibility that XP may also have additional functions. Whereas the C-terminal α-helix appears to be associated with the cell-permeabilizing activity, additional functions (if any) of the extended N-terminal domain of XP remain to be studied.
Comparative genomic analysis suggests that the presence of a protein-coding ORF overlapping ORF2 is widespread in mammalian astroviruses. It appears to be almost ubiquitous in genogroups I, III and IV and is probably present in the single genogroup V sequence. It also appears to be present in various unassigned sequences and clades. ORFX frequently has a hydrophobic stretch that is often predicted to be a TM domain and in other cases may represent a non-canonical TM domain refractory to detection with standard TM-predicting software (as appears to be the case for HAstV1). While normally absent from genogroup II astroviruses, an ORFX appears to be present in one clade (herein referred to as IId), whereas in the clade referred to herein as IIc we predicted an ORFY in the −1 instead of +1 frame, and accessed via ribosomal frameshifting instead of leaky scanning. Given the sporadic appearance of an overlapping ORF across the genogroup II phylogeny, it seems likely that the genogroup II ORFX and ORFY evolved independently from ORFX in genogroups I, III and IV, and may also therefore have different functions. In contrast, these other ORFXs may or may not have a common ancestor and/or common function (it is unclear to what extent genogroups I, III and IV form a monophyletic group; Fig. S1, Fig. S2 ). The N-terminal ~70 aa of CP are dispensable for particle assembly and likely structurally disordered 20 and may therefore be evolutionarily fairly flexible. Thus, this region of ORF2 may be unusually tolerant to the coding constraints imposed by overlapping genes. Together with the high translation level of sgRNAs at later timepoints ( Fig. 2A) , and the ease with which 5′ proximal ORFs can be expressed (requiring only leaky scanning rather than more complex expression mechanisms such as internal ribosome entry or ribosomal frameshifting 10 ), the 5′ region of the sgRNA may be particularly well-suited to the evolution of an overlapping gene, consistent with multiple independent origins of ORFXs.
During this study we also developed and characterized the first astrovirus replicon system. This will be of broad utility to the astrovirus research community. Astroviruses are one of the major .

Nonetheless, despite their ubiquity and importance, astroviruses represent some of the least well-studied human viruses, partly because it has been difficult to establish efficient lab systems to study them. The replicon system developed herein will now permit detailed characterization of astrovirus replication and gene expression, and facilitate research into antiviral drugs.
In summary, using comparative genomic analyses we predicted a new gene in the Mamastrovirus genus; using ribosome profiling we demonstrated XP expression in HAstV1infected cells; and using a range of techniques we demonstrated the crucial role of XP in virus growth by promoting virus release, which is likely associated with its membranepermeabilizing activity. These findings add a new dimension to astrovirus molecular biology, with potential impacts for new therapeutics (e.g. compounds that block XP activity) and vaccine development (e.g. by inhibiting XP expression).
Mammalian astrovirus nucleotide sequences were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on 26 July 2018. Patent sequence records and sequences with ≥20 ambiguous nucleotide codes (e.g. ""N""s) were removed. For the full-genome analyses, only sequences covering all or nearly all of ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 were retained, giving 221 sequences (listed in Fig. S1 ). For the ORF2 analyses, only sequences covering all or nearly all of ORF2 were retained, giving 415 sequences (listed in Supplementary Dataset 1) . To identify the correct 5′ end of ORF1b, we identified the AAAAAAC frameshift site. To identify the correct initiation site of ORF2, we identified the highly conserved sgRNA promoter nucleotides 29 and selected the next ORF2-frame AUG codon as the ORF2 start site in representative reference sequences; for the other sequences, the ORF2 start site was identified by amino acid alignment to one of the reference sequences. ORF1b and ORF2 sequences were extracted, translated to amino acid sequences, aligned with MUSCLE 30 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/661579 doi: bioRxiv preprint acid rate matrices, with 1,000,000 (221-sequence trees; Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 ) or 5,000,000 (415sequence tree; Fig. S4 ) generations, discarding the first 25% as burn-in (other parameters were left at defaults). Trees were visualized with FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
The 221-sequence ORF1b tree was used to manually select clades (Fig. 1B) for full-genome SYNPLOT2 analyses (Fig. S3) . For the ORF2-only SYNPLOT2 analyses (Fig. S5) , we used a more objective method to select clades. Through an iterative procedure of clustering the 415 ORF2 sequences based on amino acid identity to a set of reference sequences, and selecting sequences distal from all reference sequences as new reference sequences, we arrived at a set identity to a reference, and only 20 have <55% identity; 82 and 4 sequences have >50% and >55% identity, respectively, to >1 references. Each non-reference sequence was then clustered with the reference sequence to which it has highest CP amino acid identity. This resulted in 16 singleton clusters and 26 multi-sequence clusters.
Synonymous site conservation was analyzed with SYNPLOT2 9 . For the full-genome analyses we generated codon-respecting alignments using a procedure described previously 9 . In brief, each individual genome sequence was aligned to a reference sequence using code2aln version 1.2 32 . Genomes were then mapped to reference sequence coordinates by removing alignment positions that contained a gap character in the reference sequence, and these pairwise alignments were combined to give the multiple sequence alignment. To assess conservation at synonymous sites, the ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 coding regions were extracted from the alignment (with codons selected from the longer ORF in each overlap region), concatenated inframe, and the alignment analyzed with SYNPLOT2 using a 25-codon sliding window.
Conservation statistics were then mapped back to reference genome coordinates for plotting.
For the ORF2-only SYNPLOT2 analyses, any duplicate sequences were removed and the remaining ORF2 sequences in each clade were translated, aligned using MUSCLE as amino acid sequences, back-translated to codon-respecting nucleotide alignments, and the alignment analyzed with SYNPLOT2 as above. In contrast to the full-genome alignments, all alignment gaps were retained instead of mapping to a specific reference sequence coordinate system.

The XP proteins of HAstVs 1-8 were additionally queried with TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/; weak TM prediction for HAstV3, no TM predicted for other HAstVs) and SOSUI (http://harrier.nagahama-ibio.ac.jp/sosui/sosui_submit.html; no TMs predicted). XP secondary structures were predicted with RaptorX 35 . To search for potential homologues of XP, XPs from Fig. S6D, Fig. S7 and The infectious clone of HAstV1 (pAVIC1, GenBank accession number L23513.1) was described previously 16 . The reverse genetics procedure was compiled from several previously published approaches 16, 17 . Initial virus was recovered from T7 transcribed RNA using reverse transfection of Huh7.5.1 cells by Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen) (for virus rescue, see Fig. 3) or electroporation of BSR cells in PBS at 800 V and 25 µF using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell TM electroporation system (see Fig. 4 for an analysis of virus RNA in cells versus released particles). For virus passaging, the collected supernatant was treated with 10 µg/ml trypsin (Type IX, Sigma, #T0303) for 30 min at 37 °C, diluted 5 times with serum-free media, and used for infection of Caco2 cells. After 3 h of incubation, the virus containing media was replaced with serum free media containing 0.6 µg/ml trypsin, and cells were incubated for 48-72 h until appearance of CPE. After 3 freeze-thaw cycles, the viral stocks were aliquoted, frozen and stored at −70 °C. Viral stocks were titrated as previously described 35 , but using infrared detection readout, combined with automated LI-COR software-based quantification. 
For mammalian expression of XP, the coding sequence of mCherry alone or HAstV1 XP fused to mCherry at either the N-or C-terminus was inserted into vector pCAG-PM 36 using AflII and PacI restriction sites. The resulting constructs -designated pCAG-mCherry, pCAG-XP-mCherry, and pCAG-mCherry-XP -were confirmed by sequencing.
All virus genome mutations (Fig. S11) were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis of pAVIC1 and confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized with XhoI prior to T7 RNA transcription. To create the HAstV1 replicon system, the pAVIC1 infectious clone was left intact up to the end of ORFX, then followed by a foot and mouth disease virus 2A sequence and a Renilla luciferase (RLuc) sequence fused in either the ORF2 (pO2RL) or ORFX (pXRL) reading frame, followed by the last 624 nt of the virus genome and a poly-A tail (Fig.   4A ). All mutations were introduced from the corresponding pAVIC1 mutants using available restriction sites and all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The resulting plasmids were linearized with XhoI prior to T7 RNA transcription. Each XP coding sequence was inserted into the pOPT plasmid with a C-or N-terminal Streptag as indicated (Fig. 6I) .

Ribo-Seq analysis was performed as described previously 14 . Adaptor sequences were trimmed using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit) and trimmed reads shorter than 25 nt were discarded. Reads were mapped to host (Homo sapiens) and virus RNA using bowtie version 1 39 , with parameters -v 2 --best (i.e. maximum 2 mismatches, report best match).
Mapping was performed in the following order: host rRNA, virus RNA, host RefSeq mRNA, host non-coding RNA, host genome.
To normalize for library size, reads per million mapped reads (RPM) values were calculated using the sum of positive-sense virus and host RefSeq mRNA reads as the denominator. A +12 nt offset was applied to the RPF 5′ end positions to give the approximate ribosomal P-site positions. To calculate the phasing and length distributions of host and virus RPFs, only RPFs whose 5′ end (+12 nt offset) mapped between the 13th nucleotide from the beginning and the 18th nucleotide from the end of coding sequences (ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 for HAstV;
RefSeq mRNAs for host) were counted, thus avoiding RPFs near initiation and termination sites. For Fig. S10 , the dual-coding region where ORFX overlaps ORF2 was also excluded.
Histograms of host RPF positions (5′ end +12 nt offset) relative to initiation and termination sites were derived from RPFs mapping to RefSeq mRNAs with annotated coding regions ≥450 nt in length and with annotated 5′ and 3′ UTRs ≥60 nt in length. Virus ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 ribosome densities (used herein as a proxy for translation levels) were calculated by counting RPFs whose 5′ end (+12 nt offset) mapped within the regions 101-2782, 2866-4311 .

To compare phasing in the region of ORF2 overlapped by ORFX with the region of ORF2 not overlapped by ORFX (Fig. 2C) we counted RPFs whose 5′ end (+12 nt offset) mapped within the regions 4388-4693 or 4727-6673, respectively.

For RT-qPCR analysis, a 150 µl aliquot of each sample was mixed with 4 × 10 6 Lysates from the above mentioned assays were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, using standard 12% SDS-PAGE to resolve mCherry and its XP-fusion variants, and precast Novex™ 10-20% tricine protein gels (Thermo Fisher) to resolve XPs and enterovirus 2B.

A custom rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against XP peptide SNSGNRVSQDQNLQ (GenScript; only able to detect strongly overexpressed XP) and an anti-Strep mouse antibody (Abcam, ab184224) were used for detecting HAstV1 XP and Strep-tagged proteins, respectively.

No reuse allowed without permission.","Frameshifting is a fundamental biological process in which a ribosome translating an RNA slips by +/-1 nucleotides, resulting in the translation of an entirely different peptide sequence from that point forward. While frameshifting is generally detrimental to protein fidelity (Belew et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2015) , the process effectively creates two distinct proteins from a single RNA (Clark et al., 2007; Meydan et al., 2017; Yordanova et al., 2015) . Viruses exploit this aspect of frameshifting to minimize their genomes and to successfully replicate in host cells (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Brierley et al., 1989; Caliskan et al., 2015; Cardno et al., 2015; Mouzakis et al., 2013) . A prototypical example is HIV, which utilizes frameshifting to translate the gag-pol proteins from a single viral RNA (Guerrero et al., 2015) .
Although frameshifting has been extensively studied in vitro and in bulk assays (Caliskan et al., 2014; Charbonneau et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Lopinski et al., 2000; Mouzakis et al., 2013; Ritchie et al., 2017) , the process has never been observed at the single molecule level in living cells. This leaves many basic questions about frameshifting unresolved. In particular, it is not clear how heterogenous frameshifting is from one RNA to another, nor is it clear if single RNA continuously frameshift in a constitutive fashion or if instead they frameshift in definable bursts, as has been observed for transcription (Lionnet and Singer, 2012) and 0-frame translation (Wu et al., 2016) . Finally, the localization of frameshifting has never been investigated, so it is not clear if frameshifting occurs all throughout the cell or is instead preferentially localized to specific sub-cellular regions. In the case of HIV-1 gag-pol, for example, previous assays have shown that 5-10% of translated protein product is frameshifted (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Dulude et al., 2002; Grentzmann et al., 1998; Mouzakis et al., 2013) . This is thought to occur when ribosomes translate through a specialized frameshift sequence (FSS) containing a stem loop structure that slows down incoming ribosomes and causes them to slip back one nucleotide on a slippery sequence preceding the stem loop. Whether or not this occurs constitutively and with equal probability on all HIV-1 RNA or if instead it occurs on a specialized subset that are in the right place, at the right time, and with the right factors remains to be determined.
To directly address these sorts of questions, we have developed technology to visualize and quantify single RNA frameshifting dynamics in living cells. Using multi-frame repeat epitopes, complementary high-affinity fluorescent probes that selectively bind the epitopes, and multicolor single-molecule microscopy, we are able to simultaneously monitor the translation of single RNA into two unique nascent polypeptide chains encoded in shifted open reading frames. Application to the HIV-1 FSS uncovers unexpected heterogeneity in the production of frameshifted product and implicates a novel bursty frameshifting mechanism. Besides frameshifting, our technology can now be used to examine other translational regulatory dynamics, including upstream open reading frame selection, non-canonical initiation, and ribosomal shunting. We anticipate multi-frame nascent chain tracking will be a powerful new tool to dissect complex translational regulatory dynamics in living cells and organisms.
A multi-frame tag to monitor single RNA translation in two reading frames simultaneously We created a multi-frame (MF) tag to monitor, in living cells, the translation of single RNAs with overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). The tag builds off earlier technology to visualize translation using repeat FLAG or SunTag epitopes labeled by fluorescent Fab or scFv, respectively (Lyon and Stasevich, 2017; Morisaki and Stasevich, 2018) . In the MF tag, FLAG epitopes in the 0 frame are separated from one another by SunTag epitopes in the -1 frame. With this arrangement, single RNAs with ribosomes translating the 0 frame will produce FLAG epitopes labeled by Fab, while those with ribosomes translating the -1 frame will produce SunTag epitopes labeled by scFv. Thus, depending on the chosen frame(s), polysomes will appear all green (all ribosomes translating the 0 frame), all blue (all ribosomes translating the -1 frame), or some combination of the two (Fig. 1A) .
To ensure both frames of the MF tag encode functional proteins and have similar ribosomal occupancy, we inserted the first exon of the human GNAS1 locus downstream of the FLAG and SunTag epitopes. The GNAS1 locus contains two overlapping ORFs of roughly equivalent lengths that encode peripheral membrane proteins in the 0 and -1 frames: XXLb1 and AlexX (Abramowitz et al., 2004; Aydin et al., 2009) (Fig. 1A ). In combination with the epitopes, this arrangement has several advantages: 1) epitope densities are maximal since -1 frame epitopes act as linkers for the 0 frame and vice versa; 2) signals are digital, so frameshifted and non-frameshifted species are marked by two distinct probes/colors, and 3) epitopes are placed in nearly equivalent positions, so signals appear at roughly the same time and with similar amplification when translated with similar kinetics.
As a first application of the MF tag, we focused on -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting caused by the HIV-1 frameshift sequence (FSS). We inserted the FSS upstream of our MF tag and transiently transfected the resulting construct into U-2 OS cells. The FSS contains a slippery poly-U stretch nine nucleotides upstream of a stem loop. Two to ten hours post transfection, we observed cells with tens or hundreds of individual RNA diffusing throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1B) . Nascent Chain To confirm these RNA were active translation sites, or polysomes, we performed two experiments. First, we re-imaged cells 12-24 hours after transfection. At these later time points, Fab and scFv began to accumulate in the cell membrane ( Fig. S1 and Movie this frame encoding a functional protein, as demonstrated by shifting the sequence by one nucleotide into the 0 frame ( Fig. S1 and Movie S2, right panels). Second, we treated cells with the translational inhibitor puromycin. Just minutes after treatment, we observed a dramatic decrease in the number of Fab-and/or scFv-labeled RNA, consistent with the premature release of nascent chains ( Fig. 1D and Movie S3). Together, these data provide strong evidence that we are able to detect single RNA frameshifting dynamics with the MF tag.
The HIV-1 FSS structure has been previously shown to produce frameshifted protein with an efficiency of 5-10% based on the dual luciferase assay and similar bulk assays (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Dulude et al., 2002; Grentzmann et al., 1998; Mouzakis et al., 2013) . However, it remains unclear how this percentage is established. One possibility is that all RNA behave more or less the same and their ribosomes frameshift with 5-10% probability. On the opposite end of the spectrum, it is possible that RNA display a high degree of heterogeneity, so that just 5-10% of RNA have ribosomes that frameshift with nearly 100% probability. A third possibility is that frameshifting is common on all RNA, but frameshifted proteins are less stable and degraded faster than nonframeshifted proteins.
As a first step to quantify frameshifting dynamics at the single-molecule level, we tracked thousands of individual RNA approximately two to ten hours post transfection with and without the FSS sequence present (±FSS; Fig. 2A -C). In the +FSS cells, we found 92 ± 1.3% of translation sites were translating the canonical 0 frame alone, while 6.2 ± 1.1% were translating both the 0 and -1 frames. Only rarely did we observe translation All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

To ensure these results were not influenced by the multi-frame tag, we reversed the FLAG and SunTag epitopes in the tag and repeated experiments. This gave nearly the same percentages, confirming the tag order and/or epitope positioning did not bias measurements ( Fig. S3 and Movie S5). We then repeated experiments in cells transfected with the control -FSS construct. In this case, we observed virtually no frameshifting sites (0.9 ± 0.7%) ( Fig. 2C and Movie S6). Taken together, these data suggest the FSS alone causes ~8% of translation sites to frameshift.
To further characterize the efficiency of frameshifting, we quantified the precise number of frameshifted versus non-frameshifted ribosomes per translation site. To do this, we re-imaged the MF tag at high laser powers so we could simultaneously visualize single mature XXLb1 or AlexX proteins in comparison to their nascent chains within translation sites (Fig. S4 ). After renormalizing the fluorescence, we found frameshifting sites with translation in both the 0 and -1 frames had 7.8 ± 0.7 ribosomes total, 1.9 ± 0.3 of which were frameshifted, while 0-frame only translation sites had 3.2 ± 0.1 ribosomes and -1-frame only translation sites had 3.4 ± 1.4 frameshifted ribosomes (Fig. 2B,D) .
Thus, although just ~8% of translation sites contained frameshifted ribosomes, within these subset of sites, anywhere between 30 to 100% of ribosomes were frameshifted.
These data support a heterogenous RNA model in which frameshifting occurs on a small subset of RNA with high probability.
Given the heterogeneity of observed frameshifting, we hypothesized that the frameshifting state could be stimulated by a specific sub-cellular environment. To test this All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/478040 doi: bioRxiv preprint hypothesis, we performed a statistical analysis of all tracks to see if any biophysical parameters correlated with frameshifting. This revealed frameshifting sites diffuse more slowly than other translation sites or RNA (Fig. 2E ) and were also slightly more likely to be near the nuclear periphery (Fig. 2F) . These results are consistent with a slight preference for frameshifting in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum, where RNA are less mobile and more efficiently translated (Voigt et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016) .
Of the parameters we quantified, one of the strongest correlates of frameshifting was RNA intensity. Specifically, sites translating the -1 frame had an average RNA intensity that was nearly 30% brighter than RNA only spots ( Fig. 2B and S5A ). In addition, these brighter frameshifting sites were translation-dependent, dissociating upon puromycin treatment (Movie S7). We wondered if this might be an artifact due to the aggregation of probes. Self-aggregation of Fab was unlikely as this would cause 0-frame translation sites to also be brighter, which was not the case (Fig. 2B) . Similarly, it was unlikely to be due to self-aggregation of scFv, as this would cause 0-frame translation sites to be brighter in the reverse MF tag, which was also not the case (Fig. S5B ). This left the possibility that Fab aggregate with scFv. To rule this out, we reimaged the MF tag without Fab. As frameshifting translation sites remained brighter than other sites ( Fig.   S5C ), we conclude the brighter RNA signal is not a tagging artifact, but instead represents a propensity for frameshifting sites to associate with other translating RNA in higher-order complexes reminiscent of ""translation factories"" (Morisaki et al., 2016; Pichon et al., 2016) .
We did not observe factories in cells transfected with the control -FSS construct ( Fig. S5D ). We therefore reasoned the FSS itself might facilitate frameshifting in factories. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https: //doi.org/10.1101/478040 doi: bioRxiv preprint To test this model, we co-transfected a short oligo RNA containing the FSS alone into cells expressing the +FSS MF tag. This led to a significant increase in the fraction of frameshifting sites translating just the -1 frame, from 1.6 to 5.6% when 1 g oligo was added, and up to 9.5% when 4 g oligo was added (Fig. 3A,B) . The significant increase in the -1 only sites suggests RNA can exist in a state in which all or nearly all ribosomes are frameshifted. Moreover, frameshifting continued to occur preferentially within factories, having RNA signals from 30 to 50% brighter than RNA-only spots (Fig. 3C) , even though the overall fraction of RNA within factories remained unchanged (Fig. S6 ).
Importantly, in control cells expressing the -FSS construct, we did not see an increase in frameshifting upon oligo RNA co-transfection. Collectively, these data provide further support for a model in which the HIV-1 FSS itself facilitates frameshifting in factories.
The ~8% of frameshifted translation sites we observed is consistent with previous measurements of 5-10% frameshifted protein product (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Dulude et al., 2002; Grentzmann et al., 1998; Mouzakis et al., 2013) . All else equal, this implies that frameshifting alone can explain the steady-state levels of frameshifted protein, without the need for other regulatory mechanisms, such as protein degradation.
To test this hypothesis, we measured the elongation rate of frameshifted ribosomes compared to non-frameshifted ribosomes. Fits to the linear portion of run-off curves yielded similar post-tag run-off times of ~386 s and ~475 s, corresponding to average elongation rates of 2.7 ± 0.3 aa/sec and 2.2 ± 0.6 aa/sec, respectively ( Fig. 4A and Fig.   S7 ). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments further confirmed these measurements without the use of drugs ( Fig. S8 and Movie S8). Based on these similar All rights reserved.

Accounting for the number of ribosomes per translation site and their relative fractions, we calculate a cell with 100 RNA would produce ~115 frameshifted protein per hour compared to ~2,220 canonical proteins. In other words, frameshifted proteins would account for ~5% of the total, in agreement with earlier measurements. Thus, the dynamics of the FSS sequence alone can be sufficient to account for the steady-state levels of frameshifted protein in living cells, without the need for additional regulatory mechanisms.
Despite the similar elongation rates, we noticed a slight (~60 s) delay in the run-off response at frameshifting translation sites (Sun sites Fig 4A) . Given earlier work showing the potential of the FSS to pause ribosomes (Dulude et al., 2002) , we envisioned this delay could be due to a queue or traffic jam of ribosomes upstream of the FSS within frameshifting sites. As the backed-up ribosomes clear the traffic jam, they replenish the loss of ribosomes running-off. Only after the traffic jam is fully cleared does the number of ribosomes beyond the FSS (with labeled nascent chains) begin to decay.
To test this possibility, we added a 10x HA epitope repeat upstream of the FSS (Fig. 4B ). This served two purposes: first, it allowed us to monitor both ribosomes upstream of the FSS (translating HA epitopes) and ribosomes downstream (translating either 0 frame FLAG or -1 frame SunTag epitopes); second, the arrangement more closely mimicked the natural placement of the FSS between the gag-pol polyproteins. In particular, the additional sequence space upstream of the FSS could accommodate longer ribosomal traffic jams, should they occur. We hypothesized that longer ribosomal All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/478040 doi: bioRxiv preprint traffic jams would lead to longer run-off delays. Consistent with this, ribosomes within frameshifting sites took much longer to run-off (Fig. 4B) , with frameshifted ribosome levels fluctuating but remaining overall steady for upwards of 3000 s, despite an overall ribosome loss (Figs. S9 and S10). We observed this trend even at the single-molecule level, where the total number of ribosomes (marked by HA) dropped, but the number of Such a release can be seen in the single-molecule track at the ~1000 s time point, when the frameshift signal gets significantly brighter. Interestingly, this increase in brightness coincided with the association of an additional non-translating +FSS RNA (gray arrows in Fig. 4C ). This is consistent with the hypothesis that multi-RNA factories stimulate frameshifting. Although difficult to capture, we observed this type of stimulated frameshifting burst in another single frameshifting RNA track as well (Fig. S11 ).
To quantify the kinetics of frameshifting, we developed two candidate models and attempted to fit each to our three main observations: (i) the percentages of frameshifting versus non-frameshifting translation sites (Fig. 4C ), (ii) ribosomal occupancies (Fig 4D) , and (iii) run-off kinetics (Figs. 4E,F). Both models include initiation of ribosomes, codondependent elongation of proteins along the RNA template, and ribosomal exclusion to block ribosomes from passing one another or occupying the same place on the RNA.
The only difference in the two models is the treatment for how ribosomes shift from the 0 to the -1 frame.
The first model assumes constitutive frameshifting, in which all ribosomes frameshift at the FSS with equal probability. This model could capture either observation (i) or (ii), but not both simultaneously; frameshifting either led to excessively large fractions of frameshifting sites or excessively small ribosomal loading, in disagreement with our observations that a relatively small fraction of RNA frameshift with relatively high ribosomal occupancies. Even with addition of distinct pauses in elongation at the FSS in both frames, the constitutive model was unable to fit our data (Fig. S12 ).
The second model is inspired by two-state gene models that are commonly used to describe heterogeneous transcription (Munsky et al., 2012) . In this `bursty' model, RNA stochastically switch between non-frameshifting and frameshifting states in which either 0% or 100% of ribosomes produce frameshifted proteins (Fig. 5A ). In the bursty model, the RNA frameshift state is assumed to switch ON and OFF at rates and , respectively, and the steady state fraction of RNA in the ON state is given by = /( + ). We estimated f from the observed fraction of frameshifting translation sites (Fig. 2C ).
To estimate the timescale of and , we tracked translation sites for longer periods of time. To achieve this tracking, we doubled the number of epitopes in the multiframe reporter (creating the +FSS 2x multi-frame tag) and changed our imaging strategy to sample the RNA signal at all time points and the 0 and -1 translation signals once every fifth time point. This arrangement substantially reduced photobleaching and allowed us to continuously track and monitor the translational status of single translation sites in 3D
for nearly an hour. Fig. 5B shows the frameshifting state survival times for the seven translation sites we tracked in this manner, including one site that frameshifted for longer All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Remarkably, this frameshifting translation site associated with another for a large part of the 40-minute imaging window, which supports our hypothesis that the FSS facilitates frameshifting in multi-RNA sites. From the frameshift state survival times, we fit the rate of to be ~0.0013 sec -1 (Fig. 5B S12 ). To account for the different run-off delays seen at frameshifting and non-frameshifting sites (seen in Fig. 4A ,B), the model required elongation pauses of 1/ ~ 48 s at non-frameshifting sites and 1/ * ~ 90 s at frameshifting sites. We explored if codon usage could also explain the differences in run-off times. However, according to the codon adaptation index (Gorgoni et al., 2016; Sharp and Li, 1987) , which is related to the speed at which each codon is translated in the simulation, there is no notable difference between the 0 and -1 frames ( Fig. S14) . Moreover, the distinct pauses predicted by the model are comparable to those previously measured using in vitro and in vivo bulk assays (Lopinski et al., 2000) .

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/478040 doi: bioRxiv preprint Because the estimated average pause time, 1/ * , is greater than the average initiation time, 1/ , ribosomes could initiate faster than they clear the FSS with an excess rate of − * = 0.009 per second and create upstream traffic jams in frameshifting sites. These traffic jams would continue to build for as long as the RNA remains in the frameshifted state, or approximately 1/ = 770 s on average. This would allow for the accumulation of approximately ( − * ) / ~ 7 ribosomes (on the HA multi-frame tag, Table 1 ). Occasionally, traffic jams can extend all the way back to the start codon, as seen in a sample simulation (Movie S11). However, because these traffic jams occur upstream of the FSS within the HA epitope repeats, the nascent chain intensity at translation sites is only partially correlated with ribosomal occupancy. As a result, the model predicts frameshifting sites are slightly brighter than non-frameshifting sites ( Fig.   5G ), which we also observe experimentally (Fig. S15 ). Moreover, due to the long time it can take to clear traffic jams, frameshifting can persist for hours following the global shut down of translation initiation (with harringtonine, for example), as can be seen in simulations of the best-fit model (Movie S12) and consistent with what we observed in Figs. 4C and S11. Thus, the final bursty model suggests a mechanism by which frameshifting can persist for long periods in the absence of translation initiation.
Frameshifting is a common tactic used by viruses to minimize their genomes for faster, more efficient replication in host cells, effectively getting two viral proteins for the price of one viral RNA.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/478040 doi: bioRxiv preprint nucleotide precision in vitro, until now frameshifting had not been directly observed in a living system. To achieve this, we created a multi-frame repeat epitope tag that can light up single RNA translation sites in different colors depending on which open reading frame is being translated. Together with sensitive single-molecule microscopy and computational modeling, we have demonstrated five novel aspects of HIV-1 frameshifting:
(i) frameshifted proteins originate from a small subset of RNA that frameshift with high efficiency; (ii) frameshifting occurs preferentially in multi-RNA translation factories that are facilitated in part by the frameshift sequence; (iii) frameshifting occurs in bursts on single RNA that can last for several rounds of translation; (iv) ribosomes that frameshift are paused for longer at the frameshifting sequence than ribosomes that do not frameshift;
and (v) pauses at the frameshift sequence induce ribosomal traffic jams that can maintain the production of frameshifted protein despite global inhibition of translation. Fig. 6 summarizes our findings.
In contrast to constitutive frameshifting on any RNA, our data indicate that frameshifting occurs in bursts on a subset of RNA. Bursty expression has been demonstrated by others, both at single transcription sites as well as at translation sites in bacteria (Lionnet and Singer, 2012) and eukaryotes (Wu et al., 2016) . The origin of frameshifting bursts is difficult to pinpoint. It is tempting to speculate that there is a unique structure the RNA takes that enhances frameshifting, particularly given the distinct pause times in our best-fit model. According to our observations, multi-RNA translation factories appear to be more susceptible to frameshift bursts. Such factories have been previously observed (Morisaki et al., 2016; Pichon et al., 2016) . Local concentration of translation factors is higher within factories, so translation kinetics are enhanced (Pichon et al., All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/478040 doi: bioRxiv preprint 2016). However, the crowding of machinery at these factory sites may cause them to be more prone to errors and even more so with increased interactions with other FSSencoding RNA, the FSS being a proverbial wrench within translational factory machinery.
Such low-fidelity factories may benefit viral robustness, where mutations are desirable.
Consistent with this idea, HIV-1 RNAs prefer a dimeric state which may promote translation factory formation (Barajas et al., 2018) .
In this study, we observed frameshifting in the context of factories in three different circumstances. First, in puromycin experiments, we observed frameshifting sites separate into two frameshifting sites upon translation shut-down (Movie S7). Second, we observed on two occasions non-translating RNA interact with a frameshifting site, after which the frameshifting signal at the site markedly increased (Figs. 4E and S11). Third, when we co-transfected FSS oligo RNA into cells (Fig. 3) , frameshifting increased in proportion to the amount we co-transfected. Collectively, these data suggest a causal ordering, whereby interactions between FSS-encoding sequences lead to enhanced frameshifting.
According to our best-fit model, pauses always occur at the frameshift sequence, with longer pauses associated with frameshifting RNA compared to non-frameshifting RNA. Pausing in and of itself is therefore only a weak predictor of frameshifting, as others have shown (Kontos et al., 2001; Tu et al., 1992) . Nevertheless, the longer pauses associated with frameshifting suggest the frameshift sequence can adopt more than one The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/478040 doi: bioRxiv preprint an elevated ribosomal occupancy as far back as ~400 codons from the FSS, a length that coincides almost perfectly with the length of the FSS-upstream sequence in HIV-1 gagpol. This is not unprecedented, as ribosome profiling experiments have also found evidence for relatively high ribosomal densities as far back as the start codon of the gag protein (Napthine et al., 2017) . These data suggest the strength of the HIV-1 pause may have evolved to on occasion produce the longest possible traffic jams. As clearance of these jams takes time, frameshifting can persist on RNA for hours despite a global shutdown of translation initiation. In effect, the jam acts like a battery that continually fuels the Beyond the imaging of HIV-1 translational frameshifting, the multi-frame tag can now be used in a variety of other contexts. For example, it can immediately be used to investigate frameshifting dynamics along other viral RNA sequences, as well as frameshifting thought to occur along endogenous human mRNA (Cardno et al., 2015) .
Likewise, the multi-frame tag can be used to examine other non-canonical translation processes involving more than one open reading frame, including start-codon selection, leaky scanning, ribosomal shunting, and general translation fidelity. In fact, in an accompanying paper, a similar multi-frame tag was used to examine upstream and downstream open reading frame selection (Boersma et al.) . Like us, the authors also saw a high degree of heterogeneity between translating RNAs, with bursts of translation All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The HIV-1 frameshift sequence (FSS) followed by either the multi-frame (MF) tag or the reverse multi-frame (revMF) tag were synthesized by GeneArt® gene synthesis service (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The gene fragments were flanked by NotI and NheI, and fused to the upstream of the beta-actin zipcode and 24x MS2 stem loops in the 3' UTR of plasmid pUB_smFLAG_ActB_MS2 (Plasmid #81083, addgene) to obtain the FSS-MF and FSS-revMF, respectively. To double the MF tag, the MF tag region was digested out from FSS-MF with XbaI and AgeI, and then ligated into FSS-MF flanked with NheI and
AgeI. The open reading frame encoding human XXLb1/AlexX (Abramowitz et al., 2004; Aydin et al., 2009 ) was amplified from U-2 OS cells cDNA with the primers: 5'-GTT GTC ATA TGG GCG TGC GCA ACT -3'; 5'-GAT GTA GCT AGC CTA GAA GCA GCA GGC GGT G -3'. The amplified XXLb1/AlexX was flanked with NsiI and NheI, and then inserted into the C-terminal region of the FSS-MF, FSS-2xMF and FSS-revMF to obtain FSS-MF-AlexX (i.e. the +FSS multi-frame tag), FSS-2xMF-AlexX (i.e. the +FSS 2x multi-frame tag), and FSS-revMF-AlexX (i.e. the +FSS reverse multi-frame tag), respectively.

Briefly, beads conjugated with ficin were incubated in 25 mM cysteine to digest FLAG (Wako, 012-22384 Anti DYKDDDDK mouse IgG2b monoclonal) or HA (Sigma-Aldrich, H3663 HA-7 IgG1 mouse monoclonal) antibodies to generate Fab. Fab were separated from the digested Fc region using a NAb Protein A column (Thermo Scientific, product # 1860592). Fab were concentrated to ~1 mg/ml and conjugated to either Cy3 or Alexa Fluor 488 (A488). Cy3 Nhydroxysuccinimide ester (Invitrogen) or A488 tetrafluorophenyl ester (Invitrogen) was suspended in DMSO and stored at -20°C. 100 µg of Fab were mixed with 10 µL of 1M NaHCO3, to a final volume of 100 µL. 2.66 µl of Cy3 (or 5 l of A488) was added to this 100 µL mixture and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with end-over-end rotation.
The dye conjugated Fab were eluted from a PBS equilibrated PD-mini G-25 desalting column (GE Healthcare) to remove unconjugated dye. Dye conjugated Fabs then were concentrated in an Ultrafree 0.5 filter (10k-cut off; Millipore) to 1 mg/ml.

Second, in cell culture hood, DMEM was aspirated from the MatTek chamber and the 4 µl mix was pipetted on top of cells. Third, ~106 µm glass beads (Sigma Aldrich) were evenly sprinkled over the cells. Fourth, the chamber was tapped carefully ~10 times on the cell culture hood bench top. Fifth, DMEM was immediately added back to the cells. Sixth, cells were returned to the incubator for at least an hour to recover from the loading procedure. In most experiments, we also bead-loaded DNA, which we added to the initial 4 µl mix (so that DNA had a final concentration close to 1 mg/ml). On occasion, DNA was transiently transfected ~2 hours before bead-loading. Around one hour before experiments began, bead-loaded cells were washed with phenol-red-free complete DMEM to remove glass beads, and 200 nM of JF646-HaloTag ligand (a cell permeable fluorogenic ligand (Grimm et al., 2015) ) was added to label MCP-HaloTag protein. After 30 mins of incubation, cells were washed three times using phenol-red-free complete DMEM to remove any unconjugated fluorophores. Cells were then immediately imaged for experiments.
To track single molecule translation sites, a custom-built widefield fluorescence microscope based on a highly inclined illumination scheme (Tokunaga et al., 2008 ) was used (Morisaki et al., 2016 . Briefly, the excitation beams, 488, 561 and 637 nm solidstate lasers (Vortran), were coupled and focused at the back focal plane of the objective lens (60X, NA 1.49 oil immersion objective, Olympus).

Readout time for the cameras from the combination of our imaging size, readout mode, and the vertical shift speed was 23.36 msec, resulting in an imaging rate of 13 Hz (70 msec per image). The excitation laser lines were digitally synched to ensure they only illuminated cells when the camera was exposing in order to avoid excessive photobleaching. To capture the entire volume of the cytoplasm of U-2 OS cells, 13 zstacks with step size of 500 nm (6 µm in total) were imaged using the piezoelectric stage such that the z-position changed every 2 images (one image for Cy3 and one for All rights reserved.

The position of the filter wheel was changed during the camera readout time. This resulted in a total cellular imaging rate of 0.5 Hz (2 sec per volume for 3-colors). Note that all colors described in the text and that are shown in the figures are based on the color of the excitation laser: RNA in red (JF646) and protein in green (Cy3) or blue (sfGFP/A488).
Images were first pre-processed using either Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012) or a customwritten batch processing Mathematica code (Wolfram Research) to make 2D maximum intensity projections from 3D images. Pre-processed images were then analyzed with a custom-written Mathematica code to detect and track particles. Specifically, particles were emphasized with a band-pass filter so the positions could be detected using the built-in Mathmatica routine ComponentMeasurements ""IntensityCentroid"". Detected particles were linked through time by allowing a maximum displacement of 5 pixels between consecutive frames. Particle tracks lasting at least 5-10 frames were selected and their precise coordinates were determined by fitting (using the built-in Mathematica routine NonlinearModelFit) the original 2D maximum intenstiy projected images to a 2D Gaussians of the following form:

We did not register the images, but only the fitted positions in order to avoid introducing any distortion into images. This is why a slight offset can be observed between the red and the green/blue particles even though they are within a diffraction limited spot, according to our registration.
For visuallization and some quantification, average intensity image trims were created by averaging images of all detected particles of a given species (each centered by their intensity centroid). To compute the average number of ribosomes in a translation site (see Fig. S4 ), the average image trims of translation sites and single mature proteins were fitted to Eq. (2). The average intensities were calculated by integrating the fitted Gaussian. The ratio of the average intensity of translation sites to that of single mature proteins was then calculated to give the average number of ribosomes in a translation site. The average intensity of single RNAs were also calculated using the same procedure ( Fig. 3C , S5, and S6). Fits were susceptible to noise, so we also used an alternative strategy to determine the average intensity of translation sites and RNA that was robust to noise (in all Figs aside from Fig. 3C , S4, S5, and S6). Specifically, the intensity of centered images of RNA or translation sites was calculated to be the average intensity within a centered radial spot of four pixels in diameter minus the average background intensity from a centered ring with an outer diameter of twelve pixels and an inner diameter of eight pixels.

The trims were then hand checked to remove any trims with artifacts, e.g., smears or non-diffraction limited spots. Next, a custom Mathematica code was used to detect particles in the 0 ORF or -1 ORF trim channels, sorting the spots into RNA only, 0 frame translation sites (0 TS only), 0 and -1 TS, and -1 only TS. For all cases, RNA always had to be present. Finally, frameshifting translation sites (the 0 and -1 TS or the -1 only TS) were validated by eye, to further remove artifacts.
For example, RNA that briefly colocalized with a mature protein puncta were removed at this stage. After all sites were validated, the total count of each type of species was used to determine the percentage of non-translating RNA (no TS), 0 frame translation sites (0 TS), 0 and -1 TS, and -1 only TS.
To confirm active translation elongation, puromycin (Sigma Aldrich) was used to release nascent chains from elongating ribosomes, leading to a rapid loss of nascent chain signal at translation sites. Bead-loaded cells with visible translation sites were imaged at a rate of one volume every seven seconds. After acquiring 16 pre-images, cells were treated with a final concentration of 100 µg/ml puromycin and continuously imaged for an additional 100 time points.

Oligo FSS RNA co-transfection An uncapped RNA oligo containing the FSS from HIV-1 was synthesized from IDTDNA with the following RNA sequence: 5'-CUG GCC UUC CCU UGU GGG AAG GCC AGA UCU UCC CUA AAA AA -3'. Co-transfection of FSS-MF-AlexX and the RNA oligo was carried out via bead-loading, as describe above. Briefly, 1 µg plasmid FSS-MF-AlexX construct DNA, 100 µg/ml of fluorescently labeled Fab, 250 µg/ml of purified (GCN4) scFv-sfGFP or 1 µg of (GCN4) scFv-sfGFP plasmid, 1 or 4 µg of RNA oligo, and 33 µg/ml of purified MCP-HaloTag protein were mixed with PBS to a final volume of ~4 µl of PBS.
To measure the average elongation rate, harringtonine (Cayman Chemical) was used to block translation initiation and iduce the run-off of all actively elongating ribosomes, leading to a gradual loss of nascent chain signal at translation sites. Beadloaded cells with visible translation sites were imaged as described above except that cell volumes were acquired every 60 or 120 seconds. After acquiring 5 pre-images, cells were treated with a final concentration of 3 µg/ml Harringtonine and continuously imaged for 30 more time points. As a control, the same imaging conditions were performed except that cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO). In this case, nascent chain signals did not decay (data not shown).

Run-off curves were normalized to the mean of the total intensity of the first four time points after treatment of harringtonine began. These curves were then fit to a linear regression to estimate run-off times (see Fig. S7 ). The linear portion of the runoff decay begins when the normalized run-off intensity reaches a fraction 0 , where
where 1 is the length of untagged portion of the open reading frame and 2 is the length of the tagged portion (i.e. the length of the repeated epitopes), as described (Morisaki and Stasevich, 2018). The linear portion of the decay was then interpolated to background levels to estimate the run-off time . The elongation rate was calculated as follows:
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
To confirm elongation rates of frameshifting translation sites, FRAP experiments were performed. Bead-loaded cells with visible translation sites were imaged once every 10 seconds, with an intentional photobleach at frame 10. The photobleach was performed with a 405 nm laser focused to a spot roughly 5 m in diameter and operating at a minimal power such that the nascent chain signal did not completely vanish. This allowed us to track the translation site continously throughout the experiment. Following the intentional photobleach, the fluorescence recovery of translation sites within the bleach zone were monitored for an additional 80 time points. These translation sites were tracked and their intensities quantified, as described above. To correct for unintentional photobleaching, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The loss of signal from the control translation site was fit to a single exponential decay and this decay was divided out from the FRAP recovery curves of the intentionally photobleached translation sites. The FRAP recovery curve can be thought of as the inverse of the harringtonine runoff curve (Morisaki and Stasevich, 2018) . In this way, the FRAP recovery curve was fit to determine the average translation elongation rate (Fig. S8 ).
The frameshift models describe the stochastic dynamics of nascent translation with single-codon resolution. Both the constitutive and bursting models are formulated to track an arbitrary number of individual ribosomes that can perform three possible reactions: (i)
A new ribosome can initiate translation at the start codon at rate kini. (ii) An existing ribosome can elongate at rate ke to incorporate one amino acid into the nascent peptide chain. The rate ke is sequence-specific with each codon's rate scaled by the genomic copy of the corresponding codon (Nakamura et al., 1999) . When the ribosome completes the final amino acid, translation is terminated and that ribosome is eliminated. (iii) A ribosome at the frameshift sequence can shift from the 0 to the -1 frame. In addition to these three reactions, ribosomes at the frameshift sequence can pause for an average time of 1/ * or 1/ for the shifted and non-shifted states. For the bursting model, each RNA is assumed to switch back and forth between non-frameshifting and frameshifting states with rates and . With these mechanisms and parameters, the models can be analyzed using either simplified approximations or detailed simulations.

Simulations were started at t = -10,000 seconds to approximate steady state at t = 0 using the Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie, 1976) . Ribosome densities were found by collecting position statistics for multiple simulations. Simulated ribosome numbers and positions and multi-frame tag probe locations were combined to estimate translation site intensities. Harringtonine assays were simulated by preventing the initiation reaction at the time of treatment. Parameter estimation was performed using genetic algorithms and a multiple-objective cost function that considers the frameshifting efficiency, the number of ribosomes per RNA and the Harringtonine assays. A detailed description of the computational methods and codes is given in the 'Computational Details' section below.

Relating model dynamics to experimental fluorescence intensity. To relate ribosome occupancy to experimental translation spots, we proscribe an assumed fluorescence to each ribosome based upon its position. This intensity is proportional to the number of peptide probes upstream from the ribosome location and in the appropriate frame or frames. Ribosomes in the 0 frame include all upstream probes in the 0 frame. Ribosomes in the -1 frame include probes in the 0 frame between the start codon and the FSS (if any) and probes in the -1 frame between the FSS and the current ribosome position.

Experimental data was measured between 2 to 6 hours post bead-loading for a period of 120 seconds. To reproduce these experimental data, the model was solved using 100 trajectories of 120 seconds starting at steady state. Spots were classified as 0 frame only ( 0 ) , -1 frame only ( −1 ) and both frames ( ) .
Following the experimental observation that frameshifting spots commonly consist of more than one RNA, were equally added to the 0 and −1 . The percentage of nonframeshifting translation spots was calculated as follows:

Number of ribosomes per RNA. Experimental observations allowed to quantify the number of ribosomes in frameshifting and non-frameshifting translation spots ( Figure 2 in the main text). To relate model simulations and data, the number of ribosomes per RNA was estimated by directly by adding the number of ribosomes in each RNA at steady state.

Harringtonine inhibits translation by binding to the ribosomal 60S sub-unit, which blocks new initiation events. Experimental data showed that Harringtonine causes the intensity in translating spots to drop to a basal intensity value after a run-off time (Figure 4 in main text). To mimic the effects of Harringtonine in our model we modified the initiation rate as:

The epidemic of 2019-nCoV was first discovered by metagenomic next-generation 69 sequencing (mNGS) in which the novel virus was found to be a new pathogenic member of 70 the betacoronavirus genus but shared only about 79% in genetic similarity with SARS. [8, 9] 71 Currently, metagenomics and RT-PCR are two molecular approaches most commonly used 72 diagnostics for this novel virus.

041bae0a6de2b69979d39460b3f2ee8946534ec2,"In the note, the logistic growth regression model is used for the estimation of the final size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic in China, South Korea, and the rest of the World.
In the previous article [1], we try to estimate the final size of the epidemic for the whole World using the logistic model and SIR model. The estimation was about 83000 cases.
Both models show that the outbreak is moderating; however, new data showed a linear upward trend. It turns out that the epidemy in China was slowing but is begin to spread elsewhere in the World.
In this note, we will give forecasting epidemic size for China, South Korea, and the rest of the World and daily predictions using the logistic model. Full daily reports and counties outside of China generated are available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339912313_Forecasting_of_final_COVID -19_epidemic_size
The MATLAB program fitVirus used for calculations is freely available from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74411-fitvirus We note that logistic models give similar results as the SIR model (at least for the case of China and South Korea). However, the logistic model is given by explicit formula and is thus much simpler for regression analysis than the SIR model, where one must on each optimization step solve a system of ordinary differential equations. (One may,","however, use approximate solution and thus obtain four-parameter problem which can be very sensitive to initial guess). Yet, the logistics model has its drawbacks as the epidemic approaches its final stage: the actual number of cases may be slightly larger than that predicted by the logistics model. If the actual number of cases begins to exceed the predicted end-state systematically, then a second phase of the epidemic is likely to occur, and the model will no longer be applicable.
In mathematical epidemiology, when one uses a phenomenological approach, the epidemic dynamics can be described by the following variant of logistic growth model [2] [3] [4] [5] 
where C is an accumulated number of cases, 0 r  infection rate, and 0 K  is the final epidemic size. If   0 0 0 C C   is the initial number of cases then the solution of (1) is

There is no natural law or process behind this transformation; therefore, it must be used with some care. In particular, the calculated limit is useless if n K C  , i.e., it is below the current data.
The logistic model (2) contains three parameters: K, r, and A, which should be determined by regression analysis. Because the model is nonlinear, some care should be taken for initial guess. First of all, in the early stage, the logistic curve follows an exponential growth curve (3) , so the estimation of K is practically impossible. With enough data, the initial guess can be obtain in the following way. Expressing t from (2) and use three equidistant data point yield the following system of three equations:

On the base of available data, one can predict that the final size of coronavirus epidemy in China using the logistic model will be approximately 81 000 ± 500 cases (Table 1) and that the peak of the epidemic was on 8 Feb 2020 (Table 2 ). It seems that the epidemic in China is in the ending stage (Fig 3, Fig 4) .
The short-term forecasting is given in Table 3 where we see that the discrepancy of actual and forecasted number of cases is within 2%. However, actual and predicted daily new cases are scattered and vary between 13% to 300%. On 7 Mar 2020, the actual number of cases was 80695, and the daily number of cases was 44.

The comparison of the predicted final sizes is shown in the graph in Figure 6 . Based on the data from 11. Mar 2020, a very rough estimate indicates that the number of cases will be about 90000 (Fig 7) ; data from 13. Mar 2020 rise this number to 380 000.

On the base of available data, one can predict that the final size of coronavirus epidemy in China will be around 81 000 cases. For South Korea, a prediction is about 8000 cases. For the rest of the World, the forecasts are still very unreliable in is now approximately 380 000 cases.
We emphasize that the logistics model is a phenomenological, data-driven model. Thus, its forecasts are as reliable as useful are data and as good as the model can capture the dynamics of the epidemic. As daily epidemic size forecasts begin to converge, it can be said that the outbreak is under control. However, any systematic deviation from the forecast curve may indicate that the epidemic is escaping control. An example is China.
By 25. Feb., the data follows a logistic curve and then begins to deviate from it. We now know that this was the beginning of the second stage of the epidemic, which is now spreading around the World. A similar linear trend can now be observed for South Korea ( Fig 5) ; we hope this does not mark the beginning of the second stage of the epidemic in this country.",Estimation of the final size of the second phase of the coronavirus COVID 19 epidemic by the logistic model,medrxiv,10.1101/2020.03.11.20024901,,,medrvix,2020-03-16,milan batista,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv
05082393ba4c7ec530190dd887d99c74fd72f6d6,,"To examine the role of the kinetochore dynein module (RZZ-Spindly-dynein-dynactin) in kinetochore expansion, we incubated HeLa cells with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules and used immunostaining for the outer kinetochore proteins CENP-E and CENP-F to assess crescent formation (Fig. 1A) . In cells treated with control siRNA, CENP-E and CENP-F expanded into crescents that partially encircled the compact inner kinetochore, marked by CENP-C, as expected (Fig. 1B) . Depletion of the RZZ subunit ROD by RNAi, which eliminated Spindly localization to kinetochores, supported CENP-E and CENP-F recruitment, but kinetochores no longer expanded into crescents (Fig. 1B) . Measurements of kinetochore fluorescence confirmed that ROD depletion reduced both the volume occupied by CENP-E and CENP-F and their overall levels ( Fig. 1C -F) . Depletion of Spindly also reduced kinetochore expansion, albeit not to the same degree as depletion of ROD ( Fig. 1B -F) . By contrast, depletion of the dynactin subunit DCTN1, which prevents kinetochore recruitment of both dynactin and dynein, did not affect kinetochore expansion, as judged by immunostaining for Spindly ( Fig. 1G -I) . We conclude that kinetochore expansion requires RZZ and Spindly but is independent of dynein-dynactin.
Human Spindly directly interacts with the ROD b-propeller [16] , and the b-propeller is essential for Spindly recruitment to kinetochores [15] . The atomic-resolution structure of the RZZ subunit ZWILCH, which forms a tight complex with the ROD b-propeller, features a conserved surface-exposed patch of unknown function in domain 2 [29] (Fig. 1J ). In C. elegans, two acidic residues in this patch are required for an interaction between ZWL-1 Zwilch and SPDL-1 Spindly [15] .
We used the Flp-In system in HeLa cells and RNAi-based molecular replacement to assess the consequences of introducing analogous mutations (E422A/D426A) into human ZWILCH (Fig. 1J ).
Expression of transgene-encoded GFP::ZWILCH, harboring silent mutations that confer RNAi resistance, supported recruitment of Spindly to kinetochores and facilitated kinetochore expansion in nocodazole, as judged by immunostaining for GFP and Spindly (Fig. 1K -M) . By contrast, GFP::ZWILCH(E422A/D426A), while supporting Spindly recruitment to kinetochores, inhibited kinetochore expansion to a similar degree as depletion of ROD ( Fig. 1K -M) . We conclude that kinetochore expansion requires two conserved acidic ZWLICH residues that in C. elegans ZWL-1 Zwilch are implicated in an interaction with SPDL-1 Spindly .
The expanded outer kinetochore is a distinct multi-protein domain that can be dissociated from the KMN network
We found that, following a 4-h incubation in nocodazole, a 30-min treatment of mitotic cells with the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 resulted in complete detachment of the expanded outer domain from the centromere ( Fig. 2A) . Immunostaining showed that crescent-like assemblies in the cytoplasm, separated by several µm from the closest sister kinetochore pair, marked by CENP-C or human anti-centromere antibodies (ACA), contained ZW10, ZWILCH, Spindly, the dynactin subunit DCTN1, CENP-E, MAD1, and MAD2 (Fig. 2B, D) . By contrast, we could not detect KNL1, BUB1, BUBR1, BUB3, CENP-F, HEC1, DSN1, or CENP-C on detached crescents ( Fig. 2D; Fig.   S1 ). Consistently, detached crescents were never observed after depletion of ROD or Spindly.
We conclude that kinetochore expansion involves the assembly of a distinct multi-protein domain with defined composition that is separable from the inner kinetochore and the KMN network.
The robust presence of MAD1-MAD2 on detached kinetochore crescents in the absence of detectable KNL1 or BUB1 implied that RZZ is directly involved in MAD1-MAD2 recruitment.
Interestingly, when we generated detached crescents in cells expressing transgene-encoded GFP::ROD on top of endogenous ROD, CENP-F, BUBR1, and BUB3 were consistently detected on detached crescents (Fig. 2C, D) . Thus, over-expression of GFP::ROD recruited outer kinetochore components that were normally not present at detached crescents. Of note, prior work showed that CENP-F has affinity for recombinant GFP::RZZ [16] , suggesting that RZZ may promote CENP-F recruitment though a direct interaction. Regarding the SAC, these results imply that RZZ is capable of recruiting MCC components to the expanded outer kinetochore independently of KNL1-BUB1.
To test whether over-expression of GFP::ROD promotes kinetochore expansion per se, we expressed GFP::ROD under conditions that usually compromise expansion. Consistent with Strikingly, expression of GFP::ROD in KNL1-depleted cells produced robustly expanded kinetochores (Fig. 3B) . Indeed, GFP::ROD-containing crescents in KNL1-depleted cells were often larger than GFP::ROD crescents in cells treated with control siRNA and occasionally connected kinetochores of adjacent chromosomes (Fig. 3C) . GFP::ROD-containing crescents and rings that were partially or even fully detached from sister kinetochore pairs were also prevalent in KNL1-depleted cells but were never observed in cells treated with control siRNA (Fig.   3B , C). The protein composition of detached GFP::ROD crescents was identical to the detached crescents generated by acute CDK1 inhibition ( Fig. 3C and data not shown). As expected, codepletion of KNL1 and Spindly suppressed kinetochore expansion in cells expressing GFP::ROD ( Fig. 3D) . We also examined the effect of a GFP::ROD mutant missing its N-terminal b-propeller domain (D1-375), which we previously showed localizes to kinetochores but prevents recruitment of ZWILCH and Spindly [15] . GFP::ROD(D1-375) did not support expansion, as we pointed out previously [15] , and depletion of KNL1 greatly reduced the kinetochore signal of the ROD mutant compared to cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. S2 ).
Taken together, these experiments suggest that increased ROD levels facilitate robust kinetochore expansion even when kinetochores have a reduced capacity for RZZ recruitment, and that this depends on Spindly and the ROD b-propeller. This is consistent with an expansion mechanism based on self-assembly of RZZ, for which we present direct evidence below. The GFP::ROD(D1-375) signal likely represents the RZZ pool directly recruited by KNL1-BUB1 without expansion, while the GFP::ROD signal also reflects higher-order assemblies of RZZ. These experiments also show that KNL1-BUB1 are required to tether the expanded outer domain to the core kinetochore.
Rod proteins share a common architecture with membrane coat precursors, which selfassemble into higher-order structures [16] . Self-assembly of ROD into filaments could underlie the central role of ROD in kinetochore expansion that we describe above, but there is currently no evidence that Rod proteins can form oligomeric assemblies. In our search for such evidence, we turned to the nematode C. elegans. In mature oocytes and meiosis I embryos, small filamentous assemblies, referred to as 'linear elements', are present in the cytoplasm and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/282707 doi: bioRxiv preprint S3). Depletion of ROD-1 prevented the formation of linear elements (Fig. S3A ), suggesting that they may represent oligomeric assemblies of ROD-1. Intriguingly, we found that after tagging endogenous ROD-1 with GFP using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, GFP::ROD-1 filaments were not only present in meiosis but also appeared in the cytoplasm of early multicellular embryos (Fig. 4A) . Live imaging revealed that µm-scale GFP::ROD-1 filaments formed with highly reproducible kinetics during mitosis at the 8-cell stage, but not in earlier divisions ( Fig. 4A ; Movie S1). In addition to forming filaments, GFP::ROD-1 localized transiently to holocentric kinetochores and was enriched in nuclei in early embryos at all stages ( Fig. 4A ). At the 8-cell stage, filaments formed rapidly (within ~40 s) in nuclei about 3 min prior to NEBD, at about the same time when the GFP::ROD-1 signal first appeared on kinetochores ( Fig. 4B ; Movie S2). GFP::ROD-1 filaments remained distinct from mitotic chromosomes and segregated to daughter cells by clustering at spindle poles ( Fig. 4B; Fig. S4A ; Movie S2). At the end of mitosis, the filaments largely disassembled before forming again in nuclei prior to NEBD of the subsequent division ( Fig.   S4B ; Movie S2). Interestingly, depletion of SPDL-1 Spindly had no effect on the formation of GFP::ROD-1 filaments but prevented clustering at spindle poles (Fig. S4B) , suggesting that the filaments become tethered to spindle poles via dynein.
We sought to investigate why GFP::ROD-1 filaments formed at this specific time in development. Quantification of the GFP::ROD-1 signal revealed that nuclear levels of GFP::ROD-1 gradually increased with every embryonic division, as well as during the course of each cell cycle, reaching a peak before NEBD (Fig. 4C -E) . Consequently, nuclear GFP::ROD-1 levels before NEBD in 8-cell embryos were significantly higher than nuclear levels in all previous divisions ( Fig. 4C -E ). This suggested a straightforward explanation for the invariant timing of filament formation, namely that GFP::ROD-1 must become sufficiently concentrated before oligomerization is triggered. To directly test this idea, we used a mild RNAi regime to slightly reduce total GFP::ROD-1 levels in the embryo (Fig. 4E , F). In these RNAi conditions, nuclear GFP::ROD-1 levels in 8-cell embryos were comparable to those in control embryos at the 2-cell stage (Fig. 4E) . Strikingly, GFP::ROD-1 no longer formed filaments in 8-cell embryos or at later developmental stages, despite the still prominent enrichment in nuclei and normal localization to mitotic kinetochores (Fig. 4E, F) . These results demonstrate that ROD-1 has a propensity to oligomerize into filaments and suggest that oligomerization can be triggered locally by concentrating ROD-1 above a critical threshold.

The ROD-1 b-propeller suppresses ubiquitous and complete oligomerization of ROD-1 into filaments In human cells, deletion of the ROD b-propeller prevents kinetochore expansion, which may at least in part be a consequence of Spindly's inability to bind RZZ. Because oligomerization of C. elegans ROD-1 into filaments was independent of SPDL-1 Spindly , we wanted to address the role of the ROD-1 b-propeller. We therefore generated animals expressing mCherry::ROD-1 without b-propeller (D1-372) from an RNAi-resistant transgene integrated in single copy at a defined chromosomal locus (Fig. 5A ). We found that mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372), just like full-length mCherry::ROD-1, localized to early embryonic nuclei and mitotic kinetochores when endogenous ROD-1 was present (Fig. 5B ). By contrast, when we depleted endogenous ROD-1 by RNAi, mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372), but not full-length mCherry::ROD-1, oligomerized into filaments measuring up to 15 µm in length that were ubiquitously present throughout the cytoplasm of the oocyte-producing gonad and early embryo, irrespective of developmental and cell cycle stage ( Fig. 5B, D; Fig. S5A ). Oligomerization of mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372) into filaments appeared to be essentially complete judging by the lack of diffuse cytoplasmic signal (Fig. 5B) . Consequently, after depletion of endogenous ROD-1, mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372) was no longer detectable at mitotic kinetochores, and, as predicted by RZZ's essential role at kinetochores, dividing embryos exhibited chromosome bridges in anaphase and were inviable (Fig. 5B, C) . We conclude that ROD-1's propensity to oligomerize into filaments is antagonized by its N-terminal b-propeller. The behavior of C. elegans ROD-1(D1-372) was unexpected given that human ROD(D1-375) prevented kinetochore expansion. While the molecular basis for this difference is currently unclear, the experiments in human cells and C. elegans identify the Rod b-propeller as a key regulator of RZZ self-assembly. The ROD-1(D1-372) mutant also illustrates that cells must have tight regulatory mechanisms in place to control Rod's tendency to oligomerize.
Immunostaining confirmed that endogenously tagged 3xFLAG::CZW-1 Zw10 co-localized with mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372) on filaments (Fig. 5E ), while ZWL-1 Zwilch and SPDL-1 Spindly were not detectable ( Fig. S5B and data not shown). This agrees with prior work showing that CZW-1 Zw10 binds to ROD-1's Sec39 domain, which is present in ROD-1(D1-372), and that the ROD-1 bpropeller binds to ZWL-1 Zwilch and SPDL-1 Spindly [15, 32] . Unlike the GFP::ROD-1 filaments ( Fig.   4B ; Fig. S4 ), mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372) filaments never clustered at mitotic spindle poles and showed no evidence of directed movement (Fig. 5F ), consistent with the lack of SPDL-1 Spindly on these filaments.

KNL-3, NDC-80, and CENP-C also localized to the filaments, but to a lesser extent (data not shown). The association of kinetochore proteins with mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372) filaments was strictly limited to the -1 oocyte and meiosis I embryo (Fig. S5C ), implying that their recruitment is regulated by posttranslational modifications and/or as-yet-unknown meiosis-specific factors. These results demonstrate that ROD-1(D1-372) and CZW-1 Zw10 retain the ability to interact with other kinetochore proteins after assembly into higher-order oligomers.
A complex of ROD-1(D1-372) and CZW-1 Zw10 self-assembles efficiently into higher-order oligomers in vitro.
We next sought to exploit the unique behavior of the ROD-1(D1-372) mutant to dissect the molecular requirements for ROD-1 oligomerization. Depletion of CZW-1 Zw10 by RNAi completely suppressed filament formation of mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372) (Fig. 5H ), likely because CZW-1 Zw10 is essential for ROD-1 stability [15] . By contrast, mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372) filaments were not affected by depletion of ZWL-1 Zwilch or SPDL-1 Spindly , consistent with the observation that ZWL-1 Zwilch and SPDL-1 Spindly did not localize to filaments. Furthermore, mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372) filaments readily formed after depletion of KNL-1, BUB-1, the Mis12 complex subunit KNL-3, and NDC-80, as well as after depletion of the mitotic regulators ICP-1 INCENP , CDK-1, and PLK-1 (data not shown). This indicated that a complex of ROD-1(D1-372) and CZW-1 Zw10 may be both necessary and sufficient for efficient oligomerization into filaments. To directly test this idea, we expressed the full-length RZZ complex and the ROD-1(D1-372)-CZW-1 Zw10 complex in insect Sf21 cells using baculovirus (Fig. 6A ). For purification and visualization, ROD-1 was N-terminally tagged with 6xHis followed by GFP, and CZW-1 Zw10 contained an N-terminal StrepTagII. After a first affinity purification step with nickel resin, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that GFP::RZZ fractionated as a complex with equal stoichiometry of its three subunits and without other obvious protein contaminants (Fig. 6A ). After SEC, we examined the peak fractions by fluorescence microscopy but found no evidence that GFP::ROD-1 was present in filaments ( Fig.   6B ). We then applied the same purification procedure to the GFP::ROD-1(D1-372)-CZW-1 Zw10 complex, which we obtained in similar amounts and purity as GFP::RZZ (Fig. 6A) . In contrast to GFP::RZZ, GFP::ROD-1(D1-372)-CZW-1 Zw10 fractionated in a broader peak in SEC. Subsequent examination of peak fractions using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy revealed .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/282707 doi: bioRxiv preprint that GFP::ROD-1(D1-372) was present in filaments that were typically several µm in length (up to ~15 µm) and had an invariant width of ~50 nm (Fig. 6B -G) . Filaments frequently associated laterally with each other to form loose bundles (Fig. 6C , F, G). Staining for the StrepTagII confirmed that CZW-1 Zw10 co-localized with GFP::ROD-1(D1-372) on filaments (Fig. 6D) . We also readily obtained filaments with a ROD-1(D1-372)-CZW-1 Zw10 complex, confirming that the GFP tag was dispensable for ROD-1 oligomerization (Fig. S6 ). Once formed, filaments remained static and were stable at 4 ºC for several weeks, but did not tolerate freezing or high salt (500 mM NaCl), suggesting oligomerization involves electrostatic interactions. If the SEC step was omitted and partially purified GFP::ROD-1(D1-372)-CZW-1 Zw10 was examined directly after nickel affinity chromatography, filament formation could occasionally be followed by live imaging, which revealed that filaments grow from both ends (Fig. 6E) . We conclude that a purified ROD-1(D1-372)-CZW-1 Zw10 complex oligomerizes efficiently into µm-scale filaments in vitro, and that these filaments resemble those observed with this ROD-1 mutant in vivo. Thus, ROD-1(D1-372)-CZW-1 Zw10 represents a minimal RZZ construct sufficient for self-assembly into higher-order oligomers.

The RZZ complex is well-established as an outer kinetochore component required for the recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 and dynein [11, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Here, we present evidence that RZZ additionally functions as a structural precursor for the assembly of the dynamic outermost kinetochore domain, which expands in early prometaphase to accelerate spindle assembly [22] . Recent work has revealed that the RZZ subunit Rod is evolutionarily related to coat proteins that form higher order assemblies on membranes [16, 29] . We demonstrate in C. elegans that Rod proteins are also capable of selfassembly. Although additional components may be required in vivo, we show in vitro that a complex consisting of ROD-1 without its b-propeller and CZW-1 Zw10 is sufficient to form µm-scale filaments, which have an invariant diameter of ~50 nm. Based on the human RZZ structure [16] , the precursor of these filaments likely corresponds to a ROD-1(D1-372)-CZW-1 Zw10 dimer. Similarly, the precursor of the GFP::RZZ filaments we observe in vivo is likely a dimer of a trimer, containing two copies each of ROD-1, CZW-1 Zw10 , and ZWL-1 Zwilch . Deletion of the b-propeller greatly favors oligomerization of ROD-1 in vitro and in vivo. The ROD-1 b-propeller forms a tight complex with ZWL-1 Zwilch [15, 32] , raising the possibility that the presence of ZWL-1 Zwilch in RZZ has an inhibitory effect on self-assembly.
However, depletion of ZWL-1 Zwilch in animals expressing mCherry::ROD-1 does not result in the ubiquitous formation of filaments we observe with mCherry::ROD-1(D1-372) [15] .
This argues that the inhibitory effect of the ROD-1 b-propeller on RZZ self-assembly is direct. The extent to which CZW-1 Zw10 contributes to self-assembly is difficult to assess, because CZW-1 Zw10 is essential for the stability of ROD-1 [15] . Future work may reveal the spatial arrangement of precursors within ROD-1(D1-372)-CZW-1 Zw10 filaments and provide insight into the self-assembly mechanism.
Based on our analysis of C. elegans RZZ, we suggest that human ROD's central role in kinetochore expansion is directly related to its capacity for oligomerization. We envision that filamentous RZZ assemblies form the structural scaffold of the expanded kinetochore domain and function as dynamic recruitment platforms for corona proteins, including SAC components, the motors dynein and CENP-E, and CENP-F. In contrast to the KMN network, protein-protein interactions among components in the expanded outer domain are low-affinity and therefore challenging to dissect with biochemical approaches.
Our finding that the expanded domain can be fully detached from the underlying . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/282707 doi: bioRxiv preprint kinetochore, either by acute CDK1 inhibition or by combining GFP::ROD over-expression with Knl1 depletion, suggests that RZZ-dependent expansion results in a distinct multiprotein assembly that is at least transiently stable without the KMN network. Consistent with recent studies [13, 17] , our findings imply that kinetochores contain two distinct pools of Mad1-Mad2: one pool recruited by the KMN network through a direct interaction with Bub1 [7] [8] [9] , and another pool localized to the expanded outer domain, most likely recruited through a direct interaction with RZZ. The presence of BUBR1 and BUB3 on detached crescents may indicate that the expanded domain is able to generate MCC independently of BUB1.
Given RZZ's propensity to form oligomeric assemblies, an important question is how this behavior is spatially restricted to kinetochores. Our observations in C. elegans embryos expressing endogenous GFP::RZZ show that local precursor concentration is a critical parameter governing oligomerization behavior. Specifically, analysis of GFP::RZZ filament formation suggests that the complex is refractory to oligomerization until a threshold density of precursors is achieved. This may in part explain why we failed to observe filaments with GFP::RZZ in vitro, as the concentrations we obtained in the preparations were relatively low. In the context of kinetochores, recruitment of RZZ by Knl-1-Bub1 could bring about the spatial proximity of RZZ precursors necessary to trigger oligomerization, which then proceeds autonomously. An important implication of the mechanism we propose is that self-recruitment contributes significantly to overall RZZ levels at unattached kinetochores. Thus, even low levels of Knl1-Bub1 may support kinetochore expansion, so long as a minimal number of RZZ precursors can be recruited to start filament assembly. This idea is consistent with the observation that kinetochores are able to expand in GFP::ROD-expressing cells depleted of KNL1. While Knl1-Bub1 appear to be dispensable for expansion per se, our results in GFP::ROD-expressing cells show that Knl1-Bub1 are required for the physical linkage between the expanded domain and the underlying kinetochore.
We also show that RZZ's direct binding partner Spindly makes an important contribution to kinetochore expansion. This function of Spindly is separable from its function as the kinetochore adaptor for dynein-dynactin [15] , because DCTN1 depletion shows that dynein-dynactin are dispensable for kinetochore expansion. Previous work indicates that Spindly is recruited to kinetochores through a direct interaction with the ROD b-propeller [15, 16] , and, consistently, deletion of the ROD b-propeller suppresses .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/282707 doi: bioRxiv preprint kinetochore expansion [15] . However, the ZWILCH(E422A/D426A) mutant shows that Spindly recruitment by RZZ per se is not sufficient for kinetochore expansion. Work in C. elegans suggested that SPDL-1 Spindly , in addition to binding the ROD-1 b-propeller, also makes contact with ZWL-1 Zwilch [15] . The interaction between SPDL-1 Spindly and ZWL-1 Zwilch involves the conserved acidic residues we mutated in human ZWILCH, raising the possibility that an interaction between Spindly and ZWILCH may play role in RZZ selfassembly. Mitotic kinases have been implicated in the regulation of kinetochore expansion in Xenopus egg extracts [21] . It is therefore likely that kinetochore-localized kinase activity acts on RZZ and/or Spindly to promote self-assembly of RZZ. Mps1 is a particularly attractive candidate given that a recent study identified multiple Mps1-dependent phospho-sites on both Spindly and the ROD b-propeller [38] .
In summary, we propose that recruitment of RZZ to kinetochores by Knl1-Bub1 locally concentrates Rod to favor self-assembly. Aided by Spindly and possibly kinase activity, this generates RZZ-based filaments that engage weakly-associating corona proteins to form the supramolecular assemblies visible as crescents and fibrous coronas by light and electron microscopy, respectively. Disassembly of the expanded domain after end-on microtubule attachment is likely achieved by dynein-dependent poleward transport of corona proteins, a process that is well documented [11, [39] [40] [41] [42] . Indeed, failure to completely disassemble the corona may contribute to the partial retention of MAD1 at microtubule-attached kinetochores that is observed in human Spindly mutants deficient in dynein recruitment [43, 44] . Thus, RZZ not only helps build the expanded kinetochore but also recruits the motor that brings about its eventual compaction.

cDNA coding for residues 1-591 of wild-type ZWILCH and the ZWILCH mutant E422A/D426A were cloned into a pcDNA5/FRT/TO-based vector (Invitrogen) modified to contain N-terminal Myc-GFP-TEV-S-peptide. Point mutations were subsequently introduced to make the transgene resistant to siRNA. Stable isogenic HeLa Flp-In T-REx cell lines expressing ZWILCH were generated by FRT/Flp-mediated recombination, as described previously [15] .
Worm strains (Table S1 ) were maintained at 20 ºC on standard NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. To generate a strain stably expressing mCherry::ROD-1(373-2177) from chromosome II (locus ttTi5605), we used the same Mos1 transposon-based approach described previously for the strain expressing mCherry::ROD-1(1-2177) [15] .
Integration of the transgene was verified by PCR and sequencing. Endogenous GFP tagging of the rod-1 locus was done using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, as described [45] . The repair template for gfp::rod-1 included gfp(S65C) with introns, inserted upstream of the rod-1 start codon via a GGRAGS linker, and the homology arms (1046 bp left; 1036 bp right). The PAM site for the guide RNA (5'-CCACAGCTTTTGCTTCGCCT-3') was mutated from AGG to AGA in the repair template. To modify the rod-1 locus using Cas9-triggered homologous recombination, the repair template (50 ng/µL) was co-injected with two separate plasmids, one expressing guide RNA under the U6 promoter (50 ng/µL) and the other expressing Cas9 under the eft-3 promoter (30 ng/µL) into N2 worms [46] .
The injection mix also contained three plasmids encoding fluorescent markers [pCFJ90 (Pmyo-2::mCherry, 2.5 ng/µL), pCFJ104 (Pmyo-3::mCherry, 5 ng/µL) and pGH8 (Prab-3::mCherry, 10 ng/µL) that allowed selection for F1 transgenic animals. Progeny of F1 transgenic animals were screened for integration of gfp by PCR using a primer within gfp and a primer outside the left homology arm. Strains were outcrossed 6x with the wild-type N2 strain and other fluorescent markers were subsequently introduced by mating.

HeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 units/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco). For immunofluorescence, cells were seeded on 12-mm poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips in 12well plates 24 h prior to transfection with siRNAs. Cells were transfected with siRNAs (Dharmacon On-Target plus; Table S2 ) targeting ROD/KNTC1, DCTN1, KNL1/CASC5, ZWILCH, and SPDL1/CCDC99, as described previously [43] . An siRNA against luciferase was used as a control. Transgene expression (Fig. 1K -M; Fig. 2C; Fig. 3B -D; Fig. S2) was induced with 0.2 µg/mL tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich) 24 h post-transfection and cells were fixed 20 -24 h later. To depolymerize microtubules prior to immunofluorescence, cells were treated with 1 µM nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h. To detach kinetochore crescents from centromeres ( Fig. 2; Fig. S1 ), cells were incubated for 4 h with 1 µM nocodazole followed by a 30-min incubation with nocodazole and 10 µM CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 (Sigma-Aldrich).

Protein fractions were allowed to settle on 300 mesh Formvar-carbon-coated nickel grids and were negatively stained with a 2 % aqueous solution of uranyl acetate.
Grids were examined with a JEM1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL) operating at 120 kV. Images were acquired using a post-column high-resolution (11 megapixels) high-speed camera (SC1000 Orius, Gatan).
Image analysis was performed using Fiji software (Image J version 2.0.0-rc-56/1.51h).
Volume and intensity of kinetochore fluorescence for CENP-E, CENP-F, Spindly, and GFP were measured using the 3D Objects Counter tool. To each image stack (0.2µm z-steps) encompassing one cell, the Subtract Background function was applied (rolling ball radius of 5 pixels), and a mask was generated based on an empirically determined threshold that maximized the number of detected kinetochores, while minimizing the detection of false objects. The mask was re-directed to the original, unprocessed image stack to determine the number of voxels and the integrated intensity for each object, which could consist of one or several closely apposed kinetochores. Object values were then summed to give the total number of voxels and the total integrated intensity for kinetochores in the image stack. To determine background intensity, the number of voxels and integrated intensity were measured for five separate regions in the image stack that did not contain kinetochores. Values for the five regions were averaged, normalized to the total number of kinetochore voxels, and subtracted from the total integrated kinetochore intensity. The total number of kinetochores in the image stack was determined separately using the CENP-C signal after maximum intensity projection of the image stack, followed by thresholding, automatic particle counting, and verification by visual inspection. Finally, the total number of kinetochore voxels and the total integrated kinetochore intensity were divided by the total number of kinetochores to yield the average number of voxels and integrated intensity per kinetochore per cell. Average kinetochore volumes and integrated intensities were determined for 20 cells in two independent experiments.

The mean intensity in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm of the same cell was determined, and the mean intensity of a region outside the embryos (camera background) was subtracted.

05d47dd5b46f86428de058db4ecc8bca76a9ad16,,"The world is currently faced with a pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has no vaccine or cure. It is predicted the development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 will take one year to 18 months, by which time it is likely that several hundreds of thousands to millions of people may have been infected. With a rapidly growing number of cases and deaths around the world, this emerging threat requires a nimble and targeted means of protection. Since coronaviruses causing COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are able to suddenly transfer to humans from diverse animal hosts that act as viral reservoirs, there is a pressing need to develop methods to combat other potential coronaviruses that may emerge in the future [1] [2] [3] . A recent report further showed two strains (L and S) of SARS-CoV-2 with different genome sequences are circulating and likely evolving, further highlighting the need for a pan-coronavirus vaccination strategy 4 .
The novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 belongs to a family of positive-sense RNA viruses, which typically infect the upper and lower respiratory tracks and cause disease by direct cytotoxic effects and the induction of host cytokines disease 5 . The SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is likely similar to closely related coronaviruses such as the virus that causes SARS, in which the virus enters the cell, releases its RNA genome into the cytoplasm, and synthesizes negativesense genomic and subgenomic RNAs from which viral mRNAs and a new copy of the positive sense viral genome are synthesized (Fig. 1A) 6, 7 . Whereas traditional vaccines work by priming the human immune system to recognize viral proteins or weakened viruses and decrease viral entry into cells 8 , the alternative antiviral approach we propose here relies on a CRISPR-based system for recognizing and degrading the intracellular viral genome and its resulting viral mRNAs (Fig. 1B) . Targeting the positive-sense genome and viral mRNAs to simultaneously degrade viral genome templates for replication and viral gene expression would be expected to robustly limit viral replication.
To inhibit RNA viruses in human cells, we used the CRISPR-Cas13d system derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens XPD3002, a recently discovered RNA-guided RNA endonuclease 9, 10 . Cas13d employs CRISPR-associated RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a customizable 22 nucleotide (nt) spacer sequence that can direct the Cas13d protein to specific RNA molecules for targeted RNA degradation. The high catalytic activity of Cas13d in mammalian cells provides a potential mechanism for targeting SARS-CoV-2 for specific viral RNA genome degradation and viral gene expression inhibition. Because of its small size (967 amino acids), high specificity, and strong catalytic activity, we chose Cas13d rather than other Cas13 proteins to target and destroy RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus (IAV) [10] [11] [12] .
In this work, we developed a Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells (PAC-MAN) strategy as a form of genetic intervention to target SARS-CoV-2, IAV, and potentially all sequenced coronaviruses. We created a bioinformatic pipeline to define conserved regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and target these regions using CRISPR-Cas13d for viral genome degradation and viral gene inhibition. At the time of paper submission, there is no widely available laboratory strains of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we tested our approach using synthesized fragments of SARS-CoV-2, as well as with live H1N1 IAV. We designed and screened a panel of crRNA pools targeting conserved viral regions and defined the most effective crRNAs. We demonstrated the ability of our approach to cleave SARS-CoV-2 fragments and to reduce the replication of IAV in human lung epithelial cells. Our bioinformatics author/funder. All rights reserved.

Manuscript analysis revealed a group of six crRNAs that can target 91% of sequenced coronaviruses, as well as a group of 22 crRNAs able to target all sequenced coronaviruses. The potential pancoronavirus protection using CRISPR-Cas13d offers an alternative and complementary approach over traditional pharmaceuticals or vaccines. Through the use of crRNA pools targeting different regions of the same virus or different strains of coronavirus, this system could possibly buffer against viral evolution and escape, as well as enable rapid development and deployment against emerging viruses. When combined with an effective delivery platform, PAC-MAN is a promising strategy to combat not only coronaviruses including that causing COVID-19, but also a broad range of other genera of viruses. author/funder.

To create effective and specific crRNA sequences to target and cleave SARS-CoV-2, we first performed a bioinformatic analysis by aligning published SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 47 patients with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomes at the single-nucleotide resolution level. SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded RNA genome with ~30,000 nucleotides that encodes 12 putative, functional open reading frames [13] [14] [15] . Our analysis found regions with a high conservation between 47 SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomes ( Fig. 2A) . The two highly-conserved regions respectively contain the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene in the polypeptide ORF1ab region, which maintains the proliferation of all coronaviruses, and the Nucleocapsid (N) gene at the 3' end of the genome, which encodes the capsid protein for viral packaging.

To target highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 regions, we generated an in silico collection of all 3,802 possible crRNAs (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). After excluding crRNAs either predicted to have potential off-target binding (≤1 mismatch) in the human transcriptome or having poly-T (≥4 Ts) sequences that may prevent crRNA expression, we obtained a collection of 3,203 crRNAs (Supplemental Table 1 ). We designed and synthesized 40 crRNAs, with 20 crRNAs each targeting the conserved sequences of the RdRP and N genes (Supplemental Table 2 ). Our rationale for densely targeting these two regions was to significantly reduce both viral genomic RNA and mRNA templates for expressing essential viral proteins and to minimize the risk of loss of targeting activity by mutational escape.
To evaluate whether Cas13d is effective for targeting SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we created two reporters expressing synthesized fragments of SARS-CoV-2 fused to GFP (SARS-CoV-2-F1 and SARS-CoV-2-F2; Fig. 2B , Supplemental Table 3 ). As SARS-CoV-2 appears to mainly infect respiratory tract cells in patients 5 , we chose to use human lung epithelial A549 cells as a model cell line. We created a stable A549 cell line expressing Cas13d through lentiviral infection, followed by sorting for the mCherry marker that was co-expressed with Cas13d ( Fig.  2C) .
We first investigated which regions of the SARS-CoV-2 fragments were most susceptible to Cas13d-mediated targeting and cleavage. To do this, we transfected or transduced the SARS-CoV-2 reporters into Cas13d A549 cells that had been transduced with pools of four crRNAs targeting either RdRP or N gene regions (Fig. 2D , see Methods). We chose to evaluate the effectiveness of our system using a pool of crRNAs, since in the context of live viral infection, this would prevent the possibility of escape from inhibition due to a mutation involving a single crRNA target site. A total of ten groups (G1-G10) were tested for all 40 crRNAs (Supplemental Table 2 ). Twenty-four hours after SARS-CoV-2 reporter transfection, we performed flow cytometry to examine levels of GFP protein expression and collected RNA from cells to perform quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine mRNA transcript abundance.
We observed that most RdRP-targeting crRNA pools were able to repress reporter expression to some extent compared to the control, and one pool targeting the middle of the SARS-CoV-2- Table 2 for the designed crRNA sequences and Supplemental Table 3 author/funder.

Manuscript F1 RdRP region (G4; SARS-CoV-2 genome coordinates 13,784-14,149) was able to repress GFP by 86% (p = 2x10 -6 ) (Fig. 3A, S2A -B, Supplemental Table 4 ). One pool of N genetargeting crRNAs (G8; SARS-CoV-2 genome coordinates 28,803-29,034) was able to substantially repress SARS-CoV-2-F2 GFP, causing a 71% decrease in expression (p = 2x10 -7 ) (Fig. 3B, S2A -B, Supplemental Table S4 ). Our qRT-PCR analysis showed consistent results at the RNA level, with G4 and G8 inhibiting their respective reporter mRNA abundance by 83% (p = 3x10 -11 ) and 79% (p = 2x10 -12 ) ( Fig. 3A -B, Supplemental Table S4 ). The variations in the ability of different crRNA pools to repress the SARS-CoV-2 reporters are likely due to RNA secondary structure inherent in the SARS-CoV-2 genome or differences in binding affinities for each crRNA sequence composition.

We next independently validated the performance of adjacent crRNA pools when SARS-CoV-2-F1 or -F2 was introduced via lentiviral transduction. We argue that this approach, in which the lentivirus-derived RNA serves as a PAC-MAN target prior to lentivirus integration into DNA, mimics the crRNA targeting conditions that would apply for natural COVID-19 infection. We tested on a few selected crRNA pools, including the 3 best groups G4, G5, and G8 and one less efficient group G1, with a lentiviral multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. Our results revealed similar patterns to our SARS-CoV-2 transfection experiments, with the best groups (G4, G5, G8) able to repress their reporters by 69%, 71%, and 60% (p = 7x10 -6 , 10 -3 , 3x10 -6 for G4, G5, G8, respectively) (Fig. 3C) . qRT-PCR analysis also showed consistent results, with G4, G5, and G8 repressing 70%, 68%, and 49% of RNA abundance (p = 8x10 -8 , 4x10 -6 , 10 -4 for G4, G5, G8 respectively) (Fig. 3D) .
We further validated the effectiveness of Cas13d-mediated repression of SARS-CoV-2 reporters by co-transfecting each reporter with a pool of 5 crRNAs tiled along the whole fragment, compared to a pool of 5 non-targeting control crRNAs (Table S2) . We found that the RdRPtargeting crRNAs were able to repress SARS-CoV-2-F1 GFP by 81% (p = 0.01), while Ntargeting crRNAs were able to repress SARS-CoV-2-F2 GFP by 90% (p = 5x10 -4 ) (Fig. 3E,  S3A) . We also did an analysis of the extent to which expression of Cas13d or crRNAs affected SARS-CoV-2 GFP reporter inhibition. Our analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition was more sensitive to crRNA concentration in our samples, while lower Cas13d expression only moderately decreased inhibitory activity (Fig. S3B) . Thus, maintaining a high level of crRNA concentration is likely a determining factor for more effective SARS-CoV-2 sequence targeting and cleavage.
These data together suggest: 1) Cas13d PAC-MAN can be an effective system to target and degrade SARS-CoV-2 sequences in human cells and 2) proper design of crRNAs are important for obtaining a high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.
Since we do not yet have access to live SARS-CoV-2 virus, as a proof-of-concept we elected to test the CRISPR-Cas13d strategy on inhibiting H1N1 IAV, a RNA virus with a similar tropism as SARS-CoV-2 for respiratory tract epithelial cells. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, which has only a single, continuous RNA genome, the IAV genome is contained in 8 negative-sense RNA segments, in which each plays an important role in packaging the viral RNA into budding virions 16, 17 .
To create crRNAs targeting a broad range of IAV strains, we aligned all complete IAV genomes retrieved from the Influenza Research Database and searched for the most conserved regions (Supplemental Table 5 ). Our analysis and the work of others showed that the segment ends are highly conserved for all 8 segments [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The segment ends are potentially attractive regions for targeting with Cas13d because of the potential to inhibit a broad range of IAV strains and because of the previous evidence that interfering with the packaging of one segment encoded on the segment ends can decrease the packaging efficiency of other segments and overall virion packaging 18, [22] [23] [24] [25] . Using sequence representation from ~140 different strains of influenza, we designed crRNAs that could be robust across as many different IAV strains as possible. Our bioinformatics analysis resulted in 6 crRNAs targeting highly conserved genome regions for each of the 8 IAV segments, for a total of 48 crRNAs (Supplemental Table 6 ).

To test the efficiency of IAV-targeting crRNAs, we performed a screen of our crRNA pools in the stable Cas13d A549 cell line to determine which were most effective at inhibiting IAV infection (Fig. 4A) . To do this, we transfected a pool of 6 crRNAs targeting a given IAV genome segment. Two days after crRNA transfection, the Cas13d A549 cells were challenged with PR8-mNeon, a strain of H1N1 IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) engineered to express the mNeonGreen gene, a fluorescent reporter protein (hereafter referred to as PR8-mNeon) at an MOI of 2.5 or 5.0 [26] [27] [28] . At approximately 18 hours post-challenge, the cells were analyzed for IAV infection through flow cytometry and microscopy. We examined the percentage of cells that were mNeon positive for each segment-targeting crRNA pool and calculated the fold-change compared to cells transfected with a pool of non-targeting crRNAs). Out of all crRNAs, the crRNA pool targeting segment 6 (S6) delivered the most consistent and robust results across different MOIs (72% reduction for MOI = 2.5 and 52% reduction for MOI = 5; Fig. 4B, S4) . Additionally, the segment 4 (S4) pool also showed moderate but consistent inhibition. To verify Cas13d-mediated inhibitory effects on S4 and S6, we further tested at a lower MOI of 0.5, which showed better inhibition of IAV across samples (e.g., 79% reduction using crRNAs targeting S6; Fig. S5 ). This confirms consistent inhibitory activity of IAV by Cas13d when targeting these two segments. There is a possible trend of greater inhibition at lower viral titers, suggesting that Cas13d PAC-MAN could be a particularly effective strategy for prevention of new infections, which typically occurs from exposure to a low level of virus.
We further characterized the S6-targeting crRNA pool. S6 encodes the gene neuraminidase (NA), which releases budding virions from the host cell 16 . We performed microscopy quantification of mNeon+ cells and found that mNeon expression was reduced by 62% (p = 10 -5 ) and 73% (p = 5x10 -9 ) with an MOI of 2.5 and 5, respectively, with S6-targeting crRNAs (Fig. 4C) and this trend was corroborated by flow cytometry (Fig. 4D) . Together, our data show that Cas13d PAC-MAN is able to target highly conserved viral regions and robustly inhibit viral replication in human lung epithelial cells.
In the past two decades, multiple variants of coronavirus, including those causing COVID-19, SARS and MERS, emerged from animal reservoirs and infected humans, each time causing significant disease and fatalities 1-3 . Thus, the design of a strategy that could broadly prevent and target viral threats, including all coronavirus strains that currently reside in animals, would be a valuable resource. We asked whether it is possible to design a minimal number of crRNAs that could target a majority of known coronaviruses found in both humans and animals.
To do this, we analyzed all known coronavirus genomes (3,051) to identify all possible crRNAs that can target each of those genomes, ending up with approximately 6.48 million possible crRNAs (Fig. 5A, S6) . We then refined our list to define the smallest number of crRNAs that could target all known coronavirus genomes with zero mismatches. We found that just two crRNAs could target ~50% of coronavirus genomes, including those causing COVID-19, SARS, and MERS; 6 crRNAs were able to target ~91% of coronavirus genomes; and 22 crRNAs covered all sequenced coronaviruses with no mismatches (Fig. 5B, Supplemental Table 7 ). The ability to use a relatively small number of crRNAs to broadly target most or all coronavirus strains further highlights the uniqueness of our approach in contrast to traditional pharmaceutical or vaccination approaches.
As a resource, we provide a map to show how our top 6 crRNAs (PAC-MAN-T6) targeted the coronavirus phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5A, red box) . Beta coronaviruses, the genus of viruses causing COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, were mostly covered by 3 crRNAs (crRNA 1-3) , while the other genera were covered by these three plus the remaining 3 crRNAs. Altogether, the PAC-MAN-T6 can target all known human coronavirus with broad coverage against other animal coronaviruses.
The minimal set of six crRNAs also included one crRNA (designated crRNA-N18f) that we validated. A recent work analyzed 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and indicated that there are two major types (L and S) of SARS-CoV-2 existing with different viral signature sequences 4 . To verify whether crRNA-N18f can target all L and S strains, we retrieved a set of 202 recently sequenced SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data author/funder.

(GISAID). Notably, crRNA-N18f targets all 201 genomes, with only one SARS-CoV-2 sequence carrying a single mismatch mutation (Supplemental Table 8 ). This suggests that our approach can robustly target multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains, but also suggests the potential need to use a pool of crRNAs to avoid mutational escapes. author/funder.

CRISPR-Cas13 emerged as a natural bacterial defense against bacteriophages, a powerful antiviral system that is able to use sequence-specific crRNAs to protect host bacterial cells from infections 29 . Here, we have repurposed the RNA-guided RNA endonuclease activity of Cas13d in mammalian cells against emergent viral targets, SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, in our PAC-MAN strategy. This expands the applications of CRISPR-Cas13 systems in addition to their uses for diagnostics such as SHERLOCK and live-cell imaging [30] [31] [32] [33] . Prior work showed Cas13a/b systems could inhibit ssRNA viruses including influenza, which is consistent with our observed high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 reporter and IAV inhibition using the PAC-MAN approach 31 . We demonstrated that Cas13d-based genetic targeting can effectively target and cleave the RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 fragments and IAV in lung epithelial cell cultures. Our bioinformatics analysis also suggested a minimal pool of 6 crRNAs able to target over 90% of sequenced coronaviruses. While this strategy is a proof-of-concept and will require further testing using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and validation in animal models before clinical tests in humans, it represents a unique approach to implement a rapid and broad antiviral defense in humans against emerging pathogens for which there are no effective vaccines.
For both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, we found highly conserved regions of the viral genomes to target with Cas13d. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these genome regions encode the RdRP and Nucleocapsid proteins, which are essential for coronavirus replication and function 13, 34 . RdRP is responsible for catalyzing the replication of all viral mRNAs and Nucleocapsid binds to genomic RNA, protecting it and serving as one of the two main structural proteins in virions. Targeted inhibition of these proteins could have an outsized effect on disabling virus production and function, in addition to reducing viral load through degradation of the viral genome itself. For IAV, the crRNAs that showed the best viral inhibition target the conserved ends of the segment S6 that encodes Neuraminidase (NA), a viral surface protein essential for mediating budding of new virions 35 . Prior mutation analysis has shown that mutating the packaging signals of one segment end leads to decreased packaging of other segments, indicating that there is a cooperative mechanism for packaging the IAV genome 18 . Thus, by inhibiting a single IAV genome segment, we could reduce the overall packaging of IAV in a synergistic fashion.
Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP gene and IAV NA gene that we targeted in our study are also the targets of two antiviral drugs, Remdesivir and Oseltamivir. Remdesivir, created by Gilead Sciences (development code GS-5734), is an RdRP inhibitor that was developed to treat Ebola and Marburg virus infections and has been reported to have antiviral activity against MERS and SARS 36-38 . Remdesivir is already administered for COVID-19 through compassionate use requests, and clinical trials for its use against COVID-19 have already started in the U.S.
(clinical trial ID NCT04280705) and China. Oseltamivir (also known as Tamiflu), is an antiviral medication for treating and preventing IAV that acts as an inhibitor of NA, thereby preventing the egress of new viral particles 39 . It will be interesting to see if these drugs could be used in combination with Cas13d PAC-MAN to synergistically cripple viral function and replication.
While we demonstrate that the PAC-MAN system is able to exhibit strong repression of viral sequences in an in vitro setting, it must be coupled with an effective in vivo delivery system for therapeutic use. There are several potential strategies that could be employed for transient in vivo expression of CRISPR components. Cas13d and its cognate crRNAs could be delivered as RNAs within polymers or lipid nanoparticles, perhaps with chemical alterations to increase stability 40 . In addition, a DNA-based liposomal delivery strategy, such as the recently developed HEDGES platform is also attractive 41 . Yet another strategy would be to deliver a author/funder.

Manuscript 13 ribonucleoprotein complex containing purified Cas13d assembled with crRNAs 42, 43 . All of these could potentially be used both as a therapeutic and as a prophylactic measure.
If the delivery barriers are overcome and a strategy like this is able to be used therapeutically, there are many potential benefits over traditional vaccines. Traditional vaccines rely on priming the immune system through exposure to viral proteins or peptides often derived from surface proteins that exhibit a high rate of mutation, which increased the chances of viral evasion of the host immune response 44 . In contrast, here we have demonstrated a genetic strategy that is able to target highly conserved regions, which would be expected to make it much more unlikely for the virus to escape inhibition through mutation. In addition, the ability of Cas13d to process its own crRNAs from a crRNA array means that multiple crRNAs targeting different regions (e.g. Fig. 3E , and PAC-MAN-T6 in Fig. 5A ) could be delivered simultaneously 9 , further reducing the chances of viral escape. As a further advantage, we demonstrate a potential pan-coronavirus strategy to target not only viruses that circulate in humans, but also those that currently are found in animal reservoirs that might transfer to humans to cause disease. If the crRNAs targeting these viruses can be tested and validated before they ever infect humans, we can greatly accelerate the development of countermeasures for future emergent threats.
In summary, our PAC-MAN strategy represents a potentially powerful new approach for inhibiting viral function and replication, and we envision it could be useful for a diverse array of circulating and emergent viral threats.
47 complete SARS-CoV-2 assemblies were downloaded from (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/2019-ncov-seqs/) on February 21, 2020. All the other 3,108 Coronavirinae complete genome sequences were downloaded from ViPR (Virus Pathogen Resource) database on February 21, 2020. After excluding very short genomes, we collected in total 3,051 Coronavirinae virus genomes. 202 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were downloaded from GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data; https://www.gisaid.org/).
We developed a full computational workflow to design crRNAs for the Cas13d system. To design all possible crRNAs for the three pathogenic RNA viruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV), the reference genomes of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, along with SARS-CoV-2 genomes derived from 47 patients were first aligned by MAFFT using the --auto flag. crRNA candidates were identified by using a sliding window to extract all 22 nt sequences with perfect identity among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We annotated each crRNA candidate with the number of mismatches relative to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomes, as well as the GC content. 3,802 crRNA candidates were selected with perfect match against the 47 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and with ≤1 mismatch to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV sequences. To characterize the specificity of 22nt crRNAs, we ensured that crRNA do not target any sequences in the human transcriptome. We used Bowtie 1.2.2 to align crRNAs to the human transcriptome (HG38; including non-coding RNA) and removed crRNAs that mapped to the human transcriptome with fewer than 2 mismatches.
We maximized the vertical coverage of pooled crRNAs to target a maximal set of the 3,051 Coronavirinae viruses with a minimal set of crRNAs. A sliding window was used to extract all unique 22 nt sequences in the Coronavirinae genomes, yielding 6,480,955 unique crRNA candidates. A hash table was used to map each crRNA candidate to the number of Coronavirinae genomes that it targets with a perfect match. A greedy algorithm was used to identify a minimal set of covering crRNAs. In each iteration, the crRNAs were sorted in descending order by the number of genomes targeted. The crRNA that targeted the most genomes was added to the minimal set of crRNAs, and all of the genomes it targeted were removed from the hash table values. If multiple crRNAs were tied for targeting the most genomes, the crRNAs were ranked by the length and quantity of stretches of repeated nucleotides, and the lowest ranking crRNA (i.e. the one with the fewest, shortest stretches of repeated nucleotides) was added to the set of minimal crRNAs. Using this approach, a set of 22 crRNAs was identified that was able to target all 3150 Coronavirinae virus genomes (including 47 SARS-CoV-2). The phylogenetic tree and the associated annotations were generated by the Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL v5.5; https://itol.embl.de/).
All the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were aligned with the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV NCBI Refseq sequences by MAFFT using the --auto flag. The alignment was visualized using the Geneious Prime software (Geneious 2020.0.4; https://www.geneious.com).

A consensus nucleotide (which is shared by >50% of non-gap characters at the given position) was assigned to each position in the alignment. Not every position has a consensus nucleotide.
The percent conservation at each position was calculated as the percentage of sequences matching the consensus at that position. To aid interpretation, the resulting plot of percentage conservation was smoothed using a moving average with a window size of 1,001 bp centered at each position. Positions corresponding to gap characters in the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence were omitted.
The crRNA plasmids were cloned using standard restriction-ligation cloning. Forward and reverse oligos for each spacer (IDT) were annealed and inserted into backbone using T4 DNA Ligase (NEB). Assembled oligos were either inserted into a pHR or pUC19 backbone, obtained and modified from Addgene (#121514 and #109054, respectively). Spacer sequences for all crRNAs can be found in Supplemental Table 2 and 6.
To clone SARS-CoV-2 reporters, pHR-PGK-scFv GCN4-sfGFP (pSLQ1711) was digested with EcoR1 and Sbf1 and gel purified. The PGK promoter and sfGFP were PCR amplified from pSLQ1711 and gel purified. The SARS-CoV-2-F1 and SARS-CoV-2-F2 fragments were synthesize from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). At last, the PGK, sfGFP, and SARS-CoV-2-F1/F2 fragments were inserted into the linearized pSLQ1711 vector using In-Fusion cloning (Takara Bio).
On day 1, one confluent 100mm dish (Corning) of HEK293T cells were seeded into three 150mm dishes (Corning). On day 2, cells were ~50-70% confluent at the time of transfection. For A549 cells, lentivirus precipitation solution (Alstem) was added and precipitated as per the manufacturer's protocol. One well of a 6-well plate (Corning) of A549 cells at ~50% confluency were transduced with the precipitated lentivirus. After 2-3 days of growth, the cell supernatant containing virus was removed and the cells were expanded. Cells were then sorted for mCherry+ cells using a Sony SH800S cell sorter. Table S2 ). On day 3, cells were switched to fresh medium with Puromycin at 2 ug/mL. Twenty-four hours after Puromycin selection, cells with transfected crRNAs were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 reporter plasmids or SARS-CoV-2 reporter lentivirus. Twenty-four hours after transfection or 48 hours after transduction, cells were tested using flow cytometry on a Beckman-Coulter CytoFLEX S and qRT-PCR on a Biorad author/funder. All rights reserved.

The PR8 mNeon IAV was generated by insertion of the mNeon fluorescent gene into segment 4 of the H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 strain (Nicholas Heaton's Lab, Duke University) as previously described . The PR8-mNeon virus was propagated in chicken eggs, and harvested allantoic fluid containing the virus was titered using MDCK plaque assays, and frozen in aliquots for later use.
3.1x10 6 Cas13d A549 cells were plated in two 100 mm dishes. The following day, the cells were transfected with 15 μg pooled crRNAs targeting the IAV genome or non-targeting controls (Supplemental Table 6 ) in 1.5 mL Opti-MEM reduced serum media and 30 μL Mirus LT1 reagent. After approximately 24 hours, the transfected Cas13d A549 cells were dissociated and re-plated in 24-well plates at a density of 15-20,000 cells/well and incubated overnight. Flow cytometry was performed on excess cells to quantify the transfection efficiency. Cells were challenged overnight with mNeonGreen expressing H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 at an MOI of 2.5 and 5. Uninfected cells were included as a negative control. An independent two-tailed T test was used to calculate the p values and statistics in Fig. 4C-D. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Real-time qRT-PCR was performed to quantify RNA abundance. For each sample, total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen Cat# 74134), followed by cDNA synthesis using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, Cat# 1708890). qRT-PCR primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Quantitative PCR was performed using the PrimePCR assay with the SYBR Green Master Mix (BioRad), and run on a Biorad CFX384 realtime system (C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler), according to manufacturers' instructions. Cq values were used to quantify RNA abundance. The relative abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 fragments was normalized to a GAPDH internal control.
Microscopy for SARS-CoV-2 experiments was performed on a Nikon TiE inverted confocal microscope equipped with an Andor iXon Ultra-897 EM-CCD camera and 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm and 642 nm lasers, using the 20x PLAN APO air objective (NA = 0.75). Image were taken using NIS Elements version 4.60 software. Microscopy for IAV experiments was performed on a Keyence BZ-X810 microscope equipped with a GFP and Texas Red filter was used to obtain images with a 20X objective lens.
A549 cells that express Cas13d and are transfected with crRNAs and challenged with PR8 mNeon virus were washed with 1X PBS, treated with 1X Trypsin EDTA and fixed in 1.6% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes. Cells were washed with FACS buffer (1X PBS, 0.3% BSA, 1mM EDTA). BD Accuri C6 plus flow cytometer was used to collect raw data. Raw data were processed with Cytobank (BD) software.

05d99c07db59b6948e39bfa62c2cbbf62944059a,"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England.
We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China.
We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate.
We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for health-care capacity planning.","An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, recently renamed CoVID-19, was first reported from Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. During January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiple cities in China, and the first cases started appearing outside China. By the end of January 2020, 9,720 cases had been confirmed in China, with 106 confirmed cases outside China across 19 different countries (1) .
Epidemiological analysis of the outbreak was quickly used to start estimating epidemiologicallyrelevant parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the serial interval, the incubation period and the case fatality rate (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Initial estimates suggested that the reproduction number was between 2 and 3 and the case fatality rate was less than 4% (8) . Control of spread by contact tracing and isolation appears to be challenging, given what is currently known about the virus (9) .
Mathematical models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the possible course of an outbreak, given a set of underlying assumptions. Here, we adapt a metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales to capture the spread of CoVID-19 (10) . The aim is to provide predictions about the likely timing of the peak of the epidemic in England and Wales and spatial features of spread.
We use an existing national-scale stochastic metapopulation model of disease transmission in England and Wales. The model structure is based on the metapopulation model described in detail in Danon et al (2009) (10) . In this model, the population is divided into electoral wards. Because of the changes in data availability, we restricted the model to England and Wales, whereas the original model covered Great Britain.
Transmission between wards occurs via the daily movement of individuals. For each ward, we assume that individuals contribute to the force of infection in their ""home"" ward during the night and their ""work"" ward during the day. See Danon et al 2009 for further details (10) .
Data for population and movement of individuals come from the 2011 census of the United Kingdom. The population size of each of the 8,570 electoral wards is available directly from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) website. The number of individuals moving between locations is also available from the ONS website, but at the level of census output areas (OAs). We aggregated the data from OA level to electoral wards level. Spatial location of electoral ward centres are extracted from maps available from the ONS websites.
We use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Infectious-Recovered (SEIIR) model within each ward to capture the progression of disease within an individual (figure 1). Initial analyses used SARS-like parameters for the incubation period and infectious period, which now appear to differ from CoVID-19(4). Li et al (2020) analysed data on 425 cases reported in Wuhan in China and fitted a log-normal distribution to the incubation period, and a gamma distribution for the serial interval (2) .

We used two infectious states to represent a mildly symptomatic or prodromal period and a period with more pronounced symptoms. In the absence of data on the relative magnitude of these two infections states, we assumed the same length of time in each infectious state and assumed that each state was equally infectious. We sampled from each of the distributions 100 times independently (Table 1 ). 
The census data are used to initialise the population sizes within each of the 8,570 wards. At the start of the model, all individuals are assumed to be susceptible to infection with no 3 e .

We investigated a range of starting scenarios by seeding the infection in example wards London, Birmingham, Brighton, Sheffield and Cardiff. To seed infection in a ward, we move five individuals (non-commuters) from the susceptible compartment to the first infectious state.
We investigated the impact of a seasonally affected transmission rate, to capture potential decreased transmission during the summer months. We captured seasonal transmission by replacing the constant transmission rate with a time-varying transmission rate given by:
is the magnitude of the seasonal difference in transmission, ranging from
(maximum seasonality with no transmission at the peak of the summer).
From the model, we extracted the total number of infections per day, as the number of individuals in both of the Infectious states, and the number of infected wards per day as the total number of wards with at least one individual in one of the two Infectious states. The spatial growth of the epidemic in England and Wales was visualised using interactive maps. We estimated the timing of the epidemic peak from the aggregated epidemic curve and calculated 95% prediction intervals from the model simulations.
The model is coded in C and is available on github (http://github.com/ldanon/MetaWards). The data are freely available from the Office for National Statistics website, or can be downloaded with the code at the github repository.
We predict that, in the absence of any interventions, a disease with ""best-guess"" CoVID-19-like parameters will peak a median of 133 days (range 126 -147 days) following the start of personto-person transmission in England and Wales. Intrinsic model stochasticity is responsible for variation between model runs. Using exactly the same parameters and seeding the infection in the same initial wards resulted in a difference in peak timing of +/-10 days (figure 2). The attack rate for best-guess parameters had a median of 45799874 (81.67% range 81.64-81.69), with a peak incidence median 1,116,692.

The initial location of cases had some, but limited impact on the timing of the epidemic in England and Wales. Epidemics seeded in Brighton, London, Birmingham and Sheffield resulted in synchronised epidemics in England, reaching urban areas first followed by rural areas. Epidemics started in Cardiff had a slower time to peak but still resulted in a generalised outbreak.
Spatially, some disaggregation between England and Wales regions is observed. An outbreak starting in Brighton, (South East England) peaks in London and the South East first, and North East England, Yorkshire and Humber and Wales last, with a ten-day lag between regions ( Figure 3 ).
Model predictions are highly sensitive to parameter values and incorporating parameter uncertainty increases the variability of model predictions. In the absence of any control measures, all predictions resulted in epidemics that peaked within a year from the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales. Estimates of peak time ranged from 78 days to 241 days (Figure 4 ).

Assuming no difference in transmission rate during the year leads to a single large epidemic after approximately 4 months (June time if transmission starts in February), as above. With a 25% reduction in transmission the epidemic is smaller and peaks later, reducing the overall attack rate by 20%. A 50% reduction in transmission results in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. The attack rate is 10% less than a non-seasonal epidemic. A 75% reduction in transmission over the summer resulted in a delayed large outbreak, but with a similar attack rate. If transmission decreases to zero over the summer then the resulting outbreak is much reduced, with an attack rate of less than 1% ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ). .

We predict that, in the absence of control measures and with no seasonality in transmission, the introduction of CoVID-19 in England and Wales has the potential to result in a synchronised outbreak that peaks at around 4 months following the start of person-to-person transmission. Our findings suggest that the height of the epidemic and the attack rate is highly dependent on seasonality of transmission and that even small changes in transmission risk can lead to large changes in attack rate due to the spatial disaggregation of the population at risk.
A combination of control measures and seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the peak of the outbreak to the winter of 2020/21, with little effect on the final attack rate. If contact tracing and isolation efforts succeed in reducing transmission, but are unable to control the epidemic (9), an additional influx of severe CoVID-19 cases may exacerbate existing challenges with winter healthcare demand. A careful analysis of the impact of control measures on the timing of incidence of severe cases is warranted.
The strength of this model lies in the spatial heterogeneity which tempers transmission. As a comparison, an equivalent non-spatial model results in the epidemic peaking after 34 days, nearly four times faster than this spatial model, and would be unable to capture the interaction between spatial transmission and seasonality. The estimated total number of people infected in the spatial model is marginally smaller than for a non-spatial model, as the infection has the opportunity to die-out in local parts of the country. As the model framework was developed and published in 2009, it was possible to re-deploy the model for these new circumstances; developing such a model from scratch during an outbreak would be a significant challenge.
A key element missing from our model is morbidity, mortality and the treatment of cases. The model in its current form predicts the total number of infections in the community rather than diagnosed cases. Observations from China suggest that many cases have mild symptoms and that only around 5% of cases have been reported and diagnosed (3) . The parameter estimates we used from China appear to be substantially different to previous coronaviruses (6) . Should CoVID-19 continue spreading the UK it will become possible to get UK-specific parameter estimates and improve prediction accuracy.
As with all modelling, it is impossible to capture the full complexity of an epidemic. In this model, the major assumptions are that we have assumed that there is no change in behaviour during the course of the epidemic. In practice, as the epidemic starts spreading in England and Wales there may well be a systematic change in behaviour as was seen during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. We have not included any age-effects, such as differential mixing, susceptibility or infectiousness. That means that we are not able to investigate the impact of school closures or the impact of the summer holidays, which had a large impact on the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009.",A spatial model of CoVID-19 transmission in England and Wales: early spread and peak timing,medrxiv,10.1101/2020.02.12.20022566,,,medrvix,2020-02-14,Leon Danon; Ellen Brooks-Pollock; Mick Bailey; Matt J Keeling,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv
0624a12abfe85c8b5070850d912a2db4cd453236,"Long-read sequencing technologies are invaluable for determining complex RNA transcript architectures but are error-prone. Numerous ""hybrid correction"" algorithms have been developed for genomic data that correct long reads by exploiting the accuracy and depth of short reads sequenced from the same sample. These algorithms are not suited for correcting more complex transcriptome sequencing data.
We have created a novel algorithm called TALC (Transcription Aware Long Read Correction) which models changes in RNA expression and isoform representation in a weighted De-Bruijn graph to correct long reads from transcriptome studies. We show that transcription aware correction by TALC improves the accuracy of the whole spectrum of downstream RNA-seq applications and is thus necessary for transcriptome analyses that use long read technology.","Recent advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies have revealed that transcription is more pervasive (1) , more diverse (2) and more cryptic (3) than expected (4) (5) (6) . Given the major role that RNA processing plays in disease and normal biology, it is crucial to ascertain the existence of novel isoforms and to accurately quantify their abundance. Second generation RNA-seq technologies such as Illumina are well suited to the tasks of assessing gene expression levels and determining proximal exon connectivity. They produce numerous sequencing reads at a low cost ensuring sufficient representation of most transcripts. However, because the RNA or cDNA is fragmented during short RNA-seq protocols, long range connectivity can only be computationally inferred. These predictions based on short reads struggle to correctly identify transcript isoforms that contain multiple alternative exons (7) or that contain retained introns (8, 9) . In these cases, long-read (LR) sequencing technologies are invaluable because they can sequence entire molecules in one pass and thus capture long-range connectivity of complex isoforms.
LR technologies however produce less reads than short read (SR) sequencing approaches (10) for similar costs and have higher error rates. In many cases these higher error rates can prevent the correct identification of isoforms (11) (12) (13) . Although several alignment software (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) are optimized to handle these errors, their shortcomings confound transcript identification and annotation. Many reads cannot be aligned and regions
where the sequencing error rates are higher such as UTRs frequently produce ambiguous alignments. Secondly, they struggle to identify splice junctions, notably those flanking small structural variants such as small exons or alternative 5' and 3' splice sites. This impacts the evaluation of exon skipping events and worsens the quality of transcript assembly (12) . These drawbacks prompted the development of algorithms, referred to as hybrid methods (19) (20) (21) (22) , that take advantage of SR depth and accuracy to compensate LR shortcomings.
Numerous algorithms have been proposed to combine long and short reads into high-accuracy long reads (23) .
A first approach is to correct long reads by local consensus inferred from short read multi-alignments (24) (25) (26) (27) .
This strategy is generally slow and computationally intensive. More importantly, it tends to show poor performances over low-expressed regions, and a risk of bias toward major isoforms. Therefore, they may not be suitable for transcriptome and single cell datasets where isoform representation may vary considerably. In the second approach (28) (29) (30) (31) , short reads are considered as the fragments of a reference transcriptome, and roughly assembled using a graph structure, onto which long reads are aligned (32) . However, sequencing errors in SR datasets, complex transcript architectures and sequence duplicates often lead to extremely complex graph structures (33, 34 ) that elicit graph simplifications or exploration heuristics to keep computations tractable. Most hybrid correction algorithms were primarily intended to be applied to genomic data with the aim to improve the quality of genome assemblies. As such, they typically rely on assumptions that fit DNA-seq data properties and thus a linear reference genome. According to this, bifurcation nodes and tips (dead-ends in the graph) are assumed to originate mainly from sequencing errors and not transcript processing events. In addition, genome sequencing benefits from a relatively uniform read coverage and therefore the graph is simplified by discarding a priori all nodes whose count is below a user-defined threshold. The fact that these approaches are not adapted for RNA-seq data have been extensively discussed in previous works on transcript assembly (34) and short read correction (35, 36) and their impact on long read correction can be easily anticipated. RNA-seq data display highly uneven coverage, even across a same genomic location, thus the frequency of sequencing errors varies depending on the surrounding coverage depth. Tips may correspond to the start or end of a transcript and finally specific regions such as 3' ends of transcripts, are frequently under covered.
We have developed TALC for Transcription Aware long-read Correction which addresses RNA-seq data specificities by incorporating coverage analysis throughout the correction process. TALC considers transcript expression and the existence of isoforms to correct LRs. For the purpose of testing TALC, we generated Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing reads and Illumina short reads on an MCF10A human cell line and downloaded LR and SR data from the GM12878 human cell line and a Spike-In experiment. We demonstrate that after TALC correction, long reads map with higher sequence identity and with less errors in exon assembly than currently used methods. The gains observed following TALC were tested on simulated long reads as well as on real reads. Figure 1 illustrates the methodology behind TALC and highlights how it considers transcript abundance and architecture to correct long reads. The first step of TALC graph-based procedure is to consider short reads as a raw reference transcriptome by merging them through a weighted De-Bruijn Graph (DBG) structure (28, 32) , whose nodes represent k-mers. For each node, we record their k-mer abundance in the SR dataset. Thus, any sequence of transcripts expressed in the RNA-seq sample should appear as a unique path of the graph. The long read is corrected by finding the right sequence of nodes to which it corresponds in the DBG built from short reads. Paths corresponding to true transcripts should display consistent k-mer coverage except in regions where the existence of multiple isoforms may alter the coverage such as at splice junctions ( Figure 2) . We thus propose a method of graph exploration that considers k-mer count variation consistent with transcript abundance and isoform existence (adaptive count thresholding).
As in (28) , the LR sequence is first divided into solid regions (stretches of k-mers shared with the SRs) interspersed with weak regions (stretches of likely erroneous k-mers).
To crop background noise that frequently surround solid regions, we first estimate the frequency of k-mers resulting from sequencing errors in the SR. The count of k-mers containing a sequencing error in SR is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution whose mean should be less than the average noise level λ . An estimate of λ is taken as the average coverage depth across the LR multiplied by the per base error rate in SR, whose estimates were found to be higher in RNA-seq datasets than in genomic data, ranging from 1% to 3% (35) .
A robust estimate of the average depth is derived a priori from the shared k-mer counts: the 15% smallest and 10% highest counts are removed and the mean is calculated from all the remaining k-mers. K-mers whose count We then split solid regions into anchor points with contrasting k-mer coverage. To this end, we inspect the regions coverage and each k-mer at which an abrupt count variation is detected is selected (cf Competing paths section below). K-mers at the tips of a region are always selected, and additional k-mers may be picked so as to have at least three distinct anchor points per solid region.
Once the long read is anchored, the DBG is explored in-between any couple of consecutive anchors, in search for the error-free path matching the inner weak region.
In TALC, a path in the DBG is defined as an ordered list of connected k-mers (nodes) which are weighted by their number of occurrences in the SR dataset. When a k-mer is mapped to a LR, we attribute its weight to the mapped region of the LR and use the term coverage. Thus, when we speak of coverage of a LR, it is in effect the weight of the k-mer that mapped to that region.
Abrupt changes in the coverage depth can be caused by alternative splicing events, duplicate k-mers, or sequencing bias in SR. These abrupt changes are termed split-coverage.
Nodes in a DBG are either simple, which means there exists only one successor k-mer in the data, or admit at least two successors, and thus can be extended by several distinct paths. We will refer to them as bifurcation nodes. Exploration is implemented as a breadth-first approach where at each bifurcation, only the next nodes whose count is considered consistent with the coverage of the current path will be followed. More precisely, at a given step n0, the k-mers database is queried for the counts of its four possible successors: (nA, nC, nG, nT).
And we want to assess which of these make up valid extensions of the current path.
We need to infer two things: whether n0 is close to a split-coverage event, in which case the exploration might be split into several competing paths; and which nodes are likely erroneous and should be filtered-out. To this end, we use the following decision rules (cf: Supplementary Materials):
1) If there is only one non-zero k-mer, there is no decision to make.
2) If there are at least two non-zero k-mers, we postulate that most of the time, there is no real split coverage event at n0, so that its count provides a good estimate of the downstream coverage depth, from which both the correct successor (say nL) and a local noise threshold can be inferred.
Accordingly, allowing to the consistence of the coverage, we pose as a null model: When the counts (nA, nC, nG, nT) do not fit this null model, we infer the current bifurcation is due to a changepoint and the exploration is split into all downstream nodes. At each new node, the expected count and the noise level are thus re-estimated, allowing an adaptive filtering-out of erroneous k-mers. Therefore, a true path is expected to be mostly made of count-consistent nodes possibly with a few change-point nodes. And the more a path admits change-points the less likely it is to represent the sequence of a true transcript.

As opposed to LoRDEC (28) , all paths passing the test described above are explored in parallel by a breadth-first approach. When the number of parallel paths exceeds a specified threshold, an evaluation is performed: all on-going paths are compared to the LR sequence and the least similar ones are stopped. This allows a more local and gradual evaluation of the similarity between the paths and the long read and we believe it contributes to reduces the inclusion of small sequencing errors from the SRs into the LR.
All paths which successfully bridge both Solid Regions are scored by their edit distance with the LR. The most similar one is considered suitable for further validation. Its sequence is aligned against the LR's; if the percent identity score with the LR is higher than a user-specified threshold (by default 70%), we assume we have likely found the best candidate.
Compared to inner weak regions (flanked on both sides by a solid region), the correction of weak border regions (flanked only on one side by a solid region) raises additional problems. Firstly, there is no clear targeted anchor point at which to stop exploration. Secondly, UTR sequences often contain low complexity regions and duplicated k-mers, which leads to increased complexity in the DBG. Finally, borders of transcripts suffer from higher sequencing bias in short reads (notably in 3' ends of transcripts). The two last points make k-mer coverage more erratic and over dispersed. In certain cases, incomplete coverage UTR extremities (eg: rare longer UTR forms) can sometime prevent a full-length correction entirely. For these reasons, we rely more heavily on sequence length and similarity between the visited paths and the LR's to direct graph exploration across those regions. More exactly, graph exploration is monitored in a same manner as described above (cf:
Selective Exploration of the DBG) until the paths's length matches the border's length. When the number of consecutive errors exceeds a given threshold, the corresponding paths are stopped.
When there are no more branches to investigate (that is all possibilities have ended in dead-ends of the graph or have been stopped), the very last error-prone bases of all interrupted paths are trimmed (cf: Supplementary Materials). To elect the best border path, we first search for it among the paths that were at least as long as the portion of the read we are attempting to correct, despite the constraints on sequence similarity. We choose the one having the smallest edit distance with the LR, and the most consistent coverage if there are ex-aequo. If no long border path could be found, shorter paths are compared and the one with highest similarity to the LR is selected.
Paths in the DBG that successfully bridge two Solid Regions are first ranked according to their sequence similarity with the Weak Region's. The similarity is computed as the edit distance between sequences.
We notice that the exploration stage often provides several solution paths having the exact same alignment score (this occurs for example when there are variants in sub-sequences that have been inserted or deleted from the LR), so that we cannot decide between them based on sequence information only. In order to choose between these equally-scoring paths, we perform a second ranking using count variation: the path with the least changepoints wins.
We compared the corrections made by TALC with six other state of the art hybrid correctors: FMLRC (31), CoLoRMap (26), Jabba (29) , Hercules (27) , LoRDEC (28) and LSC (24) . We chose FMLRC, Jabba, LoRDEC and ColoRMap as they were found to be the top performers according to a recent benchmark on genomic data (37) . We added Hercules because it was a very recent method not yet benchmarked. We also included LSC for it is (with LoRDEC) currently applied in numerous transcriptomic studies combining long and short reads (38-41).
Though it was well suited for RNA-seq data, according to (42), we could not include NaS (43) as it depends on a third-party proprietary software (Newbler assembler) that is no longer available.
Several algorithms (eg: CoLoRMap, LSC and Jabba) exclude uncorrected reads from the final output file.
However, to allow a fair comparison with the other methods, we systematically added back all discarded raw sequences before evaluation.
All jobs were run using 15 CPUs with 512 gigabytes of available RAM. If a job was not finished after 1 week, it was terminated (Jabba failed to finish within a week and had to be finally remove from the analysis; as already observed in (27), LSC could not scale to the biggest size real LR datasets; Hercules is absent from several tests too, due to long running times and heavy computational requirements, chiefly in its short read alignment phase).
LoRDEC and TALC were run with the recommended size of k-mers set to 21 (28, 44) , and FMLRC with its default parameters.
To evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms, we made use of two publicly available and one in-house SR and LR matched real datasets. The first dataset comes from a MinION cDNA sequencing experiment of ERCC Mix1
Spike-Ins (45) . The second one is provided by the NA12878 consortium (4) By using real datasets with contrasting error models (cf: Supplementary Material) to compare these methods instead of a computationally generated one we are testing them in authentic conditions. However, the drawback of using real data is that it is impossible to measure precisely the number of good corrections performed because the entire repertoire of transcripts and their true abundance is unknown; there is no reference transcriptome that perfectly matches the MCF10A and GM12878 cells. For example, (4) reconstructed about 78 000 highconfidence isoforms from the GM12878 datasets and found that the majority were absent from reference databases (4, 46) .

To work around this problem, we used the (raw) LR data to measure the abundance of transcripts in MCF10A and GM12878 cells (Supplementary Materials). From this LR-derived transcriptome, we simulated long ONT reads that respect the error rates that we observed in the sequencing data. Thus, we have a dataset of reads that are derived from the MCF10A and GM12878 transcriptomes and for which we know the exact structure and abundance of each isoform. This enables us to evaluate performances on a simulated LR dataset derived from the MCF10A and GM12878 transcriptomes.
We wished to use the recently published evaluation tool, LC_EC_analyser (42) . Unfortunately, it does not scale to our real size datasets (seemingly because of AlignQC issues in memory management). Nonetheless, we used analogous criteria (see below). Scripts designed to perform our evaluation are avalaible at: https://gitlab.igh.cnrs.fr/lbroseus/TransAT.
To assess the behaviour and performance of the 7 correction methods, we computed multiple indicators that are summarized in Tables 1-3 and Supplementary tables 1-3. These indicators can be broken down into two categories: standard sequence quality indicators and transcriptome-specific indicators.
These include the base accuracy between the LR and the molecule from which the LR was generated, the various error rates (mismatches, insertions, deletions), and the percentage of primary alignments to the reference genome. They are common benchmarks for genomic data. In addition, we verified that the different correction algorithms were able to maintained the initial read length.
When evaluating correction methods on real data, performance metrics can be unintentionally skewed because the molecule that was sequenced is unknown. For example, a correction method that would simply replace a LR by a known transcript sequence to which it was most similar could obtain a high percentage of mapped reads and low error rates but would not correctly represent the sequenced transcriptome. Thus, to further evaluate the 7 correction methods in this paper, we computed two sets of transcriptome-specific indicators which are directed towards the two major applications of RNA-seq experiments: transcript-level quantification (11, 47) and isoform recovery (12) . For this we considered two types of data: a real ERCC Spike-In dataset and two simulated LR data mimicking the real MCF10A and GM12878 experiments. ERCC Spike-In data have known theoretical concentrations from which we could gauge how each correction method would impact transcript counts accuracy. Simulated LRs datasets mimicking the real MCF10A and GM12878 datasets both in terms of error-model and transcript-level expression (cf: Supplementary Material) allows us to extend our observations on ERCC data to more complex transcriptomes. Importantly, it gives us insight into the capacity of a hybrid corrector to preserve and clarify transcript structure at the read resolution. For measuring the impact of correction on structure and transcript assembly accuracies, we computed the proportion of (simulated) long reads whose transcript structure could be correctly elucidated by aligners and their ability to preserve true exon connectivity and to improve false ones (cf : Tables 2A and 2B) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.10.901728 doi: bioRxiv preprint
Our first measure of performance was the number of mapped reads following correction (Table 1) . This was evaluated for all 7 methods using three different aligners: Minimap2 (15), GMAP (14) and GraphMap (16) . For all three aligners, we kept default parameters suggested for ONT data by their respective authors. We chose Minimap2 and GraphMap as they were specifically designed for long mRNA reads and GMAP because it was considered the best splice-aware aligner for long RNA data according to a recent benchmark (48) . TALC shows consistently high mapping numbers regardless of the aligner used. It's closest competitor in this aspect, LoRDEC, has a high number of mapped reads with Minimap2 and GMAP but this drops to the lowest number of all methods with GraphMap. We noticed a similar trend at the gene-level assessment where LoRDEC correctly associated LRs with their gene of origin when Minimap2 or GMAP were used but was one of the worst performers with GraphMap (Supplementary Table 2A ). This can be explained by the rather high mismatch rate that remains after LoRDEC correction (partly due to the insertion of false SNPs from SRs sequencing errors, Supplementary Table 1C) .
Based on these alignments, we computed the base accuracy of corrected reads as in (47) 
Long read technologies are often used to determine entire transcript architecture including alternative start or end sites (49) . Hence, it is important that correction algorithms include a strategy to delimitate RNA read borders accurately. To compare the length of corrected sequences to the raw read, we calculated the relative distances between the raw and the corrected read length over all real datasets (cf: Supplementary Table and Supplementary Figure 1E) . Overall, the methods considered seem to control read length with an average 2% to 3% difference in length with the raw read. CoLoRMap was the only exception as we found that it extended reads with an additional 5%-13.61% which could cause the correction to drastically overextend the transcript borders.
LR technologies are able to capture the full connectivity between exons of transcripts. Although this does not necessarily require nucleotide resolution of the transcript, the error rate of current LR technologies is sufficiently high to confound exon connectivity analysis ( Figure 3A ). Here we define ""structural errors"" as the incorrect inclusion or deletion of an exon or the incorrect identification of exonic boundaries. We developed a method to systematically identify these errors ( Figure 3B and Supplementary Material) and evaluated the impact of LR correction methods on them. Because the mapping approach used to assign LRs to a given transcript may impact on structural errors we again tested three mapping approaches: mapping of LRs to a reference genome .

If these exons were already properly identified before correction, we say that they were preserved by the correction algorithm; if they were not, we say that they were clarified by the correction algorithm (Table 2B) .
Regardless of the mapping strategy, we found that TALC is systematically in the top two best algorithms and globally performs the best. Again, we notice that other algorithms may compete with TALC on specific criteria given specific aligners but their performance drops drastically in other conditions. For example, when using the Minimap2 aligner, LSC slightly outperforms TALC in preserving the number of properly assigned exons (99.3% versus 98.5% preserved exons) but is very poor at correcting exons that were initially incorrect (14.8% versus 56.6% clarified exons).
To our knowledge, there is no algorithm dedicated to long read transcript-level quantitation (11, 47) . The authors of (47) tested several strategies to assess whether Nanopore data were fit for quantification. We reproduced their approaches based on Salmon (Salmon quasi-mapping). When splice-aware genome alignment was applicable, we also tested the approach Minimap2+Salmon. For comparison, we added a third approach, independent of Salmon, and simply based on GraphMap transcript assignments. Quantitation was realised on real Spike-In data (transcript-level) and on simulated datasets (gene-level and transcript-level). On simulated data, this analysis suggests that read correction results in a significant overall improvement of gene-level quantification accuracy (cf: Supplementary Table 2A ), all correction methods providing a rather similar gain in accuracy. This observation seems to hold also at the transcript-level, when using Salmon quasi-mapping mode, both on simulated datasets (Supplementary Table 2B ) and real Spike-In data (cf: Table 3 ). But, surprisingly, a prior alignment step (using either Minimap2 or GraphMap) seem to level the estimates.
High error rates of long read sequencing technologies can substantially bias the assignment of reads to unique transcripts and can also introduce major structural errors in de novo transcript prediction. Consistent with a previous study (12) , we show that proper hybrid correction can provide significant improvement in the quality of downstream transcriptome analyses. However, all existing hybrid correction algorithms, designed originally to improve genome assembly, are not all suitable for RNA-seq data (42) .
We propose a hybrid correction method tailored to RNA sequencing that considers transcript abundance to detect the possible existence of splice junctions and correct RNA long reads. This information is used to guide the exploration of a graph structure by eliminating edges that are not consistent in terms of transcript abundance while simultaneously using an adaptive threshold to account for the existence of multiple transcript isoforms. By eliminating inconsistent nodes, TALC reduces the inclusion of false nucleotide variants present in short read . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

And by integrating coverage information, it can efficiently detect and account for the existence of multiple transcript isoforms.
We tested the efficiency of our approach on three real and two simulated datasets. Globally, TALC shows better correction than currently used methods both in base accuracy and alignment rates but more importantly it conserves the exon connectivity in transcripts. Although other state of the art correction algorithms compete with TALC on specific applications, they have clear deficiencies on other important criteria that we summarize here.
FMLRC was the fastest software included in our benchmark. Additionally, it does very well on base accuracy.
However, it showed poor performances over most transcript-specific measures. This behaviour may be due to its approach for filtering ""erroneous"" k-mers. The threshold is read-specific but is computed a priori from the median SR read coverage (31) . This likely deletes minor isoforms k-mers when the difference in coverage with the major isoform is high. In addition, we noticed that FMLRC tended to trim reads.
Although it has long running times on real size datasets (cf: Supplementary Table 3 TALC displayed a good capacity to improve sequence quality while preserving splicing variants and proved robust to all error profiles considered. In addition, it provided rather consistent results whatever the aligner that was usedacross all aligners. Overall, TALC is systematically amongst the best performers across all metrics seems fitted to improveand improves the quality of transcriptome assemblies.

Nanopore direct-RNA multiple assets in viral transcriptome research (61-64), TALC's capacity to correct the entire gamut of transcripts, and preserve the correct transcript structure may prove increasingly valuable.

Table 2A : Overall impact of hybrid correction methods on transcript structure (real SR data, simulated LR data). For each aligner, we consider all exons from the transcripts that generated the LR if the LR mapped to the correct gene (#Exons evaluated). We computed the proportion of exons that were correctly mapped (%Identified), and the fraction of full-length LRs for which all exons could be accurately identified (error-free structure). The set of exons that could be evaluated varies between tools as it depends on the reads that could be mapped to the correct gene of origin. An exon is considered as identified if its genomic position is fully overlapped and the exon boundaries recognized by the aligner differ by no more than 10 bp (4).

Table 2B : Improvement of hybrid correction methods on local transcript structure compared to raw data (real SR data, simulated LR data). To evaluate the improvement on exon identification, we computed the number of exons properly mapped in raw data that are still properly mapped after correction (number of exons preserved) and the number of exons missed by the aligner in the raw data that are properly assigned after correction (number of exons clarified). For each correction method, we only consider LRs that aligned to the correct genomic locus both in the raw and in the corrected data set.

Transcript expression levels were computed using three approaches: the first two are based on Salmon (57) and presented in (47) of the long read (green peaks). From the solid regions, TALC will then determine anchor points. These will be used as entry points into the DBG; regions between these anchor points are called weak regions and will be corrected. To extract anchor points from the solid regions TALC will first crop background noise that frequently surround solid regions (red cross). The second step in determining anchors is to search for sudden changes in coverage within a solid region. These changes may correspond to divergent transcript architectures and should be explored separately. Thus, a solid region will be split into as many anchors as there are changes in coverage.
Finally, to correct weak paths between anchors, TALC will explore consistent paths. TALC explores the DBG, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

When the exploration reaches a potential transcriptional event such as a splice site (red dot), the exploration will branch out to account for the existence of multiple isoforms with varying coverage.

January 2020 from China. In addition, infection cases have been reported from Thailand, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, France, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Vietnam, Canada and Nepal, indicating that the disease is a potential threat to the global health. 3 Sadly, the number is still growing rapidly and no drug has been approved to be effective. Therefore, it is urgent to discover and develop drugs to cure the disease.
Based on its function, the main protease (M pro ) or chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) 4 is suggested to be a potential drug target to combat 2019-nCov, which is highly conservable among coronaviruses. Sequence alignment revealed that the M pro of 2019-nCov shares 96% similarity with that of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) (Figure 1 ). Studies for identifying the inhibitors of 2019-nCov M pro were quickly performed for discovering and developing drugs against the disease. For example, Hualiang Jiang and collaborators identified 30 drugs and compounds as the M pro inhibitors via protein modelling and virtual screening, which is a rapid progress in the way to cope with the crisis. In addition, one of the 30 drugs/compounds, remdesivir, was also suggested to be potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov by Liu et al, 5 For finding more potential drugs as inhibitors of the protein, we modelled the 2019-nCov M pro structures using SARS M pro (PDB ID: 2GTB) as template and docked 1903 approved drugs against the model in this study. Fifteen drugs were selected based on the docking score and three dimensional (3D) similarity to available M pro inhibitors against other coronavirus. For validation, we modelled 10 additional new models of 2019-nCov M pro and docked the 15 drugs against the new models, which revealed that 6 drugs (nelfinavir, praziquantel, pitavastatin, perampanel, eszopiclone, and zopiclone) have good binding modes with the new models. Binding free energy calculation were then performed for 4 of the 6 drugs using MM/GBSA and SIE methods. Nelfinavir was identified as the best one with predicted binding free energies of -24.69±0.52 kcal/mol by MM/GBSA and -9.42±0.04 kcal/mol by SIE, respectively. Taking into account its high 3D similarity of binding mode to the known M pro inhibitor, we proposed that nelfinavir should be a potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov M pro .

In 1918, individuals infected with influenza typically passed on the virus to between 1 and 2 of their social contacts [1] . The same was true for those infected with Ebola virus during the 2014 outbreak in West Africa [2, 3] . Nevertheless, Ebola virus disease infected a tenth of one percent of the number of individuals believed to have been infected by the 1918 Influenza virus [4, 5] . While improvements in healthcare and public health measures, as well as changes in human behavior, partially explain the massive discrepancy between Ebola virus disease in 2014 and influenza in 1918 [6] , there is another critical difference between these two diseases: heterogeneity in the number secondary cases resulting from a single infected individual. Here, we demonstrate analytically that quantifying the variability in the number of secondary infections via contact tracing is critically important for quantifying the transmission risk of novel pathogens and further show how a lack of publicly available contact tracing data on cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) prevents the global public health community from determining the true pandemic risk of this novel virus.
The basic reproduction number of an epidemic, R 0 , is the expected number of secondary cases [7] , or infections, produced by a primary case over the course of their infectious period in a completely susceptible population [8] . It is a simple metric that is commonly used to describe the transmissibilty of emerging and endemic pathogens [9] . If R 0 = 2, one case turns to two, on average, and two turn to four as the epidemic grows. And if R 0 < 1, the epidemic will die out. However, we are seldom concerned with epidemics that emerge and quickly die out. To observe an epidemic requires some level of sustained transmission, i.e., R 0 > 1. Almost 100 years ago, pioneering work from Kermack and McKendrick [10] [11] [12] first demonstrated how to estimate the final size of an epidemic for a pathogen with R 0 > 1. Specifically, they consider a scenario such that:
1. the disease results in complete immunity or death, 2. all individuals are equally susceptible, 3. the disease is transmitted in a closed population, 4. contacts occur according to the law of mass-action, 5. and the population is large enough to justify a deterministic analysis. Under these assumptions, Kermack and McKendrick show that an epidemic with a given R 0 will infect a fixed fraction R(∞) of the susceptible population by solving
This solution describes a final outbreak size equal to 0 when R 0 ≤ 1 and increasing as 1 − exp(−R 0 ) when R 0 > 1. Therefore, a larger R 0 leads to a larger outbreak which infects the entire population in the limit R 0 → ∞. This direct relationship between R 0 and the final epidemic size is at the core of the conventional wisdom that a larger R 0 will cause a larger outbreak and small variations in R 0 can lead to vastly different total case counts. Unfortunately, the equation relating R 0 to final outbreak size from Kermack and McKendrick is only valid when all the above assumptions hold, which in practice is rarely the case. In fact, seemingly trivial violations of the above assumptions can lead to vastly different outbreak sizes even when R 0 is held constant. As a result, relying on R 0 alone is often misleading when comparing different pathogens or outbreaks of the same pathogen in different settings [13] [14] [15] . This is especially critical considering that most outbreaks are not shaped by the ""average"" individuals but rather by a minority of superspreading events [13, 16] . For example, public health officials are currently trying determine whether 2019-nCoV can be contained or whether it will cause a pandemic [17] . Despite numerous estimates of 2019-nCoV's R 0 (ranging from 1.5 to just under 4 [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] ), as we discussed above in the comparison of Ebola virus disease and 1918 influenza, whether-like SARS-2019-nCoV can be contained or-like 2009 H1N1-2019-nCoV will cause a pandemic depends largely on the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. Indeed, recent work modeling the effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation on preventing 2019-nCoV concluded that the probability of containing the outbreak was significantly lower if 2019-nCoV heterogeneity in secondary infections was low, like influenza, as compared to higher, like SARS [24] . To more fully quantify how heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections affects outbreak size, we turn towards network epidemiology and derive an equation for the total number of infected individuals using all moments of the distribution of secondary infections.
Random network theory allows us to relax some of assumptions made by Kermack and McKendrick, mainly to account for heterogeneity and stochasticity in the number of secondary infections caused by a given individual.
We first follow the analysis of Ref. [25] and define G 0 (x) as the probability generating function (PGF) of the degree distribution {p k } (number of contacts), i.e.
When following a random edge, we define the excess degree as the number of other edges around that node. Because an edge is k times more likely to reach a node of degree k than a node of degree 1, the excess degree distribution is generated by
where k is the average degree and acts as a normalisation constant, and G 0 (x) denotes the derivative of G 0 (x) with respect to x. We now assume that the network in question is the network of all edges that would transmit a disease if given the chance.
Consequently, G 1 (x) generates the number of secondary infections that individual nodes would cause if infected. And, if we infect a random node as the patient zero, its entire connected component (a maximal subset of nodes between which paths exists between all pairs of nodes) will be infected. To calculate the largest possible epidemic, we thus look for the size of the giant connected component (GCC).
To calculate the size of the GCC, we first look for the probability u that following a random edge leads to a node not part of the GCC. For that node to not be part of the GCC, all of its excess edges must also not lead to the GCC. This simple observation leads to the self-consistent equation
The size of the GCC is a fraction of the full population N that we will denote R(∞) because it corresponds to the potential, macroscopic, outbreak size. Noting that a node of degree k is not in the GCC with probability u k , R(∞) can be written as
because it contains all nodes except those with no edges leading to the GCC. This solution is exact in the limit of large population size.
The network approach naturally accounts for heterogeneity, meaning that some individuals will cause more infections than others. The network approach also accounts for stochasticity explicitly: Even with R 0 > 1, there is a probability 1 − R(∞) that patient zero lies outside of the giant outbreak and therefore only leads to a small outbreak that does not invade the population.
However, the analysis in terms of PGFs is obviously more involved than simply assuming mass-action mixing and solving Eq. (1). In fact, the PGF G 0 (x) requires a full distribution of secondary cases per primary case, which will in practice involve a polynomial of high order.
To clarify and potentially simplify the approach, we propose to reformulate the classic network model in terms of the cumulant generating function (CGF) of secondary cases. The CGF K(y) of a random variable X can be written as K(y) = κ n y n /n! where κ n are the cumulants of the distribution of secondary infections. These are useful because the cumulants are easier to interpret, i.e., κ 1 is simply the average number of secondary cases R 0 , κ 2 is the underlying variance, κ 3 is related to the skewness and κ 4 to the kurtosis of the full distribution. By definition, a PGF G(x) of a random variable is linked to K(y) through G(x) = exp [K (ln x)]. Therefore, we can replace the PGF G 1 (x) for the distribution of secondary infections by a function in terms of the cumulants of that distribution.

which is obviously not as practical as a simple polynomial when solving for u = G C 1 (u). However, in some cases, cumulants can have significant advantage over the polynomial representation. For instance, the cumulants of a sum of independent random variables are simply the sum of the cumulants -convenient when dealing with diseases with multiple modes of transmission.
We can quickly derive Kermack and McKendrick's result from the previous generating function since their solution involves a well-mixed population, which is equivalent to a Poisson distribution of secondary infections in our framework. G C 1 (x) is convenient for a Poisson distribution because its cumulants κ n = R 0 ∀n. Moreover, since G 0 (x) = G 1 (x) in the Poisson case, we know that the final proportion of susceptible individuals is directly given by u = G C 1 (u), or
Taking the logarithm of the exponential term from this last equation yields Kermack and McKendrick's formula. For more general distributions, it is useful to rewrite Eq. (6) as
The solution to u = G C 1 (u) gives the probability that every infection caused by patient zero fails to generate an epidemic. Importantly, Eq. (8) has an alternating nature because ln x is negative for x < 1 such that its n-th power is positive when n is even and negative when n is odd.
This observation, that the moments of Eq. (8) alternate, can be interpreted as follows. A disease needs a high average number of secondary infections (high κ 1 = R 0 ) to spread, but given that average, a disease with small variance in secondary infections will spread much more reliably and be less likely to stochastically die out (see Fig. 1 ). Given a variance, a disease with high skewness (i.e., with positive deviation contributing to most of the variance) will be more stable than a disease with negative skewness (i.e. with most deviations being towards small secondary infections). Given a skewness, a disease will be more stable if it has frequent small positive deviations rather than infrequent large deviations -hence a smaller kurtosis -as stochastic die out could easily occur before any of those large infrequent deviations occur.
Clearly, our re-interpretation already highlights a striking result: Higher moments of the distribution of secondary cases can lead a disease with a lower R 0 to more easily invade a population and to reach a larger final outbreak size than a disease with a higher R 0 . We can investigate this conclusion further using a simple example of normally distributed secondary infections.
A second useful application of the cumulants formulation involves diseases with a large reproductive number R 0 whose distribution of secondary infections can be convincingly modeled by a normal distribution. The raw moments of a normal distribution are quite complicated, but the cumulants are simple: κ 1 is equal to the mean R 0 , κ 2 is equal to the variance σ 2 , and all other cumulants are 0. We can thus write
and solving for u = G C 1 (u) yields
This equation can then be used for direct comparison of the probability of invasion of two different diseases with normal distributions of secondary infections. Given a transmission event from patient zero to a susceptible individual, disease B will be more likely to invade the population than disease A if
For example, a disease with half the basic reproductive number of another will still be more likely to invade a population and lead to a larger outbreak if its variance is only slightly less than half the variance of the other disease.

Final size of outbreaks with different R 0 and distributions of secondary cases. We use a negative binomial distribution of secondary cases and scan realistic range of parameters. Most importantly, the range of parameters corresponding to the current outbreak of 2019-nCoV is highlighted by a red box. The range of potential R0 comes from a 95% confidence interval using a early data and a classic deterministic models [18, 19] . The range of dispersion parameter k comes from analogy with severe acute respiratory syndrome [13, 24] . Most importantly, with fixed average, the dispersion parameter is inversely proportional to the variance of the underlying distribution of second cases.
From re-emerging pathogens like yellow fever and measles to emerging threats like MERS-CoV and Ebola, the World Health Organization monitored 119 different infectious disease outbreaks in 2019 alone [26] . For each of these outbreaks, predicting both the epidemic potential and the most likely number of cases is critically important for responding efficiently and effectively. This need for rapid situation awareness is why R 0 is so widely used in public health. However, our main analysis, and Eq. (11) in particular, show that not only is R 0 insufficient in fully determining the final size of an outbreak, but having a larger outbreak with a lower R 0 is relatively easy considering the randomness associated with most transmission events and the heterogeneity of physical contacts. To address the need for rapid quantification of risk, while acknowledging the shortcomings of R 0 , we use network science methods to derive both the probability of an epidemic and its final size.
However, these results are not without important caveats. Specifically, we must remember that distributions of secondary cases, just like R 0 itself, are just as much a product of a pathogen as of the population in which it spreads. For example, aspects of the social contact network [27] , metapopulation structure [28, 29] , mobility [30, 31] , adaptive behavior [32, 33] , higher-order contact structure [34, 35] , and even other pathogens [36, 37] , all interact to cause complex patterns of disease emergence, spread, and persistence. Therefore, great care must be taken when using any of these tools to compare outbreaks or to inform current events with past data.
Three types of data could potentially be used in real time to improve predictions by considering secondary case heterogeneity. First, contact tracing data whose objective is to identify people who may have come into contact with an infectious individual. While mostly a preventive measure to identify cases before complications, it directly informs us about potential secondary cases caused by a single individual, and therefore provides us with an estimate for G 1 (x). Both for generating accurate predictions of epidemic risk and controlling the outbreak, it is vital to begin contact tracing before numerous transmission chains become widely distributed across space [38, 39] Second, viral genome sequences provide information on both the timing of the outbreak [40] [41] [42] and structure of secondary cases [43] [44] [45] . For example, methods exist to reconstruct transmission trees for sampled sequences using simple mutational models to construct a likelihood for a specific transmission tree [46, 47] and translate coalescent rates into key epidemiological parameters [48] [49] [50] . Despite the potential for genome sequencing to revolutionize outbreak response, the global public health community still struggles to coordinate data sharing across international borders, between academic researchers, and with private companies [51] [52] [53] .
Third, and most often the first available real time information on novel pathogens, are data related to similar past outbreaks. For example, in Fig. 2 we make a range of predictions for the final size of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan based on R 0 estimates from early cases [18, 19] and for the underlying distribution of secondary cases by analogy with the severe acute respiratory syndrome in similar population [13] . Based on this uncertainty, we obtain a range of final outbreak size (given as a fraction of the total susceptible population) between 5% and 40%. Critically, this large range stems from uncertainty in the heterogeneity of secondary infections. If the heterogeneity is large, sustained transmission is mostly maintained by so-called ""super-spreading"" events, then the outbreak is both more likely to end stochastically, less likely to spread extensively, as well as easier to manage with contact tracing, screening and infection control [24] . With less heterogeneity, the outbreak almost certainly cannot be contained and we must prepare for a pandemic of 2019-nCoV [54, 55] . Clearly, we are in dire need of contact tracing data and/or high-resolution pathogen genome surveillance for this outbreak.
In conclusion, we reiterate that when accounting for the full distribution of secondary cases caused by an infected individual, there is no direct relationship between R 0 and the size of an outbreak. We also stress that both R 0 and the full secondary case distribution are not properties of the disease itself, but instead set by properties of the pathogen, the host population and the context of the outbreak. Nevertheless, we provide a straightforward methodology for translating estimates of transmission heterogeneity into epidemic forecasts. Altogether, predicting outbreak size based on early data is an incredibly complex challenge but one that is increasingly within reach due to new mathematical analyses and faster communication of public health data.

078b9a1b8e59f6b032e37b4a07fc73c59e1f7332,"COVID-19 has caused a major epidemic worldwide, however, much is yet to be known 39 about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. One reason is that the challenges 40 underneath sequencing HCoV-19 directly from clinical samples have not been com-41 pletely tackled. Here we illustrate the application of amplicon and hybrid capture (cap-42 ture)-based sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) 43 sequencing in retrieving complete genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual var-44 iations of HCoV-19 from clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral 45
load. We also examine and compare the bias, sensitivity, accuracy, and other char-46 acteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner. This is, to date, the first 47","HCoV-19, as well as the first comparative study across methods. Our work offers 49 practical solutions for genome sequencing and analyses of HCoV-19 and other 50 emerging viruses. 51
GZMU0030 and GZMU0031) with Ct between 29-32, resulting in inferior sequencing depth 112 (less than 100X) (Table 1) . Isolating viruses and enriching them in cell culture might improve 113 the situation, but this requires high-standard laboratory settings and expertise apart from 114 being time-consuming. Also, unwanted mutations that are not concordant with original clin-115 ical samples may be introduced during the culturing process. 116
To enrich adequate viral content for whole-genome sequencing in a convenient manner, we 117 pursued two other methods: multiplex PCR amplification (amplicon) and hybrid capture 118 (capture) (Fig. 1) . We designed a systematic study to comprehensively validate the bias, 119 sensitivity, inter-individual (variant) and intra-individual (iSNV) accuracy of multiple ap-120 proaches by sequencing serial dilutions of a cultured isolate (unpublished), as well as the 121 eight clinical samples (Fig. 2) . We performed qRT-PCR of 10-fold serial dilutions (D1-D7) of 122 the cultured isolate, and the Ct was 17.3, 20.8, 24.5 for, 28.7, 31.8, 35, and 39.9, respec-123 tively, indicating the undiluted RNA (D0) of the cultured isolate contained ~1E+08 genome 124 copies per mL. For amplicon sequencing, we utilized two kits comprising of two set of pri-125 mers generating PCR products of 300-400 bp and 100-200 bp, respectively. The ~400 bp 126 amplicon-based sequencing was implemented in all samples and analyzed throughout the 127 study, while the ~200 bp amplicon-based sequencing was only applied in the cultured isolate 128 for coverage analysis. 129 to inadequate depth in amplicon sequencing (Fig. 3a) . Another pitfall is that amplification 142 across the genome can hardly be unbiased, causing difficulties in complete genome assem-143 bly. Indeed, amplicon sequencing exhibited a higher level of bias compared with meta-144 transcriptomic sequencing, in terms of coverage across the viral genomes from the cultural 145
isolate and the clinical samples tested in our study (Fig. 3b, d, Supplementary Fig. 1 ). To 146 our surprise, however, capture sequencing was almost as unbiased as meta sequencing, 147 demonstrating better performance than the previous capture method used to enrich ZIKV 148 despite the HCoV-19 genome is ~3 fold larger than ZIKV 22 (Fig. 3b, c) . Two reasons 149 amongst others were likely to be accountable to this improvement, 1) we utilized 506 pieces 150 of 120 ssDNA probes covering 2x of the HCoV-19 genome to capture the libraries, 2) we 151 employed the DNBSEQ sequencing technology that features PCR-free rolling circle replica-152 tion (RCR) of DNA Nanoballs (DNBs) 23,24 . 153
The sequencing results of amplicon and capture approaches revealed dramatic increases 154 in the ratio of HCoV-19 reads out of the total reads compared with meta sequencing, sug-155 gesting the enrichment was highly efficient -5596-fold in capture method and 5710-fold in 156 amplicon method for each sample on average (Supplementary Table 1 -2). To further com-157 pare the sensitivity of different methods, we plotted the number of HCoV-19 reads per million 158 (HCoV-19-RPM) of total sequencing reads against the viral concentration for each sample. 159
The productivity was similar between the two methods when the input RNA of the cultured 160 isolate contained 1E+05 genome copies per mL and above (Fig. 3e) . However, amplicon 161 1E+06 copies of HCoV-19 genome per mL, while capture sequencing requires 24,474 to 9 177 Mb for the same situation (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Table 4) . 178
To determine the accuracy of dif-179 ferent approaches in discovering inter-individual genetic diversity, we tested each method 180 in calling the single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and verified some of the SNVs with Sanger 181 sequencing ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Two to five SNVs were identified within each clinical 182 sample, and in all the seven samples, SNVs identified by the three methods were concord-183 ant except that capture missed one SNV at position 16535 in GZMU0014 (Fig. 4a) . We then 184 investigated the allele frequencies of these sites across methods, and found that alleles 185 identified by capture sequencing displayed lower frequencies than the other two methods, 186 especially for GZMU0014, GZMU0030, and GZMU0042 where the viral load was lower (Ct 187 ≥ 29), which explained why capture sequencing neglected an SNV in our pipeline when the 188 cutoff of SNV calling was set as 80% allele frequency (Fig. 4b) . These data indicate that 189 amplicon sequencing is more accurate than capture sequencing in identifying SNVs, espe-190 cially for challenging samples.

respectively. Together these results suggest amplicon sequencing was not as accurate as 206 capture sequencing in identifying minor alleles, which could be in part due to Matthew effect 207 caused by PCR. 208
sequencing has also allowed us to investigate RNA expression patterns of the overall mi-210 crobiome and host content and thus suitable for discovering new viruses, distinguishing co-211 infections, and dissecting virus-host interactions. To explore the microbiota, we performed 212 further metatranscriptomics analysis of the clinical samples. We were able to identify host 213 nucleic acids in all of the samples, and over 95% of total reads were from the host in sputum, 214 nasal, and throat samples ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Virus contributed to less than 5% of 215 reads in anal swab and throat swab while more than 50% of reads in nasal swab (Supple-216 mentary Fig. 4b ). These results suggest nasal swab could be the most ideal sample type for 217 viral detection among the four sample types, which agrees with recent clinical evidence 25 . 218
Among the viral reads, over 90% were Coronaviridae, which is consistent with clinical diag-219 nostics ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Reads from other viruses were also identified, indicating The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.993584 doi: bioRxiv preprint HCoV-19 under different situations: 1) if one wants to study other genetic materials than the 228 target viruses, or the viruses become highly diversified via recombinational events, or the 229 viral load within the RNA sample is high (e.g. conc. ≥ 1E+05 viral genome copies per mL, or 230
Ct ≤ 24.5), meta sequencing can be prioritized; 2) if one focuses on intra-individual variations 231 for more challenging samples (e.g. conc. < 1E+05 viral genome copies per mL, or Ct > 24.5), 232 capture sequencing seems to be a justified choice; and, 3) if identifying SNVs is the main 233 purpose, the most convenient, economical strategy would be amplicon sequencing that can 234 support high-confidence analyses of samples containing viral content as low as 1E+02 viral 235 genome copies per mL, or Ct as high as 35. 236
Sequencing low-titre viruses directly from clinical samples is challenging, which is further 238 exacerbated by the fact that coronavirus genomes are the largest among RNA viruses (~3 239 fold larger compared with ZIKV). Compared with direct metatranscriptomic sequencing, high 240 sensitivity of hybrid capture and amplicon sequencing methods come at a price of low ac-241 curacy, and neither of the two can be used to sequence highly diverse or recombinant vi-242 ruses because the primers and probes are specific to known viral genomes. Amplicon se-243 quencing compromises its accuracy, while it becomes the most convenient and economical 244 method of all. Either or a combination of the approaches described here can be chosen to 245 cope with various needs of researchers, e.g., metatranscriptomic sequencing data with in-246 sufficient coverage and depth can be pooled with hybrid capture data to generate high qual-247 ity assemblies 22 . Our research, as well as the methods elaborated here, are able to help 248 other researchers to sequence and analyze large viruses from clinical samples and thus 249 benefit investigations on the genomic epidemiology of viruses. 250 Some pros and cons described above might be specific to the experimental workflows and 251 bioinformatics pipelines tailored in this study, e.g., 1) the bias of amplicon sequencing can 252 be improved by reducing the amount of cycles in the 1st PCR or optimize the molar ratios 253 of primers (Fig. 1a) , 2) the amplicon sequencing is particularly convenient compared with 254 previous counterparts since the fragmentation and library construction steps are omitted 255 for 6 min; 2) double-stranded (ds) cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers with frag-291 mented RNA; 3) ds cDNA was subjected to end repair, adaptor ligation, and 18-cycle PCR 292 amplification; 4) PCR products were Unique Dual Indexed (UDI), before going through cir- 100 nt strategy using the same protocol described above, generating 37 Gb sequencing 305 data for each sample on average. 306
Total RNA was reverse transcribed to synthesize the first-strand cDNA with random 308 hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). 
For metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data, total reads were first processed 332 by Kraken v0.10.5 26 (default parameters) with a self-build database of Coronaviridae ge-333 nomes (including SARS, MERS and HCoV-19 genome sequences downloaded from 334 GISAID, NCBI and CNGB) to efficiently identify candidate viral reads with a loose manner. 335
These candidate reads were further qualified with fastp v0.19.5 27 (parameters: -q 20 -u 20 -336 n 1 -l 50) and SOAPnuke v1.5.6 28 (parameters: -l 20 -q 0.2 -E 50 -n 0.02 -5 0 -Q 2 -G -d) to 337 remove low-quality reads, duplications and adaptor contaminations. Low-complexity reads 338 were next filtered by PRINSEQ v0.20.4 29 (parameters: -lc_method dust -lc_threshold 7). 339
After the above process, HCoV-19-like reads generated from metatranscriptomics and 340 hybrid capture method were obtained. 341 Amplicon sequencing data were processed as described above, except that duplications 371
were not removed. A heatmap was generated to visualize the viral genome coverage for all 372 samples sequenced by the amplicon method with the pheatmap 37 package in R (v3.6.1) 36 . 373

HCoV-19 reads of metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data were identified 379 by aligning the HcoV-19-like reads to the HCoV-19 reference genome (GISAID accession: 380 EPI_ISL_402119) with BWA in a strict manner of coverage ≥ 95% and identity ≥ 90%. For 381 comparisons of the coverage and depth of the viral genome across samples and methods, 382
we normalized the viral reads to total sequencing reads with HCoV-19 Reads Per Million 383 (HCoV-19-RPM). HCoV-19-RPM for amplicon sequencing data was calculated by the same 384 pipelines we applied for metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data. 385
To estimate the minimum data requirements for genome assembling and intra-individual 386 variation analysis, we applied gradient-based sampling to the HCoV-19 genome align-387 ments (referred to BAM files) to each dataset using Samtools (v1.9) 34 For amplicon sequencing data, only base positions covered by ≥100X reads were used for 417 iSNVs calling.

For metatranscriptomic sequencing of clinical samples, raw sequencing data of a single se-427 quence lane (approximately 60-75 Gb per sample) was used to simultaneously assess the 428 RNA expression patterns of human, bacteria and viruses in clinical samples from COVID-429 19 patients. We first used software fastp (v0.19.5) 27 to filter low-quality reads and remove 430 adapter with parameters: -5 -3 -q 20 -c -l 30.

07e833d0917cace550853f72923856d0fe1a7120,"Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.","Heparin, the second most widely used drug by weight globally, is formulated as a polydisperse, heterogenous natural product. Unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins and heparinoids are clinically approved as anticoagulants / thrombotic with excellent safety, stability, bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles. Crucially, heparin and its derivatives, some of which lacking significant anticoagulant activity 1 , are an under-exploited antiviral drug class, despite possessing broad-spectrum activity against a multitude of distinct viruses, including coronaviridae and SARSassociated coronavirus strain HSR1 2 , in addition to flaviviruses 3, 4 , herpes 5 , influenza 6 and HIV 7, 8 .
Traditional drug development processes are slow and ineffective against emerging public health threats such as the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak which makes the repurposing of existing drugs a timely and attractive alternative. Heparin, a well-tolerated anticoagulant pharmaceutical, has been used safely in medicine for over 80 years and alongside its anticoagulant activities, its ability to prevent viral infection, including coronaviridae, has been described 1 . Furthermore, the closely related glycosaminoglycan (GAG) member, heparan sulfate (HS), is known to bind CoV surface proteins and to be used by coronavirus for its attachment to target cells 9 .
Currently, there are no commercially available medicinal products designed to treat and/or prevent infections associated with the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak. Here, we describe preliminary tests for the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to bind heparin, an important prerequisite for the underpinning research related to the development of SARS-CoV-2 heparin-based therapeutic.
Residues 330−583 of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (GenBank: MN908947) were cloned upstream of a N-terminal 6XHisTag in the pRSETA expression vector and transformed into SHuffle® T7 Express Competent E. coli (NEB, UK). Protein expression was carried out in MagicMedia™ E. coli Expression Media (Invitrogen, UK) at 30°C for 24 hrs, 250 rpm. The bacterial pellet was suspended in 5 mL lysis buffer (BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent, Merck Millipore, UK; containing DNAse) and incubated at room temperature for 30 mins. Protein was purified from inclusion bodies using IMAC chromatography under denaturing conditions. On-column protein refolding was performed by applying a gradient with decreasing concentrations of the denaturing agent (6-0 M Urea). After extensive washing, protein was eluted using 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4; Lonza, UK) using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare, UK).

The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in PBS was recorded using a J-1500 Jasco CD spectrometer, Spectral Manager II software and a 0.2 mm pathlength quartz cuvette (Hellma, USA) scanning at 100 nm.min -1 with a 1 nm resolution throughout the range of λ = 190 -260 nm. All spectra obtained were the mean of five independent scans post calibration with camphorsulfonic acid. SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was buffer-exchanged (prior to spectral analysis) using a 5 kDa Vivaspin centrifugal filter (Sartorius, Germany) at 12,000 g, thrice. Collected data was analysed with Spectral Manager II software prior to processing with GraphPad Prism 7, using a second order polynomial smoothing through 21 neighbours. Secondary structural prediction was calculated through the BeStSel analysis server 10 .To ensure the CD spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence of heparin was not altered owing to the addition of the heparin alone, which is known to possess CD spectra at high concentrations 11,12 a differential spectrum was analysed. The theoretical, summative CD spectra was confirmed to differ from the observed experimental CD spectra, thereby indicating that the change in the CD spectra compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD alone is a result of a conformational change upon binding to porcine mucosal heparin (Leo Pharma, UK).

Porcine mucosal heparin was biotinylated at the reducing end using hydroxylamine biotin (ThermoFisher, UK) as described by Thakar et al. 14 . Heparin (20 µL 50 mg/mL) was reacted with 20 µL hydroxylamine-biotin in 40 µL 300 mM aniline (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and 40 µL 200 mM acetate pH 6 for 48 h at 37 °C. Free biotin was removed by gelfiltration chromatography on Sephadex G25 (GE LifeSciences, UK).
A P4SPR, multi-channel Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) instrument (Affinté Instruments; Montréal, Canada) was utilised with a gold sensor chip that was plasma cleaned prior to derivatization. A self-assembled monolayer of mPEG thiol and biotin mPEG was formed by incubating the chip in a 1 mM solution of these reagents at a 99:1 molar ratio in ethanol for 24 hrs 15 . The chip was rinsed with ethanol and placed into the instrument. PBS (1X) was used as the running buffer for the three sensing and a fourth background channel at 500 µl.min -1 , using an Ismatec pump. Twenty micrograms of streptavidin (Sigma, UK; 1mL in PBS) were injected over the four sensor channels. Subsequently, biotin-heparin (1 mL) was injected over the three sensing channels.
In binding experiments, the ligate was injected over the three sensing channels, diluted to the concentration indicated in the figure legends at 500 µl.min -1 . Sensor surfaces with bound FGF2 were regenerated by a wash with 2 M NaCl, whereas 20 mM HCl was used to regenerate surfaces with bound SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD as 2 M NaCl was ineffective to disrupt binding. Background binding to the underlying streptavidin bound to the mPEG/biotin mPEG self-assembled monolayer was determined by injection over the control channel.

FGF2, a well characterised heparin-binding protein was used to test the successful functionalization of the three sensing channels with biotin-heparin. Injection of 1 mL 100 nM FGF2 over the sensing channels elicited a significant response (Fig. 1A , injection between the red arrows). However, 100 nM FGF2 elicited no response in the control channel, functionalized solely with streptavidin (not shown). The bound FGF2 was removed by a wash with 2 M NaCl, as done previously for the IASys optical biosensor 16 .
When 65 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was injected over the three sensing channels, there was an initial decrease in signal, followed by an increase, indicative of binding ( Fig. 1B between red arrows) . The initial decrease was due to a slightly lower refractive index of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD protein solution compared to the PBS of the running buffer, which caused a negative bulk shift. This is demonstrated by the injection of 65 nM solution over the control channel, functionalized with just streptavidin, where there was a decrease in response, followed by a return to baseline when the channel was returned to running buffer (Fig. 1C, between red arrows) . These data demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD protein binds specifically to heparin immobilised through its reducing-end and fails to bind to the underlying streptavidin / ethyleneglycol surface.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy detects changes in protein secondary structure that occur in solution using UV radiation. Upon binding, conformational changes are detected and quantified using spectral deconvolution 17 . Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD underwent conformational change in the presence of heparin ( Figure 2) . Combined, Helix content increased by 4.8% and global beta-sheet content decreased by 4.4%. The observed changes further demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD interacts with heparin in aqueous solution of physiological significance, whereby the major changes induced by heparin are those associated with antiparallel and helix content.
Basic amino acids are known to dictate the binding between proteins and heparin. With that in mind, primary sequence analysis of the expressed protein domain and analysis of the modelled SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD structure (Figure 3) shows that there are several potential heparin binding sites and, more importantly, that theses patches of basic amino acids are exposed on the protein surface. the author/funder.

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 represents a significant challenge to global health authorities and, as there are no currently approved drugs to treat, prevent and/or mitigate its effects, repurposing existing drugs is both a timely and appealing strategy. Heparin, a well tolerated anticoagulant drug, has been used successfully for over 80 years with limited and manageable side effects. Furthermore, heparin belongs to a unique class of pharmaceuticals that has effective antidotes available, which makes its use safer.
Studying SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein structure and behaviour in solution is a vital step for the development of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Here, the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to bind pharmaceutical heparin has been studied using spectroscopic techniques in concert with molecular modelling. The data show that SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to heparin and that upon binding, a significant structural change is induced. Moreover, moieties of basic amino acid residues, known to constitute heparin binding domains, are solvent accessible on the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD surface and form a continuous patch that is suitable for heparin binding.
Glycosaminoglycans are ubiquitously present on almost all mammalian cells and this class of carbohydrates are central to the strategy employed by coronaviridae to attach to host cells. Heparin has previously been shown to inhibit SARS-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 cell invasion 2, 18 and this, in concert with the data presented within this study, supports the utilisation of glycosaminoglycan-derived pharmaceuticals against SARS-associated coronavirus. Furthermore, this study strongly supports the repurposing of heparin and its derivatives as antiviral agents, providing a rapid countermeasure against the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
It is noteworthy that even pharmaceutical-grade heparin preparations remain a polydisperse mixture of natural products, containing both anticoagulant and nonanticoagulant saccharide structures. The latter may prove to be an invaluable resource for next-generation, biologically active, antiviral agents that display negligible anticoagulant potential, whilst the former remains tractable to facile, chemical (and enzymatic) engineering strategies to ablate their anticoagulation activities.
The subfractionation of existing heparin preparations against anticoagulant activities (with proven low-toxicity profiles, good bioavailability and industrial-scale manufacturing) for off-label pathologies, provides an attractive strategy for quickly and effectively responding to COVID-19 and for the development of next generation heparin-based therapeutics.
Such drugs will be amenable to routine parenteral administration through currently established routes and additionally, direct to the respiratory tract via nasal administration, using nebulised heparin, which would be unlikely to gain significant access to the circulation. Thus, the anticoagulant activity of heparin, which can in any event be engineered out, would not pose a problem. Importantly, such a route of administration would not only be suitable for prophylaxis, but also for patients under mechanical ventilation 19 . the author/funder. All rights reserved.

08660499ee722a74043f8417faee3e1eeb9d0f5f,"The ongoing Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged public health surveillance, response, and control systems. Even as the epidemic appears to be near its end in the Americas, it is unclear whether substantial Zika virus transmission may still be ongoing. This issue is exacerbated by large discrepancies in local case reporting and significant delays in detecting outbreaks due to surveillance gaps. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks in the Americas, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe to identify signatures of transmission dynamics that were not captured by local reporting. We found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we show that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by longlived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior. Our data suggest that while aggressive mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, in the absence of vaccines, herd immunity, or strong international coordination, such control measures may need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be 'silently' spreading in the Americas and provides a framework for more accurately understanding outbreak dynamics.","The recent Zika epidemic in the Americas is a testament to how rapidly mosquito-borne viruses can emerge and spread, and has revealed flaws in our surveillance and response systems (Grubaugh et al., 2018a; Morens and Fauci, 2017) . Due, in part, to high rates of subclinical infections and overlapping symptoms with infections from dengue and chikungunya viruses (Mitchell et al., 2018) , Zika virus was circulating for more than a year and a half before it was first detected in Brazil (Faria et al., 2017) . By the time Zika virus was discovered in May of 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015) and recognized for its ability to cause severe congenital disease (França et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016) , the virus had already spread from Brazil to more than 40 countries (Faria et al., 2017; Grubaugh et al., 2017; Metsky et al., 2017; Thézé et al., 2018) . By mid 2017, reports from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO, 2017a) revealed Zika virus activity throughout the Americas was waning, prompting predictions for the end of the epidemic (e.g. (O'Reilly et al., 2018) ) and the removal of the World Health Organization's (WHO) ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" status (WHO, 2016a (WHO, , 2016b .
Coordinated response efforts during the early stages of the Zika epidemic were ultimately contingent on countries detecting cases and reporting them to international health agencies (Lessler et al., 2016) , including PAHO. For Zika virus and other Aedes aegypti mosquito-borne virusesincluding dengue and chikungunya viruses -that disproportionately impact those with limited resources (Braga et al., 2010; Gardner et al., 2018; Netto et al., 2017) , accurate local reporting is especially problematic. Not only are people in poor living conditions more likely to be exposed to infected mosquitoes, but such communities often have less access to adequate healthcare, resulting in more cases going undetected (Hotez, 2016; LaBeaud, 2008) . Pockets of virus transmission that occur in countries with inadequate reporting can therefore facilitate 'hidden' outbreaks, increasing the risk of infected travelers causing outbreaks in new regions of the world. Thus, underreported or unrecognized local outbreaks may prolong epidemics, and hinder global efforts aimed at halting virus spread.
Infectious disease surveillance of international travelers has long been an effective method to detect pathogens circulating in resource-limited areas (Hamer et al., 2017; Harvey et al., 2013; Leder et al., 2013 Leder et al., , 2017 Wilder-Smith et al., 2012) . We hypothesized that similar frameworks could be leveraged to improve Zika virus surveillance, as many regions in the Americas affected by the epidemic attract large volumes of international visitors from countries with stronger healthcare and surveillance systems (Wilder-Smith et al., 2018) . In this study, we used international travel data, coupled with virus genomics, to detect ongoing Zika virus transmission that was missed by local reporting. We discovered a large Zika outbreak in Cuba that was not reported to PAHO (PAHO, 2017a) or other public health agencies, and thus went undetected to the international community. We show that the outbreak in Cuba peaked in 2017, when the epidemic in the rest of the Americas was waning (PAHO, 2017a) , and estimate that it was as large as those in neighboring countries that occured the year before. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we also show that the outbreak in Cuba was caused by multiple introductions from elsewhere in the Caribbean and Central America. Overall, our study outlines a framework for how traveler surveillance data, combined with virus genomics, can detect 'hidden' outbreaks and reconstruct transmission dynamics when local data are insufficient.
Tracking the spread of epidemics requires accurate case reporting and strong international collaboration. Failure to do so leaves us vulnerable to surveillance 'blind spots', with the potential for prolonging epidemics and increasing their geographic spread. Zika virus was first detected in Brazil in May, 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015) , yet studies have shown that the epidemic started at least one and a half years prior to its discovery (Faria et al., 2017) . Early in 2016, 48 countries across the Americas reported local outbreaks (PAHO, 2017b), with case numbers peaking later that year. By mid 2017, new Zika cases were no longer being reported to the international community (PAHO, 2017b). Due to widespread surveillance gaps and inconsistent reporting, however, we hypothesized that local Zika outbreaks could still be occurring in the Americas, despite not being captured by the international community. To investigate whether Zika virus transmission is still ongoing, we used international travel data to reveal that local outbreaks were still occurring in 2017, despite relatively few cases being reported (Fig. 1) . Our data demonstrate that the vast majority of Zika cases during 2017 were the result of an unreported Zika outbreak in Cuba, which occurred while public data suggested the epidemic was nearing its end in the Americas (PAHO, 2017a) (Fig. 1) .
To determine whether Zika case reports from international travelers could reveal outbreaks not captured by local case reports, we compared the temporal distribution of local and travel-associated Zika cases from 2016 to 2018 (Fig. 1) . We obtained monthly suspected and confirmed Zika cases reported by individual countries and territories from PAHO. We obtained reports of international travelassociated Zika cases from the Florida Department of Health (FL-DOH) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). We constructed Zika epidemic (epi) curves based on either local or travelassociated cases and found that they were in strong agreement from South America (Pearson r = 0.917 and 0.976 using FL-DOH and ECDC data, respectively) and the Caribbean (Pearson r = 0.828 and 0.856), and to a smaller extent Central America and Mexico (Pearson r = 0.542 and 0.583). For South America and Central America, we also found concordance for when the last local and travel cases were reported in August and September, 2017 (Fig. 1A) .
We found that the last local case from the Caribbean was also reported in August, 2017. However, we observed a spike in Zika cases from travelers returning from the Caribbean during the summer of 2017 that were not captured by local reports, and Zika virus infected travelers from the Caribbean were reported until the end of the reporting period from the ECDC (December, 2017) and FL-DOH (October, 2018; Fig.  1A ). By examining potential source locations for the travelassociated Zika cases in 2017, we found that between June, 2017 and October, 2018 more than 98% of them came from Cuba (90 of 91 Zika diagnoses in Florida, 63 of 64 Zika diagnoses in Europe; Fig. 1B ). To further confirm the timing of a Zika outbreak in Cuba, we obtained travel-related infection data from the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network (Hamer et al., 2017; Leder et al., 2017) and found that 76% of the Zika cases associated with travel from Cuba were diagnosed in 2017 (22 of 29; Fig. 1C ). While our travel data show that a Zika outbreak peaked in Cuba in 2017 with waning transmission continuing into 2018, during this time period no local Zika cases were reported by Cuba to PAHO or other international public health agencies (PAHO, 2017a).
The Zika outbreak in Cuba was as large as those on other Caribbean islands created a model using relationships between travel and local Zika case reporting, and found that it was likely as large as those on other Caribbean islands that peaked a year prior (Fig. 2) .
In the absence of local case reporting, studies have demonstrated that travel-associated cases can be used to infer aspects of local virus transmission dynamics (Cauchemez et al., 2014; Fraser et al., 2009; Meltzer et al., 2008) . Only 187 laboratory-confirmed Zika cases were reported by Cuba in 2016, and none were reported in 2017 (PAHO, 2017c) .
These reports are inconsistent with the outbreak dynamics that we detected using travel surveillance (Figs. 1B, 2A) . To estimate the number of likely cases that should have been reported in Cuba in 2016 and 2017, we first investigated if travel cases accurately reflected the dynamics of known local Zika outbreaks for individual countries and territories outside Cuba (Fig 2A) . We found that in places with at least 20 travelassociated Zika cases reported (Fig.  S1) , epi curves constructed from travel incidences were generally in agreement with epi curves generated from local reporting (mean Pearson r = 0.769, range = 0.121-0.984; Supplemental File 1).
We next constructed a Bayesian model to approximate the size of the Zika outbreak in Cuba using the mean posterior estimates of the proportion of local to travel incidence from 23 countries throughout the Americas (Fig. S2) , each individually multiplied by the mean posterior estimates of the Cuba travel incidence rate (Fig. S3) . Taking the population size of Cuba into account, we estimated that 5,707 Zika cases (interquartile range: 1,071 to 22,611) likely went unreported in this country (Fig. 2B) , with the majority of these cases (>99%) having occurred in 2017. Our results therefore suggest that the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba was similar in size to the known 2016 outbreaks in countries with similar population sizes, such as Haiti (3,103 reported cases), Dominican Republic (5,305 reported cases), and Jamaica (7,165 reported cases; Fig. 2C ).
We next determined the timing and origin of the Zika outbreak in Cuba using virus sequencing from travelers infected in Cuba. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that it was caused by multiple introductions of Zika virus from outbreaks in the Americas during the summer of 2016, corresponding to the season of peak Ae. aegypti transmission potential in Cuba (Fig. 3) .
We sequenced Zika virus genomes from nine infected Florida travelers arriving from Cuba during 2017-2018 and obtained one Cuban Zika virus genome from GenBank (MF438286). In addition to our previous Zika virus sequences from the 2016 outbreak , we also sequenced four additional genomes from Florida to demonstrate that the Zika virus lineages from Cuba were distinct from those in Florida, and thus bonafide travelassociated cases (Fig. 3A) . We openly shared all sequences as they were generated (https://andersenlab.com/secrets/data/zikagenomics/), and combined them with other publicly available sequences for a final dataset of 283
Zika virus genomes (Supplemental File 2 and Fig. 3) .
We constructed phylogenetic trees using time-resolved Bayesian inference (Fig. 3A) and maximum likelihood reconstruction (Fig. S4) . We found that the Zika virus lineages in Cuba clustered with other virus genomes from the Americas, showing that the outbreak in Cuba was a continuation of the epidemic in the Americas, as opposed to introductions from ongoing Zika outbreaks in Asia Watts et al., 2018) (Fig. 3A) . Based on the placement of the Zika virus genomes from Cuba, we found evidence for one introduction from Central America (Fig. 3B , clade '1-Cuba') and at least two from the Caribbean (Fig. 3A, 3B , clades '2-Cuba', '3-Cuba', and '4-Cuba'); however the placement of clade '4-Cuba' is ambiguous, as it clusters with clade '3-Cuba' in the maximum likelihood tree (Fig. S4) , and may not be a seperate introduction (Fig. S4) .
We estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for each of the Cuban Zika virus clades to be between July and September, 2016 (Fig. 3B) . These findings suggest that the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba was caused by multiple introductions during the summer of 2016, corresponding to the peak of the Zika outbreaks in the Caribbean and Central America (June-September, 2016; Fig. 1A ).
Zika virus is vectored by Ae. aegypti, so we next investigated if the introductions of the virus into Cuba aligned with the optimal time period for mosquito-borne transmission. Temperature is the primary seasonal factor driving Zika virus transmission as it influences mosquito development, survival, reproduction, biting rates, and vector competence (Caminade et al., 2016; Mordecai et al., 2017; Siraj et al., 2017) . Thus, we used a model that estimated when transmission was most likely to occur based on favorable temperature ranges for mosquitoborne transmission (Mordecai et al., 2017) . Using weather data for Cuba, we found that the Zika virus introductions into Cuba corresponded to the period of optimal local Ae. aegypti transmission potential (Fig 3C) . The timing of multiple Zika virus introductions during the summer of 2016 is therefore unsurprising, as they appear to have occurred when Zika virus activity was peaking in source locations and local Ae. aegypti transmission potential in Cuba was high. These findings, however, do not explain why transmission in Cuba did not peak until 2017, which was at least a year later than other local outbreaks in the Americas (PAHO, 2017b) ( Fig. 2A) .
Given that Zika outbreaks were occurring throughout the Caribbean in 2016, and that the virus was introduced into Cuba in mid-2016, we investigated what factors may have been responsible for delaying the peak of the Cuban outbreak by a year (Fig. 1) . We explored three primary hypotheses:
(1) fewer opportunities for Zika virus introductions into Cuba in 2015 when introductions were occurring elsewhere in the Caribbean (Faria et al., 2017; Metsky et al., 2017) , (2) differences in environmental conditions in 2016 lowering the susceptibility for Ae. aegypti-borne virus outbreaks, and (3) Ae. aegypti surveillance and control campaigns (Gorry, 2016; Reardon, 2016) limiting virus transmission. To investigate the likelihood of each hypothesis, we examined international travel patterns, yearly transmission of dengue virus (also vectored by Ae. aegypti), local weather conditions, and news reports. Comparing all three hypotheses, we found that conditions in Cuba could likely have supported a large Zika outbreak in 2016, but that it may have been delayed by a countrywide Ae. aegypti control campaign (Fig. 4) .
Outbreaks of Ae. aegypti-borne viruses, including Zika virus, require conducive conditions to support sustained transmission and opportunities for virus introductions. As air travel is the main source of long-distance virus dispersion Nunes et al., 2014; Semenza et al., 2014) , we analyzed air travel patterns to determine if Cuba had fewer opportunities for virus introductions early during the epidemic, potentially delaying the outbreak (Fig.  4A ). Using monthly airline passenger arrivals coming from all 48 countries and territories in the Americas known to have local Zika virus transmission from 2014-2017, we did not detect any large deviations in air traffic to Cuba when Zika virus was being introduced elsewhere in the Caribbean (starting in mid-2015; Fig. 4A ) (Faria et al., 2017; Metsky et al., 2017) . Moreover, air travel volumes were higher into Cuba than neighboring islands with large outbreaks in 2016, including Puerto Rico and Jamaica (Fig. 4A) . These findings suggest that changes in air travel did not play a role in delaying the outbreak in Cuba.
It is possible that environmental conditions in Cuba in 2016 were not conducive for large Ae. aegypti-borne virus outbreaks. To explore this scenario, we examined transmission of another Ae. aegypti-borne virus, dengue virus, using incidence rates from travel-associated dengue cases reported by the FL-DOH (Fig. 4B) . We found that following large dengue outbreaks in Cuba in 2014 and 2015, dengue virus transmission subsided in 2016 before increasing in 2017 (Fig. 4B) . The dengue epi curves were similar to the Zika epi curves from 2016 to 2017 (Fig. 4B) , supporting the hypothesis that conditions in Cuba were not conducive for large Ae. aegypti-borne virus outbreaks in 2016. These data, however, do not reveal if this was due to local weather conditions or human intervention.
As temperature is the primary driver of Ae. aegypti-borne virus transmission (Caminade et al., 2016; Mordecai et al., 2017; Siraj et al., 2017) , we used our temperaturedependent transmission model (Fig. 3C) to determine if local weather in 2016 may have delayed the Zika outbreak in Cuba to 2017 (Fig. 4B) . We found that this was likely not the case, as Ae. aegypti transmission potential was as high in 2016 as it was during the dengue outbreaks in 2014 and 2015, and the Zika outbreak in 2017 (Fig. 4B) . These findings suggest that environmental factors were likely not responsible for delaying the Zika outbreak in Cuba.
We previously demonstrated that mosquito control campaigns can reduce Ae. aegypti populations and human Zika virus infections . Cuba has a long history of successful Ae. aegypti control (Gubler, 1989; Toledo et al., 2007) , and following the detection of the Zika outbreak in Brazil, the country implemented a ""National Zika Action Plan"" for aggressive Ae. aegypti mosquito surveillance and control (Gorry, 2016; Reardon, 2016) . To investigate if mosquito control may have played a role in delaying the Zika outbreak in Cuba, we compared the reported start of the mosquito control campaign to Zika and dengue virus transmission (based on travel incidence rates) in Cuba (Fig. 4B) . We found that following the implementation of mosquito control in February, 2016, travel incidence data showed minimal transmission of both dengue and Zika viruses throughout the year (Fig. 4B) . By searching news articles for Zika and dengue in Cuba from 2015-2018, we found that Cuban officials reported that the mosquito control program was successful, based on a near elimination of dengue and very few Zika cases (see Supplemental File 3 for a timeline of selected news articles). However, no information was reported on the overall length of the campaign, and importantly, if it was still ongoing when the Zika outbreak intensified in 2017. The timing of the mosquito control campaign, followed by a decrease in both dengue and Zika cases (Fig. 4B ) -despite high transmission potential (Fig. 4B ) -suggests that mosquito control efforts may have been responsible for delaying the Zika outbreak in Cuba. The outbreak the following year was likely preceded by a resurgence in Ae. aegypti populations, leading to an increase in transmission of Zika virus lineages that were introduced in 2016 (Fig. 3) .
Unrecognized and delayed outbreaks have the risk of 'silently' spreading viruses to other parts of the world. To investigate potential risks of undetected Zika outbreaks, we analyzed global air travel patterns and Ae. aegypti suitability, and identified several regions where Zika virus could have been introduced from an unrecognized outbreak in Cuba during 2017.
Based on the occurrence of travel-associated Zika cases reported by the FL-DOH and the ECDC, we found that Zika virus transmission in Cuba was the most intense between June-December of 2017 (Fig. 5A) . We then used this time period to assess where local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission could have been introduced from Cuba using global air travel data from Cuba and previously estimated world-wide Ae. aegypti suitability (Kraemer et al., 2015) (Fig. 5B) . Out of a total of ~4 million air travelers departing Cuba between June and December of 2017, we found 18 countries and US states that received >20,000 travelers, with >100,000 arriving in Florida, Canada, Mexico, and Spain (Fig. 5B) . Based on environmental suitability for Ae. aegypti of the 18 areas with >20,000 travelers from Cuba, we estimated that Florida, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, and Colombia were most at risk of Zika virus having been introduced from Cuba during June-December, 2017 (Fig. 5B) . Indeed, four local Zika cases were reported in Florida during 2017 linked to their partners having recently returned from Cuba (FL DOH, 2017a . Despite these findings, however, beyond a few cases, no Zika outbreaks were reported in these 18 regions in 2017, perhaps due to existing herd immunity (Netto et al., 2017; Zambrana et al., 2018) . These The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/496901 doi: bioRxiv preprint results show the global connectedness of Cuba, and with Zika cases associated with travel to Cuba still ongoing as of October, 2018 (Fig. 1) , continued surveillance is required to detect potential further spread.
Using travel data and virus genomics, we discovered a Zika outbreak in Cuba during 2017, a period in which the epidemic was waning across the Americas (PAHO, 2017a) ( Figs. 1 & 2) . Reports of an outbreak in Cuba did make the news in 2017 (Reuters, 2017) , but critically, the outbreak was not reported by PAHO (PAHO, 2017a), or other public health agencies, and thus went largely undetected by the international community. With Zika outbreaks still arising in new locations, including Angola (Virological, 2018) and India (Pulla, 2018) , both with possible origins in the Americas, it is important to identify and report lingering outbreaks to better prepare for potential future spread (Bogoch et al., 2016; Kraemer et al., 2017) (Fig. 5) .
Epidemiological updates by the WHO and PAHO are the primary methods for disseminating information about infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. Critically, they rely on accurate case reporting from individual countries and territories, but depending on resources and priorities, the reporting of local outbreaks may not be accurate. In this study, we investigated how Zika surveillance of international travelers can be used in conjunction with existing systems to fill knowledge gaps about ongoing outbreaks from places with irregular reporting that are difficult to sample. Our approach is particularly appropriate for regions such as the Caribbean, which, despite its long history of mosquito-borne virus outbreaks (Brathwaite Dick et al., 2012; Patterson et al., 2016; Weaver et al., 2018) , is often understudied.
Using travelers for surveillance, however, is limited to where people primarily travel, which will be largely different for each destination. By using travel data from Europe, we were able to capture Zika cases from countries that we could not from Florida ( Fig. 2A) , but we did not detect any infected travelers coming from the Zika outbreaks in Angola (Virological, 2018) and India (Pulla, 2018) from any of our sources. Thus, using travelers as sentinels alone cannot provide a complete global picture of ongoing Zika outbreaks.
We estimate that the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba was similar in size to outbreaks from other Caribbean islands that peaked the year prior (Fig. 2) . These analyses utilize .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/496901 doi: bioRxiv preprint the relationships between local-and travel-associated Zika data from non-Cuba countries, in combination with travel volumes and travel associated cases from Cuba. Other studies have used similar approaches to estimate the number of people infected with influenza A/H1N1 virus (Fraser et al., 2009) and the number of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome cases (Cauchemez et al., 2014) . However, there are important limitations to such approaches that may influence our ability to estimate the size of the Zika outbreak in Cuba. First, accurate travel data are necessary to calculate travel incidence rates of Zika cases. This is challenging for Cuba, as travel policies from the United States have repeatedly changed during the past few years (Robles, 2016) . To minimize this issue, we included air travel from both scheduled commercial flights from the International Air Transportation Association (IATA, 2018) and chartered flights from the U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT, 2018). Additionally, we also obtained travel-associated Zika virus case data from Europe, where the travel policies to Cuba to the best of our knowledge have not recently changed.
Our estimated outbreak size also does not take into account differences in public health systems providing local data, and differing likelihoods of travelers becoming infected. For example, because of differences in public health infrastructure and resources, Zika case reporting in Haiti may be less accurate than Puerto Rico (Braga et al., 2017; Dowell et al., 2011) . Additionally, exposures to mosquitoes are likely different between local residents and travelers, leading to differences in infection risks between the two populations. Such potential risk differences are largely unknown and dependent on location, behaviors, and length of stay (Cauchemez et al., 2014; Fraser et al., 2009) , which could influence our estimates.
Finally, our size estimates are based on averaging across all regions, some of which may be more, or less, representative of the Zika outbreak in Cuba. While we found a strong correlation between epi curves generated from travel associated Zika cases and local reporting, variability among locations resulted in a wide interquartile range (1,071 to 22,611) on our mean estimate of 5,707 unreported Zika cases in Cuba. Our mean estimate, however, is consistent with the only two public reports from the outbreak in Cuba of 187 cases in 2016 reported by PAHO (PAHO, 2017c) and 1,847 cases in 2017 reported by the news agency Reuters (Reuters, 2017) . Zika outbreaks from other locations in the Americas with comparable population sizes to Cuba were also reported to be similar in size (Fig. 2C) .
By sequencing Zika virus genomes from travelers infected in Cuba, we demonstrate that the 2017 outbreak was sparked by at least three introductions of the virus a year earlier (Fig. 3) . Given our estimated size of the outbreak in Cuba, however, there are likely many additional Zika virus introductions not captured in our analyses . Our tMRCA estimates of the Zika virus lineages from Cuba suggest that the virus survived the low mosquito abundance season (i.e. 'overwintered' from November to March) to cause more intense transmission in 2017 after the local mosquito population rebounded. While the factors supporting virus 'overwintering' are still unclear, it is plausible that Zika virus may have survived low mosquito abundance through a combination of low level mosquito-to-human transmission, vertical transmission in mosquitoes (da Costa et al., 2018; Thangamani et al., 2016) , and, to a lesser extend, human sexual transmission (Althaus and Low, 2016). Considering that a large Zika outbreak in Cuba did not occur until after the viruses successfully 'overwintered', which may happen often with Zika outbreaks (Faria et al., 2017; Thézé et al., 2018) , better understanding of how Zika virus is maintained when mosquito abundance is low might lead to novel control methods.
By investigating news reports and modeling mosquito abundance, our study suggests that the Zika outbreak in Cuba may have been delayed by an Ae. aegypti control campaign (Fig. 4) (Gorry, 2016; Reardon, 2016) . This accomplishment highlights the value of mosquito control for limiting transmission , as Cuba may have been able to reduce the local burden of both dengue and Zika, despite otherwise conducive ecological conditions to support transmission of the viruses (Fig. 4B) . However, we were unable to confirm if the mosquito control campaign was indeed successful, or what was specifically done, and for how long. Rather, we had to rely on temperature-dependent modeling of Ae. aegypti-borne transmission and local news reporting to test our hypothesis that the delayed outbreak was environmentalor mosquito control-dependent. Having access to empirical mosquito abundance data would have allowed us to assess year-to-year differences in transmission potential and to specifically test if Ae. aegypti populations were reduced during the control campaign .
All available data suggest that the Zika epidemic is waning in the Americas (Fig. 1) . This includes the Zika outbreak in Cuba where, based on our travel data, the outbreak was significantly smaller in 2018 as compared to 2017 (Fig.  1B) . Cryptic Zika virus transmission is likely still occurring in regions of the Americas, however, incomplete surveillance and reporting make this difficult to confirm and quantify. Accurate Zika virus seroprevalence surveys (Balmaseda et al., 2017; Zambrana et al., 2018) are now needed to determine the extent of 'hidden' outbreaks of Zika, and to get more accurate measures of the true overall size of the epidemic. Open access to empirical mosquito abundance data is also critical for more precise forecasting of transmission potential and to evaluate control measures (Rund and Martinez, 2017) ; importantly, these efforts should be prioritized and more fully supported. Such initiatives, combined with our framework of using travelers as sentinels of Zika virus infections, can serve as complementary resources to detect, monitor, and reconstruct outbreaks when local surveillance is insufficient.
This work was evaluated and approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at The Scripps Research Institute. This work was conducted as part of the public health response in Florida and samples were collected under a waiver of consent granted by the FL-DOH Human Research Protection Program. The work received a nonhuman subjects research designation (category 4 exemption) by the FL-DOH because this research was performed with remnant clinical diagnostic specimens involving no more than minimal risk. All samples were deidentified before receipt by the study investigators.
PAHO is the primary source for information regarding Zika virus spread in the Americas, as well as suspected and confirmed cases per country and territory (PAHO, 2017a). Weekly case counts, however, are made available as cumulative cases, not the number of new cases per week. These data are often problematic for reconstructing outbreak dynamics because of reporting delays and 'spikes' (e.g. more than one week of cases submitted after weeks of no reporting). Curated weekly case counts per country and territory are presented as bar graphs (not as datasheets) (PAHO, 2017a) . Therefore, to increase the accuracy of calculating Zika virus incidence rates, we captured screenshots of the 2016-2017 weekly Zika virus case (suspected and confirmed) distributions, and extracted the case counts using Web Plot Digitizer v3.10 (http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer), which we previously validated . Extracted case numbers were recorded in .csv files and aggregated per month for this analysis. Yearly human population numbers were retrieved from the United Nations Population Division (https://population.un.org/wpp/) and were used to calculate monthly local Zika virus incidence rates (suspected and confirmed Zika cases/100,000 population) per country and territory. Monthly Zika cases and incidence rates are available at: https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_cuba-travelzika.
Weekly cumulative travel-associated Zika and dengue case numbers were collected from 2014-2018, and are publically available from the FL DOH (FL DOH, 2018). The cases reported on the FL DOH database include those that were confirmed by both PCR and serological assays, and within and without symptoms onset dates (note that many of the pregnant women that were serologically positive for Zika virus were asymptomatic). A travel history was also recorded for most patients. For this study, we only included PCR positive cases with a known date for the onset of symptoms and who only traveled to one international location within the 2 weeks prior to symptoms onset so we could more accurately sort the temporal and spatial distribution of travel-associated cases. We also excluded cases with sexual or congenital exposure. We aggregated the data by month of symptoms onset and by location of likely exposure (i.e. travel origin). Of the travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in Florida (n = 1,333), 49% were visiting friends and relatives, 17% were refugees or immigrants, 17% were traveling for tourism, 3% were traveling for business, and 14% were traveling for unknown or other reasons. Of the travelassociated dengue virus cases where the questionnaire was given (only started for dengue in 2016, n = 88), 67% were visiting friends and relatives, 25% were traveling for tourism, and 8% were traveling for other reasons.
We also requested travel-associated Zika cases from the ECDC European Surveillance System (TESSy) (ECDC, 2017) . We requested all travel-associated Zika cases reported to the ECDC during 2016-2017, sorted by month of symptoms onset, reporting country, and location of likely exposure. The data was provided by Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and released by ECDC. The raw travel-associated case counts from Europe has not been published, was obtained through specific request from the ECDC, and we do not have permission to make it public. In addition, the views and opinions that we expressed herein do not necessarily state or reflect those of ECDC. The accuracy of our statistical analysis and the findings we report are not the responsibility of ECDC. ECDC is not responsible for conclusions or opinions drawn from the data provided. ECDC is not responsible for the correctness of the data and for data management, data merging, and data collation after provision of the data. ECDC shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data.
Data on travelers to Cuba diagnosed at GeoSentinel sites were also analyzed. The GeoSentinel Global Surveillance Network consists of 72 specialized travel and tropical medicine clinics in 32 countries, and is staffed by specialists in travel and tropical medicine (http://www.istm.org/geosentinel). The GeoSentinel clinics provide routine clinical care to ill travelers and contribute de-identified demographic, travel, and clinical surveillance data on patients with travel-related illnesses to a centralized database (Harvey et al., 2013; Leder et al., 2013) . Patient records with Cuba listed as the country of exposure and a diagnosis of mosquito-acquired Zika virus infection were extracted from the GeoSentinel database for the time period January 1, 2016 to November 12, 2018. Only confirmed cases were included in this analysis; these were defined as Zika virus PCR-positive in serum or urine, or Zika virus-specific IgM in serum and Zika virus antibody titers greater than four-fold higher than antibody titers for dengue or other flaviviruses or a four-fold rise in anti-Zika virus IgG and Zika virus antibody titers greater than fourfold higher than antibody titers for dengue or other flaviviruses (Hamer et al., 2017) .
Monthly Zika virus travel incidence rates from all exposure (origin) and reporting (destination) combinations were calculated by number of travel-associated cases per 100,000 airline passengers (from origin to destination/month). Exposure-reporting combinations that accounted for less than 20 imported cases were not included in analysis. Air travel data was obtained as described below.
Though we previously hypothesized cruise ships may have an underrecognized role in Zika virus spread , we did not use data from Zika virus infections that may have been associated with cruise travel, and thus did not collect cruise ship data for this study. First, there were very few infections linked to cruise travel in our dataset, which may be because these cases would more likely be tourists diagnosed elsewhere (and just visiting Florida for the cruise departure). Second, many of the reported cruise-related Zika infections were associated with more than one site for potential exposure, making it difficult to estimate local incidence rates (we removed all travel cases with multiple locations of potential exposure from our analyses). Third, scheduled cruise ship passengers arriving in Florida that stopped in Cuba are predicted to be substantially fewer (11,675/month scheduled for 2019; crawled from CruiseMapper: https://www.cruisemapper.com/) than air travel passengers from Cuba to Florida (80,366/month in 2017) . Cruise travel between Cuba and Florida only began in 2016 (Vora, 2016) , and thus there would have been even fewer passengers during our primary study period between 2016-2017.
The travel incidence rates derived from data collected from the FL DOH and ECDC and the curated travelassociated cases from Florida are available at: https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_cuba-travelzika.
We collected air passenger volumes to calculate Zika and dengue virus travel incidence rates, to assess the potential for Zika virus importations into Cuba, and to investigate potential Zika virus spread from Cuba. From the IATA (IATA, 2018), we obtained the number of passengers traveling by air between all destinations in the Americas, plus to all global destinations from Cuba, from 2010-2017. IATA data consists of global ticket sales which account for true origins and final destinations, and represents 90% of all commercial flights. The remaining 10% of trips are modeled using airline market intelligence. One limitation of IATA data is it does not include chartered flights, which through our investigations, was only an issue for flights to and from the United States and Cuba. To make up for this, we obtained chartered flight data from Cuba to The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We used two data types-locally acquired cases by country and Florida travel cases by country-to inform estimates of per capita local incidence in Cuba on a scale comparable to local incidence in other countries. We limited our analysis of countries besides Cuba to those with a correlation between monthly local and travel cases >0.25 (n=27), which appeared to be a natural breakpoint in the distribution of correlations. For each, we used the fda (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fda/index.html) package in R to model per capita local incidence of Zika over time with univariate cubic B-spline functions with four knots per year for two years (2016-2017) described by parameters Ꭿ. We assumed that incidence among travelers from each country followed the same temporal pattern as local incidence but the two differed in magnitude by a factor Ꮃ, which could be due to differences in exposure or health-seeking behavior between international travelers and the general population. To estimate Ꭿ and Ꮃ for each of the 27 countries, we modeled local and travel incidence for each month as independent binomial random variables, with incidence as the number of ""successes"" and country population and number of travelers, respectively, as the number of ""trials."" Logit-transformed values of the spline functions informed the probability of success in each trial. Based on this likelihood formulation and with non-informative priors, we estimated Ꭿ and Ꮃ for each country using a Metropolis-Hastings implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We assessed convergence by calculating Gelman-Rubin statistics on five replicate chains, and we performed posterior predictive checks on cumulative local incidence (Fig. S2 ) and travel incidence (Fig. S3 ) (Thompson Hobbs and Hooten, 2015) . On the basis of Bayesian p-values < 0.05 on these posterior predictive checks, we removed four countries from subsequent analyses (leaving n=23 countries). To estimate per capita local incidence in Cuba, we first estimated Ꭿ for Cuba in a similar manner, but based on travel data only. We then took 10 4 values of Ꮃ drawn randomly from the posteriors of Ꮃ pooled across 23 countries and multiplied them by random samples from the posterior of per capita travel incidence curves from Cuba to obtain a set of 10 4 predictions of per capita local incidence curves for Cuba. R code and posterior samples are available at: https://github.com/andersen-lab/paper_2018_cuba-travelzika.
Zika virus RNA was sequenced using a highly multiplexed PCR approach, called PrimalSeq, that we previously described (Grubaugh et al., 2018b; Quick et al., 2017) . Detailed protocols, including the primer scheme ""ZIKV -Asia/America -400bp"" we used here to amplify Zika virus, can be found online (http://grubaughlab.com/openscience/amplicon-sequencing/ and https://andersenlab.com/secrets/protocols/). In brief, virus RNA (2 μL) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Invitrogen SuperScript IV VILO (20 µL reactions). Virus cDNA (2 μL) was amplified in 35 × ~400 bp fragments from two multiplexed PCR reactions using Q5 DNA High-fidelity Polymerase (New England Biolabs). Virus amplicons from the two multiplex PCR reactions were purified and combined (25 ng each) prior to library preparation. The libraries were prepared using the Kapa Hyper prep kit (Kapa Biosystems, following the vendor's protocols but with ¼ of the recommended reagents) and NEXTflex Dual-Indexed DNA Barcodes (BIOO Scientific, diluted to 250 nM). Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS beads (Omega) were used for all purification steps. The libraries were quantified and quality-checked using the Qubit (Thermo Fisher) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Paired-end 250 nt reads were generated using the MiSeq V2 500 cycle kits (Illumina).
Our open source software package, iVar (Grubaugh et al., 2018b) , was used to process the Zika virus sequencing data and call the consensus sequences. Source code and detailed documentation for iVar can be found at https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar. In brief, BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009 ) was used to align the paired-end reads to a reference genome (GenBank KX087101). The primer sequences were trimmed from the reads using a BED file, with the primer positions, followed by quality trimming. The consensus sequence was called by the majority nucleotide at each position with >10x coverage. All alignments and consensus sequences were visually inspected using Geneious v9.1.5 (Kearse et al., 2012) . The Zika virus sequences generated here can be found using the NCBI Bioproject PRJNA438510.
All available complete or near complete Zika virus genomes of the Asian genotype from the Pacific and the Americas were retrieved from GenBank in August, 2018. A total of 283 Zika virus genomes collected between 2013 and 2018 from Cuba (n = 10, including 9 generated in this study) and elsewhere from the Pacific and the Americas (n = 273, including 4 generated in this study from Florida, .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/496901 doi: bioRxiv preprint USA) were codon-aligned together using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inspected manually.
To determine the temporal signal of the sequence dataset, a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was first reconstructed with RAxML (Stamatakis, 2014) using the general time-reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model and gamma-distributed rates amongst sites (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003; Yang, 1994) . Then, a correlation between root-to-tip genetic divergence and date of sampling was conducted in TempEst (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003; Rambaut et al., 2016; Yang, 1994) . Timescaled phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework available in BEAST v1.10.2 . Accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty, we used an HKY+Γ4 nucleotide substitution model for each codon position, allowing for relative rates between these positions to be estimated, and an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model, with an underlying lognormal distribution (Drummond et al., 2006) , a non-parametric demographic prior (Gill et al., 2013) and otherwise default priors in BEAUti v1.10.2 . The MCMC analysis was run for 800 million iterations, sampling every 100,000th iteration, using the BEAGLE library v2.1.2 to accelerate computation (Ayres et al., 2012) . MCMC performance was inspected for convergence and for sufficient sampling using Tracer v.1.7.1 . After discarding the first 200 million iterations as burn-in, virus diffusion over time and space was summarised using a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using TreeAnnotator . Tree visualizations were generated with the Phylo (Talevich et al., 2012) module from Biopython and matplotlib (Hunter, 2007) .

Temperature is an important predictor of Ae. aegyptiborne virus transmission, as it affects mosquito population sizes (i.e. mosquito development, survival, and reproduction rates), interactions between mosquitoes and human hosts (i.e. biting rates), and mosquito transmission competence (i.e. mosquito infection and transmission rates) (Caminade et al., 2016; Mordecai et al., 2017; Siraj et al., 2017) . Virus transmission by Ae. aegypti can occur between 18-34°C and peaks at 26-29°C (Mordecai et al., 2017) . To assess yearly and seasonal variations in Ae. aegypti transmission potential for dengue and Zika virus, we used a temperature-dependent model of transmission using a previously developed R 0 framework (Mordecai et al., 2017) . By focusing this analysis on Havana, we controlled for spatial drivers of transmission and thereby isolated a representative example of temporal patterns in transmission potential. Using hourly temperature data obtained from OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/), we calculated monthly mean temperature and used it to calculate monthly R 0 as estimated by Mordecai et al. (Mordecai et al., 2017) (https://figshare.com/s/b79bc7537201e7b5603f). Doing so for 5,000 samples from the posterior of temperature-R 0 relationships and normalizing between 0 and 1 yielded a description of relative Ae. aegypti transmission potential per month in Havana, Cuba during 2014-2017. Aggregated monthly weather data for and model outputs are available at: https://github.com/andersenlab/paper_2018_cuba-travel-zika.
To investigate the potential for Zika virus transmission and establishment, we used previously generated Ae. aegypti suitability maps (Kraemer et al., 2015) based on the statistical relationships between mosquito presence and environmental correlates (Bogoch et al., 2016) . Maps were produced at a 5-km × 5-km resolution for each calendar month and then aggregated to the level of the U.S. states, countries, and territories, as used previously (Gardner et al., 2018) . Relative Ae. aegypti suitability (i.e. very low, low, mid-high, and high) was then derived by using the mean aggregated values for each U.S. state, country, and territory, and also the mean value for the study period (June-December, 2017). The U.S. state, country, and territory suitability means and standard deviations can be found at: https://github.com/andersenlab/paper_2018_cuba-travel-zika.

The first discovered cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA from SARS coronavirus named CoV-cpsR-22 contained 22 nucleotides perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence. Small RNA sequencing (small RNA-seq or sRNA-seq) is used to acquire thousands of short RNA 58 sequences with lengths of usually less than 50 bp. With sRNA-seq, many novel non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) 59 have been discovered. For example, two featured series of rRNA-derived RNA fragments (rRFs) constitute a 60 novel class of small RNAs [1] . Small RNA-seq has also been used for virus detection in plants [2] [3] [4] and 61
invertebrates [5] . In 2016, Wang et al. first used sRNA-seq data from the NCBI SRA database to prove that 62 sRNA-seq can be used to detect and identify human viruses [6] , but the detection results were not as good as 63 those of plant or invertebrate viruses. To improve virus detection in mammals, our strategy was to detect and 64 compare featured RNA fragments in plants, invertebrates and mammals using sRNA-seq data. In one 65 previous study [7] , we detected siRNA duplexes induced by plant viruses and analyzed these siRNA 66 duplexes as an important class of featured RNA fragments. In this study, we detected siRNA duplexes 67 induced by invertebrate and mammal viruses a n d unexpectedly discovered another important class of 68 featured RNA fragments, which were complemented palindrome small RNAs (cpsRNAs). Among all the 69 detected cpsRNAs, we found a typical 22-nt cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA from SARS 70 coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain MA15, which deserved further studies because mice infected with SARS-71
CoV MA15 died from an overwhelming viral infection with virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes 72 and ciliated epithelial cells [8] . Although the palindromic motif TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA was 73 already observed in a previous study [9] , it never be considered to be transcribed as cpsRNAs before our 74 studies. 75
The first discovered cpsRNA named SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 contained 22 nucleotides perfectly 76 matching its reverse complementary sequence. In our previous study of mitochondrial genomes, we had 77 reported for the first time a 20-nt palindrome small RNA (psRNA) named hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 [10]. The 78 biological functions of hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 had been preliminarily studied in our previous study, while the 79 biological functions of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 were still unknown. In this study, we compared the features of 80 siRNA duplexes induced by mammal viruses with those induced by plant and invertebrate viruses and found 81 that siRNA duplexes induced by mammal viruses had significantly lower percentages of total sequenced 82 reads and it seemed that they were only produced from a few sites on the virus genomes. One possible 83 reason could be a large proportion of sRNA-seq data is from other small RNA fragments caused by the 84 presence of a number of dsRNA-triggered nonspecific responses such as the type I interferon (IFN) 85 synthesis [11] . Another possible reason could be the missing siRNA duplexes or siRNA fragments functions 86 in cells by interaction with host RNAs or proteins. Based on this idea, we suspected that SARS-CoV-cpsR-87 22 could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or pathogenicity. Then, we performed RNAi experiments to test 88 the cellular effects induced by SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 and its segments. 89
In this study, we reported for the first time the existence of cpsRNAs. Further sequence analysis 90 supported that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 could originate from bat betacoronaviruses.

In this study, 11 invertebrate viruses were detected using 51 runs of sRNA-seq data (Supplementary 100 file 1) and two mammal viruses (H1N1 and SARS-CoV) were detected using 12 runs of sRNA-seq data. In 101 our previous study, six mammal viruses were detected using 36 runs of sRNA-seq data [6] . The detection of 102 siRNA-duplexes by 11 invertebrate and eight mammal viruses was performed using a published program in 103 our previous study [7] . Then, we compared the features of siRNA duplexes induced by invertebrate viruses 104 ( Figure 1A ) with those induced by plant viruses ( Figure 1B) . The results showed that the duplex length was 105 the principal factor to determine the read count in both plants and invertebrates. 21-nt siRNA duplexes were 106 the most abundant duplexes in both plants and invertebrates, followed by 22-nt siRNA duplexes in plants 107 but 20-nt siRNA duplexes in invertebrates. 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 2-nt overhangs were the most 108 abundant 21-nt duplexes in plants, while 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 1-nt overhangs were the most abundant 109 21-nt duplexes in invertebrates but they had a very close read count to that of 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 2-110 nt overhangs. 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt and 22-nt siRNA duplexes in invertebrates had much higher percentages of 111 total sequenced reads that those in plants. In addition, 18-nt and 19-nt siRNA duplexes had very close read 112 counts and 20-nt and 22-nt siRNA duplexes had very close read counts in invertebrates. Since siRNA 113 duplexes induced by mammal viruses had significantly lower percentages of total sequenced reads, the 114 comparison of siRNA-duplex features between mammals and invertebrates/or plants could not provide 115 meaningful results using the existing public data with standard sequencing depth. However, as an 116 unexpected result from siRNA-duplex analysis, we discovered cpsRNAs from invertebrate and mammal 117 viruses. 118
One typical cpsRNA UCUUUAACAAGCUUGUUAAAGA (DQ497008: 25962-25983) located in the 119 orf3b gene on the SARS-CoV strain MA15 genome was detected in four runs of sRNA-seq data (SRA: 120 SRR452404, SRR452406, SRR452408 and SRR452410). This cpsRNA was named SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, 121 which contained 22 nucleotides perfectly matching its reverse complementary sequence (Figure 2A) . We 122 also detected one 18-nt and one 19-nt segment of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, which could also be derived from 123 siRNA duplexes ( Figure 2B ) but their strands (positive or negative) could not be determined. Among 124 SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 and its two segments, the 19-nt segment was the most abundant and the 22-nt SARS-125
CoV-cpsR-22 was the least abundant. 126 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/185876 doi: bioRxiv preprint
Palindromic motifs are found in published genomes of most species and play important roles in 129 biological processes. The well-known samples of palindromic DNA motifs include restriction enzyme sites, 130 methylation sites and palindromic motifs in T cell receptors [12] . In this study, we found that palindromic or 131 complemented palindrome small RNAs motifs existed ubiquitously in animal virus genomes, but not all of 132 them were detected to be transcribed and processed into cpsRNAs probably due to inadequate sequencing 133 depth of the sRNA-seq data. For example, we only found two psRNAs ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/185876 doi: bioRxiv preprint
All sRNA-seq data were downloaded from the NCBI SRA database. The invertebrate and mammal 201 viruses were detected from sRNA-seq data using VirusDetect [4] and their genome sequences were 202 downloaed from the NCBI GenBank database. The description of sRNA-seq data and virus genomes is 203 presented in Supplementary file 1. The cleaning and quality control of sRNA-seq data were performed 204 using the pipeline Fastq_clean [15] that was optimized to clean the raw reads from Illumina platforms. 205
Using the software bowtie v0.12.7 with one mismatch, we aligned all the cleaned sRNA-seq reads to viral 206 genome sequences and obtained alignment results in SAM format for detection of siRNA duplexes using the 207 program duplexfinder [7] . Statistical computation and plotting were performed using the software R v2.15.3 208 with the Bioconductor packages [16] . The orf3b gene from human betacoronavirus (GenBank: 209 DQ497008.1), its 20 homologous sequences from bat betacoronavirus and nine homologous sequences from 210 civet betacoronavirus were aligned using ClustalW2 (Supplementary file 2) . After removal of identical 211 sequences, the orf3b gene from human betacoronavirus, eight homologous sequences from bat 212 betacoronavirus and two homologous sequences from civet betacoronavirus were used for phylogenetic 213 analysis. Since these homologous sequences had high identities (from 85.16% to 99.78%) to the orf3b gene 214 from DQ497008, the Neighbor Joining (NJ) method was used for phylogenetic analysis. 215 216
Based on the shRNA design protocol [1], the sequences of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, its 16-nt, 18-nt, 19-nt 218 20-nt segments ( Figure 2B ) and their control ""CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA"" were selected to use as 219 target sequences for pSIREN-RetroQ vector construction (Clontech, USA), respectively. PC-9 cells were 220 divided into six groups named 22, 16, 18, 19, 20 and control for transfection using plasmids containing 221 20 -nt segments and control sequences. Each group had three 222 replicate samples for plasmid transfection and cell apoptosis measurement. Each sample was processed 223 following the same procedure described below. At 12 h prior to transfection, the PC-9 cells were washed 224 with PBS and trypsinized. Gbico RPMI-1640 medium was added into the cells, which were then centrifuged 225 at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C to remove the supernatant. Gbico RPMI-1640 medium (Thermo Fisher 226 Scientific, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to adjust the solvent to reach a volume of 2 227 μ L and contain 2 ╳ 10 5 cells. These cells were seeded in one well of a 6-well plate for plasmid transfection. 
All the cleaned sRNA-seq reads were aligned to viral genome sequences using the software bowtie v0.12.7 310 with one mismatch. The detection of siRNA duplexes was performed using the program duplexfinder [7] . A. 311

Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many 12 population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 2,500 cases, occurred among 13 the Rohingya population between September and December 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological 14 parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness 15 of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent 16 outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of 17 the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance 18 of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low 19 vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks.

Figure 1 : Schematic representation of disease states in a model of a measles outbreak in Cox's Bazar. Individuals are either susceptible to measles (S), infectious with measles (I), or recovered from and immune to measles infection (R), either due natural immunity from infection or prior vaccination. β represents the transmission coefficient, γ is the recovery rate, and µ is the birth and death rate. The model starts with one infected (and infectious) measles case (i.e., I(0) = 1). The number of recovered individuals at time = 0 was calculated as R(0) = N − S(0) − I(0). The model tracks the number of individuals that move between the compartments each day and is run for one year using the ordinary differential equations 1-3.
The transmission coefficient, β, was estimated according to the relationship β = R0/N D, where N is the total 93 population (i.e., S + I + R) and D is the average duration of infectiousness ( The model uses one infected case as the initial value for the number of individuals in the infected compartment, I(0).
The initial value for the recovered compartment was calculated as (Table 1) . The model runs for 365 days to reflect one year following the start of the outbreak.
LHS was used to take into account uncertainty in parameter estimates; 1,000 values for each parameter were sampled 105 from the assumed parameter probability distributions (Table 1)

Table 1 reports all parameters and calculations used as inputs in the mathematical model. LHS was again used 113 to take into account uncertainty in parameter estimates. 114 For this analysis, the SIR model was run for two years to estimate the impact of vaccination on the next outbreak.
The cumulative number of cases over two years was calculated for vaccination coverage rates of 10%, 50%, and 90% of 116 the at-risk population. Cumulative cases were estimated as the cumulative proportion of the population that moves 117 into the infectious compartment in the SIR framework. Distributions of our estimates for the cumulative number of 118 cases at two years under the different vaccination rate scenarios are presented. To contrast these results with the 119 scenario of the next measles outbreak in the absence of vaccination, the same model used to estimate the size of the 120 2017 outbreak in the absence of vaccination was used with two changes: 1) the total population size was increased to 121 870,534 [1] , and 2) the proportion of the population that was assumed to be susceptible at the start of the outbreak 122 was estimated as su instead of s0 (Table 1) Figure 3 ). Vaccination therefore has the potential to avert between approximately 4,000 and 19,000 cases over two 160 years depending on the coverage rate. Figure 4B shows estimates in terms of boxplots to reflect the uncertainty in 161 our model's results due to parameter uncertainty. . 167 We find that nearly 77,000 cases were averted over the course of one year due to vaccination in the 2017 outbreak.

091a8e9a61e19e88caeb039f0e3888d111b20439,"Based on publicly released data for 1212 patients, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan of China. The following findings are obtained: 1) COVID-19 patients in Henan show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences, possible causes were explored; 2) Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days; Incubation periods of 92% patients were no more than 14 days; 3) The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages and showed high correlations with the numbers of patients that recently return from Wuhan; 4) Network analysis on the aggregate outbreak phenomena of COVID-19 revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various people's Hospital are the main force in treating patients. The related investigations have potential implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Arising from Wuhan South China seafood market at the end of the year 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia (Named as COVID-19 by WHO since February 11, 2020) has spread for more than one months, and it has directly resulted to more than 74600 confirmed patients, and 2121 people dead till February 20, 2020 [1] - [19] . Various investigations and reports reveal that the COVID-19 is different from the SARS in the year 2003 from the following aspects [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] : 1) Higher Infection rate; 2) With incubation period; 3) Incubation period is infectious; 4) Low lethality rate; 5) High mortality among the elderly patients that are with underlying diseases. These features result the prevention and control of COVID-19 to be a difficult task.
As a double-side sword, modern traffic and communication technologies greatly shortage the distances among people and provide convenience for human beings, however, they also facilitate the rapidly and widely spreading of epidemic diseases or rumors [12] . Since January 23, Wuhan has taken strict measures to close the city, and many other places have adopted various measures in succession to prevent the spreading of COVID-19, such as blocking traffic and putting suspicious ones in quarantine. After the outbreak of COVID-19, researchers have paid great efforts on the investigations of COVID-19, including its control and prediction [1] - [18] . Initial investigations pointed out that bats are mostly the source of the virus [3] , and Manis pentadactyla is a potential intermediate host of . The related investigations have great implications on the prevention, control and vaccine development [20] - [30] . Some recent publications have reported the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . To prevent the spreading of COVID-19, the centers for disease control and prevention (CDCs) of many provinces have timely released the data of confirmed cases, which facilitate us to explore the epidemiological and statistical characteristics of patients with COVID-19, and to understand the current situation and characteristics of the epidemic.
As a neighbor of the Hubei province, Henan province is with a large population size, and it is also one of the hardest hit areas of the epidemic. The current total confirmed cases in Henan are only lower than Hubei and Guangdong. The statistical analysis on the patients data in Henan can help us to understand the epidemiological and clinical features of patients [17] . In this paper, based on data collected from CDCs at all levels in Henan, we will perform statistical analysis. Our data includes 1212 patients ranging from January 21 to February 14, 2020, and covering 18 regions of Henan province. We will try to answer the following questions: 1) the current situation and characteristics of the epidemic in the 18 regions of Henan; 2) The sex and age distributions of confirmed cases; 3) The estimation of incubation period of patients with COVID-19; 4) The correlation between the number of patients with Wuhan travel histories and the total number of confirmed cases; 5) Network analysis on aggregate outbreak phenomena. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will introduce our main results and methods; Sections 3 gives some discussions and conclusions of the paper.
From January 21 to February 14, 2020, totally 1212 confirmed cases have been released in Henan. The epidemic situation, time evolution of daily increased infected patients and cumulatively confirmed ones are shown in Fig.1 .
Based on Fig.1 , we see that the daily increment of patients reaches a peak value of 109 at February 3, 2020. After that, the daily increment of patients significantly decreases. Among the 18 regions of Henan province, Xinyang, Nanyang, Zhumadian, Zhengzhou, Shangqiu and Zhoukou encompass more confirmed cases than the other regions. Xinyang is still with the highest daily increment as compared with the other regions, which is the severely affected area in Henan. In fact, Xinyang, Nanyang and Zhumadian are all near Hubei-the worst affected province in China. It was reported that about five million people have left Wuhan since January 23. According to the investigation from Xu et al. [7, 8] , before Wuhan was closed at January 23, Xinyang, Zhengzhou, Nanyang, Zhumadian, Zhoukou, Shangqiu were ranked among the top-50 cities in China that received huge amount of Wuhan personnel. The number of virus carrier is supposed to be proportional to the received amount of Wuhan personnel, which may be one of the main reasons that why the mentioned regions in Henan are so severely affected.
Among the 1212 patients, we abstract the gender information of 1158 patients (95.54% of total samples) and the age information of 1156 patients (95.38% of total samples). From the perspective of both the whole province and its 18 regions, we performed detailed statistical analysis, which are summarized in Fig.2 .
Statistical results reveal that 637 out of the 1158 patients are male, which accounts for 55% and apparently higher than females (Fig.2 A) , although there are slightly differences among different regions .

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026112 doi: medRxiv preprint ( Fig.2 B) . We guess that there are three possible reasons that may result to such gender difference. Firstly, males may be more active and with wider social activities than females, which increases their risk to infect COVID-19. Secondly and may be the most reasonable, an existing medical investigation reported that the expression and distribution of angiotension converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was wider in male patients than those in females [5] . Similarly to SARS-CoV, it is reported that COVID-19 invades human body through the ACE2 receptor. Based on single cell RNA sequencing technology, researchers have investigated the expression profiles of ACE2 in two male and six female patients with COVID-19 from single cell resolution, and they found that the expression of ACE2 was correlated with gender. The proportion of ACE2 expressed cells is higher in males than in females (1.66% vs. 0.41%) [5] . Besides, the distribution of ACE2 was also wider in males than that in females. Zhao et al. [5] reported that there were at least five different types of cells in the lungs of males with the expression of the ACE2 receptors, while the number was about 2 ∼ 4 in female patients. This may be one of the deep reasons that why male patients were higher than the female ones. Thirdly, one may doubt that the distribution difference may be caused by population structure. To verify whether the male to female ratio (MFR) affects the finding, based on the statistical yearbook report of Henan province in the year 2019, the MFR in the whole province was 1.0126 : 1, which has great difference with the male to female patients ratio (MFPR) (637 : 521 = 1.2226 : 1). Moreover, we perform correlation analysis for the two ratios in the 18 regions, the two ratios show very weak correlation, with Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.1555 ( Fig.2 C) . Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test [31] on the MFR and MFPR in the 18 regions also shows that the two have significant difference (KS = 0.6111, p = 0.0018 < 0.05). Thus, we speculate that the MFR has no apparent effect on the MFPR. In conclusion, the former two reasons may be the driven force that there was gender difference in confirmed patients.
The age distribution of patients in the whole province or each region all roughly follows normal distribution ( Fig.2 D, E). Patients aged between 21 and 60 years old take up more than 81% (938 out of 1156). The main reason may be that people aged between 21 and 60 years old are the social main labor forces, there are many migrant workers in this age interval. Moreover, they may have wider social circles than the others. Therefore, people aged between 21 and 60 years old are key crowd with high risks of COVID-19.
Traditionally, incubation period is defined as the period between the infection of an individual by a pathogen and the manifestation of the illness or disease it causes [32, 33] . Different infectious diseases have different incubation periods. However, for a certain infectious disease, its incubation period is relatively fixed. Since the number of pathogens entering the body, virulence and reproductive capacity, as well as power of resistance are different for different people, thus, it is reported that the incubation periods obtained from patients for a certain disease should follow logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] . Generally, incubation period can be measured by physiological observations and biological experiments [33] . The determination of incubation period has great implications for disease transmission control and policy making.
The estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19 is a very difficult task. The main difficulty is in that it is difficult to determine the infected time. Based on patients' information, some works have reported the incubation period of COVID-19. For example, Yang et al. [4] reported that the median incubation period of COVID-19 is 4.75 days; the interquartile range is 3.0 − 7.2 days. Hereinafter, we try to estimate the incubation period of patients in Henan. The collected data are with varied quality, many descriptions of patients only told us when the person left Wuhan, or When she/he had suspicious contacts with persons from Wuhan or suspicious persons (Following, we call they are exposed). To facilitate us to estimate the incubation period, we define estimated incubation period as the period from the date of exposure to the date of appearing clinical symptoms or making a definite diagnosis. Apparently, such definition overestimates the actual incubation period. For example, the information from a patient .

Indegree Outdegree Nodes at the two ends of an edge correspond to the exposed date and the date with clinical symptoms or confirmed infected. Edges represent the transfer from the two dates, and thicknesses of edges are proportional to the numbers of patients. Self-loops mean that the dates for exposure and appearing clinical symptoms or confirmed infected were the same. D. Weighted indegree and outdegree distributions of the directed graph that was shown in C. Weighted indegree denotes the total number of patients with clinical symptoms or confirmed infected; while weighted outdegree represents the total number of exposed persons that will be confirmed to be infected later.
(Mr Zhou, No.2 patients in Nanyang) in Nanyang says that his son left Wuhan and arrived at home at January 6, he and his son were all disease-free for a long period. Until February 3, he became sick and was quickly confirmed with infection of COVID-19. His son was disease-free till now. From our definition of incubation period, his incubation period will be 28 days, which is surprisingly high. We note that, our definition of estimated incubation period may be a little higher than the actually case, since we can not exclude the cases that the person has contacted some other people that carried the COVID-19. That is, we cannot know who was the intermediate spreader (unknown person B), and when she/he transmitted the virus from person A to person C.
Among the collected data, the incubation periods of 483 confirmed patients can be estimated. Statistical results are shown in Fig.3 and Tab.1. The estimated incubation periods for the 483 patients roughly follow the logarithm normal distribution, with a long right tail. Specifically, the 483 confirmed patients were with average estimated incubation periodτ D = 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days (50 out of the 483 cases) and the median was 7 days (48 out of the 483 cases). About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods.
Due to the definition, the estimated incubation periods in this paper may be longer than the real cases. However, the distribution has some implications. It indicates that a few patients may be with very long incubation period, which increase the difficulty to control and prevent the COVID-19.

To theoretically model the incubation period, we suppose the incubation period τ follows the logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] :
That is, the probability density function (PDF) of τ can be written as
Here, µ, σ 2 are two parameters that can be estimated from data. We consider three different approaches to estimate the parameters µ and σ 2 , including the moment estimation (ME), the ordinary least square (OLS) estimation and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) [34] . As to the ME, based on the PDF of incubation period τ , we can easily obtain E(τ ) = exp µ + σ 2 /2 , D(τ ) = (e σ 2 − 1)exp 2µ + σ 2 . Using the fsolve function (which is based on the OLS method) in Matlab, we obtainμ m = 1.8239, σ 2 m = 0.3629. The fitted PDF curve can be found in Fig.3 A, and some theoretical estimations of the incubation period based on the ME method are summarized in Tab.1.
Similarly, for the OLS estimation, µ and σ 2 can be estimated from the following optimization objective function:
Here, p i = n i /n denotes the ratio of patients with incubation period i(i = 0, 1, ..., m) (totally m+1 unique incubation periods), which can be easily computed from the 483 patients (n=483). f (t i ) corresponds to the PDF with incubation period t i , which is a function of the unknown parameters µ and σ 2 . Since τ = 0 in Eq.(2.2), we omit the case τ = 0 (only 29 cases were with τ = 0). By solving the optimization problem (2.5), we obtainμ o = 2.0723, σ 2 o = 0.5929. For the MLE, the estimation of µ and σ 2 can be obtained from minimizing the following negative logarithmic likelihood function.

Similarly to OLS, the case with τ = 0 will be not considered. Finally, we obtain
The fitted curves from the three methods are shown in Fig.3 A. Comparing among the three methods, it seems that the fitted curve from the ME method has the smallest variance, the variances of the OLS and MLE approaches are both very high. High variance indicates higher proportions of patients with long incubation periods. The ME method may well mimic the actual long right tail of the incubation period, while the OLS estimation could well describe the cases with middle incubation periods (incubation periods 2 ∼ 14). The MLE approach seems in between the ME and OLS approaches. The estimated interquartile range from the ME method is [4.1495, 9.3523] , which closes to the result from the 483 patients ( [4, 11] ).
The theoretical modeling of incubation period further illustrates that the incubation period may follow the logarithmic normal distribution. Moreover, it can be used to estimate the actual statics of incubation periods, and provide valuable references for decision-making.
The epidemic of COVID-19 in Henan has undergone three stages (Fig.3 C and D) . For the first stage that before January 13, both exposed and confirmed patients were not so much, the number of exposed (outdegree) ones were more than the confirmed ones (indegree). While for the second stage that between January 13 and January 23, the COVID-19 was in outbreak period, both exposed and confirmed ones were considerable, and the number of exposed ones are far more than the confirmed ones. During this period, many college students and migrant workers in Wuhan return their hometown, the large number of people flow from Wuhan increased the risks of exposure and infection. After January 23, the epidemic entered the third stage, the number of daily confirmed cases were apparently higher than exposed ones, and the confirmed cases roughly decreased with time. This may be attributed to the adoption of prevention and control measures. With the closing of the Wuhan city at January 23, many regions of Henan quickly adopt very strict measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19. Thus, after January 23, the number of exposed ones became fewer and fewer (Fig.3 D) , which is a good phenomena, indicating that the prevention and control measures become to gradually at work.
For the 18 regions of Henan province, we also summarized the numbers of currently confirmed patients with Wuhan travel histories (denoted as vector X 1 ), the numbers of patients without Wuhan travel histories (X 2 ), the numbers of patients that have contacts with persons from Wuhan (X 3 ), as well as the numbers of patients that are without Wuhan travel histories, but who have contacts with suspicious persons (X 4 ). The barplots for the numbers of the four categories of patients in the 18 regions are shown in Fig.4 A (In total of 1149 patients were known with or without Wuhan travel histories). Among patients with Wuhan travel histories, the released information of 250 patients contained transportation information. We found that 46% of the 250 patients have recently traveled by train or by bus, these patients may transmit the COVID-19 to a lot of people that in the same train or bus.
For the 18 regions, we investigate the correlation between the currently total numbers of confirmed patients (Y ) with X 1 − X 4 respectively. The heatmap of the correlation matrix is shown in Fig.4C . It reveals that Y has the highest correlation with X 1 , the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two is 0.9643, the fitted regression equation [35] is Y = 1.8146X 1 + 9.0920.
(2.8)
Such linear relationship statistically holds (F = 212.31, p < 0.0001, R 2 = 0.9299). However, though there are certain correlation between Y and X 2 − X 4 , their strength of correlations are all lower than .

This indicates that persons with Wuhan travel histories have high risks of infection with COVID-19, and regions with more such persons tend to encompass more patients infected with COVID-19.
From the 1212 patients, we constructed a heterogeneous network and performed some analysis on such network (Fig.5 ). The network contains 1105 patients that have been treated in 248 hospitals, 123 interhospital transfer relationships that involved 206 patients, and 208 patients that were clustering infected. Nodes in the network include patients and hospitals. Edges among patients represent relationship between relatives, friends or colleagues; Edges between patients and hospitals denote the patients were treated in the related hospitals; while edges among hospitals indicate the inter-hospital transfer treatments. Sizes of nodes were proportional to nodes' degree. Thickness of edges was proportional to the numbers of patients. From Fig.5 , we see that a few hospitals encompass a large number of patients in treatments, and the aggregate outbreak phenomena were ubiquitous. For example, the five patients that are treated in Zhengzhou Jinshui General Hospital are relatives to each other, they were successively infected. Similarly, 12 patients in Kaifeng are also relatives to each other. In fact, totally 208 patients were clustering infected, and Zhengzhou, Shangqiu, Zhoukou, Xuchang and Luoyang encompassed the most aggregative outbreak patients. Among the designated hospitals in Henan province, people's hospitals in different cities encompass a great number of patients. Xinyang Fifth People's Hospital received the most patients in Henan, followed by the Zhengzhou Sixth People's Hospital and the Luoshan County People's Hospital. Network analysis can provide us important information about patients, hospitals and their relationships; it can also provide valuable guidance for the distribution of epidemic prevention materials.
Through collection of publicly released patients information by various CDCs in Henan province during January 21 to February 14 of 2020, we performed statistical analysis on 1212 confirmed patients infected with COVID-19. The number of newly confirmed cases reached its peak at February 3, and it started .

Among the 18 regions of Henan, Xinyang is with the heaviest epidemic, and it is currently also with the highest daily increment. We found that 55% patients in Henan were male, which is apparently higher than the females. We found that the gender difference of patients in Henan is 1.2226 : 1, while from Yang et al. [4] , they reported that the gender difference for 4021 patients from over 30 provinces is 0.31 : 0.27 = 1.1481 : 1. Our result is close to the existing ones. We reported that the MFRs of the whole province and its 18 regions are not the main factor that results to the gender difference in patients. Two possible main factors that result to such gender difference of patients include 1) the expression and distribution of ACE2s were wider in male patients than those in females, and 2) males are more active and with wider social activities than females in many regions of Henan. The ages of patients generally follow normal distribution, and with more than 81% patients are aged between 21 and 60 years old. N a n y a n g C e n tr a l H o s p . Incubation period is very important but very difficult to be estimated, since it is difficult to know when the patients were infected. We define the period from firstly contacting with suspicious persons or recently return from Wuhan to firstly appearing clinical symptoms (fever, cough etc) as incubation period, and we estimate its distribution. Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the average estimated incubation period was 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days. About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods. Based on ME, OLS and MLE approaches, we modeled the incubation period as logarithmic normal distributions, and we found the ME method can well mimic the long right tails of the PDF for the incubation periods. Based on the ME approach, interquartile range of theoretically estimated incubation period is between 4.1 and 9.4 days. It is noted that, due to .

We also find that the numbers of patients with recent Wuhan travel histories are highly correlated with the total numbers of confirmed cases in the 18 regions of Henan. During our analysis, we consider the linear relationship between Y with each X i , which mainly for the purpose of avoiding multicollinearity [34] among X i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) . Furthermore, we perform network analysis on aggregate outbreak phenomena of COVID-19 in Henan, we reported that 208 cases were clustering infected ones.

09b6706748f0c1ae0da436ac2dfac9052b84e4ea,"A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets 20 with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% 21 identity) to that of bat α-coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural 22 reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission 23 to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM 24 structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å 25 resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural 26 similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 27 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically 28 analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and 29 the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus spikes. The 30 results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most 31 ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion 32 is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV 33 S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results 34 structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV 35 and β-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species 36 transmission of coronaviruses. : bioRxiv preprint 39 Coronaviruses, categorized into the order Nidovirales family Coronaviridae and 40 subfamily Coronavirinae, are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range 1 . 41 Their infections in humans, other mammals and birds can cause respiratory, hepatic, 42 enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity 2 . The severe acute respiratory 43 syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 44 (MERS-CoV) have posed severe threats to human health in the 21 st century 1,3 . In the 45 meantime, coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic 46 losses 4 . For example, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) 47 (also known as SeACoV and PEAV) isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery 48 diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90% in several commercial pig farms 49 in Guangdong Province of China 5-10 . SADS-CoV is an α-coronavirus and other 50 representative members in the α-genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 51 (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), porcine respiratory 52 coronavirus (PRCV), human NL63 and 229E coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-53 229E) 1 . Representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis 54 coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-55 OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the β-genus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in the 56 γ-genus and porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) in the δ-genus 1 . 57 Cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination and/or mutations 58 underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses 3,11-13 . Bats are the natural reservoir 59 of more than 30 different α-and β-coronaviruses that have great potential for 60 interspecies transmission by recombination and/or mutation 12,14-16 . Data on genetic 61 evolution, receptor binding and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human SARS-62 CoV and MERS-CoV most likely originate from bats 1 . Palm civets and dromedary 63 camels are the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from bats to humans 1 , 64
respectively. The newly identified porcine SADS-CoV isolates are also found to share 65 ~95% sequence identity with Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2, and this further 66 stressed the severe results of coronavirus spillover from bats to domestic animals 5-10 .","However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of SADS-CoV from 68 bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored. Recently it was shown 69 that SADS-CoV is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse, 70 chicken, pig, monkey and human, indicating a high potential of the SADS-CoV for 71 interspecies transmission 17 . 72 The spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host 73 receptor with the S1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the S2 74 subunit, thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism 18, 19 . As a class I viral 75 fusion protein, the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each 76 monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into S1 and 77 S2 subunits 18 . For most coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit HCoV-OC43 utilizes NTD to recognize glycans 29 ; and one exception is MHV, which 83 utilizes the NTD to bind mouse receptor CEACAM1a 30 . Therefore, the S1 subunit, 84 especially its NTD and CTD, is the most variable region of the spike, and is responsible 85 for different tropisms of coronaviruses. In comparison, the S2 subunit containing the 86 fusion peptide (FP) and heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) for membrane fusion are more 87 conserved in both sequence and structure 18, 19 . For the SADS-CoV, receptor analysis 88 indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ACE2, DPP4 89 and APN are essential for the cell entry 7,17 . There are also no reports regarding to the The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.961912 doi: bioRxiv preprint CoV 21,36-38 and MERS-CoV 36,39,40 ; the γ-coronavirus spike structure is determined for 98 IBV 41 and the δ-coronavirus spike structure is determined for PdCoV 42,43 . The cryo-99 EM structures of bat coronavirus spike trimers have not been reported, and only crystal 100 structures of the CTD from HKU4 44 , HKU5 45 and HKU9 46 were determined. 101 The spikes of SADS-CoV (1130 amino acid residues) and HKU2 (1128 amino 102 acid residues) are the shortest among all known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and 103 their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28%, 104 indicating the spikes of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are unique [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 47 . In this study, we report 105 the cryo-EM structures of the SADS-CoV and HKU2 spike trimers at 2.83 Å and 2.38 106 Å resolution, respectively. The HKU2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat 107 coronavirus. We analyzed the HKU2 and SADS-CoV trimer structures and also 108 compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit 
Protein expression and structure determination 116 The cDNAs encoding HKU2 spike (YP_001552236) and SADS-CoV spike 117 (AVM41569.1) were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression.
HKU2 ectodomains (residues 1-1066) and SADS-CoV ectodomains (residues 1-1068) 119 were separately cloned into pFastBac-Dual vector (Invitrogen) with C-terminal foldon 120 tag and Strep tag. After expression in Hi5 insect cells and purification to homogeneity, 121 the cryo-EM images on these two spike ectodomains were recorded using FEI Titan 122 Krios microscope operating at 300 KV with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector 123 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). About 1,400,000 particles for HKU2 spike and 900,000 124 particles for SADS-CoV spike were subjected to 2D classification, and a total of 125 421,490 particles of HKU2 spike and 152,334 particles of SADS-CoV spike were 126 author/funder.

The overall density maps were solved to 2.38 Å for HKU2 128 spike and 2.83 Å for SADS-CoV spike (gold-standard Fourier shell correlation = 0.143) 129 (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2) . The atomic-resolution density map 130 enabled us to build nearly all residues of HKU2 spike ectodomains (residues 17-995) 131 except for a few breaks (residues 129-141 and 204-204), as well as 48 N-linked glycans 132 (Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4a) . The final refined model of SADS-
CoV spike contains residues 19-998 with some short breaks (residues 134-143 and 488-134 490) and 45 N-linked glycans (Supplementary Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4b ).
135 Data collection and refinement statistics for these two structures are listed in Overall structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes 139 The overall structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes we determined here resemble 140 the previously reported pre-fusion structures of coronaviruses spikes. Both spike 141 trimers have a mushroom-like shape (~150 Å in height and ~115 Å in width) (Fig. 1a) , 142 consisting of a cap mainly formed by β-sheets of the S1 subunit, a central stalk mainly 143 formed by α-helices of the S2 subunit, and a root formed by twisted β-sheets and loops 144 of the S2 subunit (Fig. 1a) . In each trimer there is a C3 axis along the central stalk ( Fig.   145 1a). The amino acid identity between HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes is 86%, and these 146 two spike structures are quite similar with the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) 147 being 0.53 Å for 962 aligned Cα atoms of the monomer and 0.56 Å for 2886 aligned 148 Cα atoms of the trimer. Due to the high structural similarity, we will use the HKU2 149 structure to present the features of both spikes in the subsequent description, whereas 150 significant differences between them will be pointed out only when necessary.
The S1 subunit of the HKU2 spike comprises two major domains, NTD and CTD, 152 which are followed by two subdomains SD1 and SD2 connecting them to the S2 subunit 153 ( Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c) . The S1 subunits from three monomers form the cap of the spike, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.961912 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Fig. 1a) . The NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 of the S1 subunit are all mainly composed of 157 β strands regarding to the secondary structure feature (Fig. 1c) . In contrast, the upstream 158 helix (UH), fusion peptide (FP), connecting region (CR), heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 159 central helix (CH) of the S2 subunit are mainly composed of helices, whereas the β-160 hairpin (BH) and subdomain 3 (SD3) at the bottom part of the S2 subunit mainly consist 161 of β stands and loops (Fig. 1c) . Moreover, the residues after the SD3, which contain the The SD1 and SD2 of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit are highly similar in amino The NTD of HKU2 has three layers of antiparallel β-sheet with the top one consisting 182 of six strands, the middle one consisting of five strands and the bottom one consisting 183 of three strands. Below the bottom sheet is a short α-helix (Fig. 2a) . The top and middle 184 β-sheets form a galectin-like β-sandwich fold, which is inserted between two stands of 185 the bottom sheet (Fig. 2a) .

Besides, C 234 -C 244 (numbered in HKU2 and connecting the bottom helix 216 to the bottom sheet) is conserved in both subtype I and subtype II NTDs (Fig. 2b) .
The NTDs of β-coronaviruses including BCoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, 218 MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and MHV resemble the subtype I, rather than the subtype II 219 NTD in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds (Fig. 2c) . These β-220 coronavirus NTDs have additional loops in the N-terminus, between β1 and β2 strands, 221 and between β6 and β7 stands (numbered in HKU2 structure), forming an extensive The CTD of HKU2 has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β sheet as the core with 234 connecting loops between the stands (Fig. 3a) . It contains four disulfide bonds: C 277 -235 C 300 and C 285 -C 290 at the N-terminus, C 341 -C 397 at the C-terminus and the last one C 331 -236 C 369 connecting the β2 and β5 strands in the core β sheet (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, the 237 CTD core of HKU2 is of high structural similarity with the conserved CTD core of β-238 coronaviruses and the disulfide bonds in the CTD of HKU2 except for C 285 -C 290 are 239 also detected in all β-coronavirus CTDs (Fig. 3b) . These CTDs have the core of one 240 twisted β-sheet and here we name them as one-layer CTD subtype ( Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b ).
The β-coronavirus CTDs always have an insertion consisting of loops and/or stands 242 between the β5 and β6 strands of the core (Fig. 3b) .

In the CTD of HKU2, there is only one 245 short loop between the β5 and β6 strands of the core twisted β-sheet (Fig. 3a) . 246 Although as members in the α-genus, HKU2 and SADS-CoV CTD structures are 247 significantly different from those of other α-coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, 248 PEDV, TGEV and PRCV that contain two layers of β-sheets (Fig. 3c) . And we named 249 these CTDs as two-layer CTD subtype. All available two-layer CTD structures can be 250 well aligned with Cα r.m.s.d. in the range of 1.0-3.4 Å, except for the CTDs of HKU2 251 and SADS-CoV. These two-layer CTDs contain two highly conserved disulfide bonds: 252 C 540 -C 586 and C 569 -C 596 (numbered in PEDV CTD) (Fig. 3c ). The C 569 -C 596 is conserved 253 among all coronaviruses, whereas the C 540 -C 586 is conserved in all α-coronaviruses 254 (except for HKU2 and SADS) and δ-coronavirus PdCoV (Fig. 3c) .
The CTD of δ-coronavirus PdCoV have a core of two β-sheets, belonging to the 256 two-layer CTD subtype (Fig. 3c) . As for the γ-coronavirus IBV, the core of its CTD is 257 also similar to the typical two-layer CTD (Fig. 3c) . However, several β strands are The SD1 and SD2 are two subdomains following the CTD in the S1 subunit, linking 264 the CTD to the S2 subunit. The HKU2 SD1 is a partial β barrel consisting of five β 265 strands and a disulfide bond (C 409 -C 458 ) connecting its C-terminus to the β1 strand ( Fig.   266 4a). This five-stranded β barrel and the linking disulfide bond are conserved among all 267 four genera of coronavirus (Fig. 4a) . The HKU2 SD2 has a structure of two layers of 268 β-sheet with an additional short α-helix over the top sheet (Fig. 4b) . The additional α-269 helix and the top sheet is linked by a disulfide bond (C 482 -C 509 ), and another disulfide 270 bond (C 524 -C 533 ) links the C-terminal loop to the bottom sheet (Fig. 4b) .

Quaternary packing of the NTD and CTD in the spike 278 It has been observed that coronaviruses have two types of quaternary packing mode of 279 the S1 subunits in the trimer: intra-subunit packing and cross-subunit packing 41 .
Actually, this is mainly caused by different positioning and interaction between NTD 281 and CTD in the spike monomer. The HKU2 S1 subunit, similar to those in -282 coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, HCoV-226E and PEDV and -coronavirus PdCoV, have 283 an ""inward"" CTD which contacts with the NTD (Fig. 5a) . The three structural ""NTD-284 CTD"" modules in the cap region of these spikes are composed of NTD and CTD from 285 the same monomer, forming the intra-subunit packing in the spike trimer (Fig. 5a) . The 286 S1 subunits of other coronaviruses in the and -genera including MHV, SARS-CoV, 287 MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and IBV have an ""outward"" CTD that is far away from the 288 NTD (Fig. 5b) . Therefore, the three structural ""NTD-CTD"" modules in the cap region 289 of these spikes have the NTD from one monomer and the CTD from the adjacent 290 monomer, forming the cross-subunit packing in the spike trimer (Fig. 5b) . Interestingly, 291 we found that the ""outward"" CTDs always have an insertion in the core structure, such 292 as β-coronavirus CTDs and -coronavirus IBV CTD (Fig. 5b) . In contrast, all ""inward""
CTDs only have the one-layer or two-layer core structure without obvious inserted 294 region.
Conserved S2 subunit and a distinct CR 297 Sequence analysis suggested that the S1/S2 protease cleavage site at the boundary 298 between the S1 and S2 subunits is R544-M545 in HKU2 spike and R546-M547 in 299 SADS-CoV spike 5,8,47 . Compared to the S1 subunit, the topology and structure of S2 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.961912 doi: bioRxiv preprint (residues 748-836), a central helix (CH) (residues 837-887), a twisted β-hairpin (BH) 304 (residues 888-929) and a β-sandwich like SD3 (residues 930-995) (Fig. 1b and Fig. 6a) . 305 Like in other coronavirus spikes in the prefusion state, the model of HR2 after SD3 was 306 not built in the structure due to poor density. Five disulfide bonds in S2 are detected.
Two of them (C 590 -C 612 and C 595 -C 601 ) stabilize the folded helices of UH, C 696 -C 706 308 bends the CR, C 884 -C 895 links the CH and the BH, and C 934 -C 943 is within the SD3 (Fig.   309   6a ). The first four disulfide bonds are conserved in all coronaviruses, and the last one Fig. 4) . The typical CR 321 in the S2 subunit contains three helices and one short strand, with a disulfide bond 322 bending the first and second helix to form a turning (Fig. 6b) . In HKU2, the second 323 helix is replaced by a short strand (713-716) and the third helix is replaced by a loop 324 (721-741), therefore there are two short strands and only one helix in HKU2 CR (Fig.   325 6c). The conserved disulfide bond C 696 -C 706 makes the first helix of CR in HKU2 spike 326 turn upside down. The S2' cleavage site (between R671 and S672) is then covered by 327 the reversed CR helix and loops, and R671 interacts with E723 in the loop and K697 328 and K698 in helix 1 (Fig. 6c) . In other coronaviruses, taking the MHV S2 for example, 329 the helix 1 does not cover the S2' site (between R869 and S870), and R869 only loosely 330 interacts with T929 in helix 3 (Fig. 6b) . After the dissociation of the S1 subunit triggered 331 by receptor binding, the exposure of the S2' site for cleavage is a prerequisite for the 332 proteolytic activation of the coronavirus spike to mediate membrane fusion.

The HKU2 and SADS-CoV have one NTD in the S1 subunit, and their structures 358 are more similar to the NTD1 than the NTD2 of -coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and 359 PEDV, whereas the only NTD of HCoV-229E is structurally more similar to the NTD2 360 than the NTD1 (Fig. 2) . Therefore, we suggest that α-coronaviruses have two subtypes 361 of NTD. The evolution relationship between them are not clear yet. It was once 362 author/funder. All rights reserved.

However, the sequence identity between these two NTDs is only 15.7% 364 in HCoV-NL63 and 12.9% in PEDV. Considering that HKU2 (SADS-CoV) and 365 HCoV-229E have one NTD belonging to either subtype I or subtype II, a more plausible 366 evolution way of the NTD in α-coronaviruses is the recombination of two separate 367 primitive domains into the genome, resulting in the presence of two NTDs in the S1 368 subunit α-coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63 and PEDV. To be note, these two NTD However, we argue that the evolution pathways may not be in the order of α-, δ-, γ-, 384 and β-genus. A more plausible pathway is that the β-, γ-and δ-coronavirus NTDs may 385 evolve independently and parallelly from subtype I (β-and γ-coronavirus NTDs) or 386 subtype II (δ-coronavirus NTDs) (Supplementary Fig. 7b ).
The HKU2 and SADS-CoV CTD structure have a one-layer core consisting of a 388 twisted five-stranded antiparallel β sheet. Interestingly, -coronavirus CTDs also have 389 the similar one-layer core structure and three strictly conserved disulfide bonds are also 390 present in the core of HKU2 CTD.

09c9fcabc66a106e01ef42247cbd86b6d85bd67f,"24 A subset of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases diphtheria toxin-like (ARTDs, aka 25 mono-PARPs) is induced by type I interferons. Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral 26 activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-27 ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus 28 conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a 29 macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. 30 This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in 31 replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection 32 are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication 33 and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified 34 ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-35 dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein 36 nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a 37 functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction 38 of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a 39 decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This 40 suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a 41 hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We 42 hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found 43 that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing 44 polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized 45 by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic 46 explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. 47 Author Summary 48 Infectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever 49 new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased 50 human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause 51 world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic 52 rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs 53 are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic 54 function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-55 ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this 56 modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because 57 macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets. 58 59 Introduction 60 Upon viral infection host cells initiate an antiviral immune response. Because the regulation 61 of protein function through post-translational modifications (PTMs) is among the quickest 62 mechanisms to adapt to challenges such as viral infections, PTMs display an essential part of 63 antiviral signaling. Viruses have developed multifaceted strategies to evade or even hijack 64 cellular mechanisms, e.g. encoding proteins that regulate PTMs and thereby counteract the 65 antiviral reaction of the host [1-5]. Recent findings have elaborated on the role of intracellular 66 ADP-ribosylation at the host-pathogen interface [6-12]. ADP-ribosylation is an ancient PTM of 67 proteins and intracellularly mainly catalyzed by members of the ADP-ribosyltransferase 68 diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family (also known as poly-ADP-ribosylpolymerases (PARPs)), 69
which is composed of seventeen proteins [1, 13]. These enzymes use NAD + as co-factor to 70 transfer ADP-ribose onto a substrate protein with release of nicotinamide. Based on their 71 . : bioRxiv preprint 4 catalytic features the ARTDs are subdivided into three classes. The first class contains ARTD1, 72 2, 5, and 6, which are capable of transferring multiple ADP-ribose moieties in an iterative 73 process and thereby forming long polymers. This results in poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) 74 of substrate proteins. The second and largest class is defined by members that are restricted 75 to mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) (ARTD3, 4,(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(14)(15)(16)(17), whereas the third 76 group is defined by ARTD13, which lacks the ability to bind NAD + and thus is catalytically 77 inactive [18]. 78 79 PARylation, arguably best known for its function in DNA damage response, has also been 80 linked to chromatin organization, ribosome biogenesis, telomere maintenance, signaling 81 processes and cell death [1, 19, 20]. In contrast functions of MARylation are less well 82 understood but expanding with links to DNA damage repair, gene expression, signaling, stress 83 response and cell death [1, 21]. Recent findings indicate a role for MARylation in host-84 pathogen conflicts [1, 21, 22]. The expression of several mono-ARTDs is triggered by type I 85 interferons (IFNs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), like LPS, as part of an 86 innate immune response to pathogens [6, 8, 11,[23][24][25]. Among these mono-ARTDs are ARTD7, 87 ARTD10 and ARTD12, which have been identified to mediate clearance of Venezuelan Equine 88
Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) by interfering with viral replication [7, 8]. In line with this, Zika virus 89 replication is restricted by ARTD12 [26] . In addition to these molecular and cell-based studies, 90 evolutionary analysis suggests a role for several ARTD family members at the host-pathogen 91 interface, among them the macrodomain containing ARTDs (ARTD7-9) and ARTD13 [27]. 92
Although catalytically inactive, the latter is best studied for being restrictive for viral 93 replication by recognizing foreign CG-rich RNA through its Zinc finger domains [28, 29]. 94 95 .

This 120 protein is then cleaved into the 4 individual nsP1-4 that together form a functional replication 121 complex. The processing occurs auto-catalytically through the protease that is part of nsP2 122 [43] . Mutations interfering with protease activity result in defective CHIKV replication [44] . 123
Similarly, mutations interfering with the hydrolase activity, which is part of nsP3, abolish 124 replication [9] . However, in contrast to nsP2, the biological function of the nsP3 macrodomain 125 remains elusive. 126 127
Here we identified the interferon inducible mono-ARTDs, ARTD10 and ARTD12, as host factors 128 restricting CHIKV replication. ARTD10 and ARTD12, dependent on their catalytic activity, 129 prevent polyprotein processing. Similarly, the lack of a hydrolytically active macrodomain 130 results in defective polyprotein processing. We identified nsP2 as substrate for MARylation in 131 vitro and in cells. MARylation of nsP2 by ARTD10 inhibits its proteolytic activity, which 132 supports our observation of defective polyprotein processing. We demonstrate that the MAR 133 hydrolase activity associated with nsP3 removes the modification from nsP2, thereby 134 reactivating its proteolytic activity. Together, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for 135 the role of the CHIKV MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3 for viral replication and offers one 136 mechanism of how MARylation functions in host-virus conflicts. 137 138 139 140 .

This suggests that the capability 143 to reverse MARylation is essential for proper virus replication and that mono-ARTDs function 144 as antiviral host factors. To identify mono-ARTDs that potentially affect CHIKV replication we 145 performed knockdown experiments (Fig. 1a) . HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNA oligo 146 pools targeting IFNa-inducible mono-ARTDs (Supplementary Fig. 1a and [6] ), such as ARTD10, 147 ARTD12, ARTD8, or ARTD7, prior to transfection with CHIKV replicon RNA. This replicon 148 encodes the four non-structural proteins but lacks the open reading frame of the structural 149 proteins. Instead, the subgenomic promotor of the replicon controls the expression of Gaussia 150 luciferase, which we analyzed as surrogate for virus replication (Fig. 1b) [46] . Replication was 151 analyzed at 9, 24 and 30 hours post transfection (hpt) (Fig. 1a) . At the early time point ARTD10 152 and ARTD12 knockdowns showed a significant increase in replication, while the effect 153 decreased at later time points. Knockdowns of ARTD8 or ARTD7 only allowed for minor 154 increases in replication compared to control (Fig. 1a) . Based on these findings we decided to 155 focus on ARTD10 and ARTD12 and their role in CHIKV replication. We employed HEK293 cells 156 stably expressing TAP-tagged ARTD10 or ARTD12, either wildtype (wt) or catalytically inactive 157 mutants (Supplementary Fig 1b, c and [14] ), to test whether overexpression of these proteins 158 interferes with CHIKV replication (Fig. 1c-g) . Protein expression was induced by doxycycline 159 (Dox) treatment prior to transfection with replicon RNA. Doxycycline treatment itself had little 160 effect on CHIKV replication ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ), still control cells were always treated with 161 doxycycline as well. ARTD10 and ARTD12 reduced replication two-fold, while the respective 162 catalytically inactive variants, ARTD10-G888W(GW) or ARTD12-H564Y(HY), showed little 163 effect (Fig. 1c,d) , suggesting that the MARylation activity of these enzymes is required to 164 .

These differences are not attributed to variations in protein 165 levels, as the mutants were expressed more efficiently compared to the wt proteins (Fig. 1e, 166 Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Similarly, HEK293 cells transiently expressing ARTD10 or ARTD12 167 showed reduced replicon replication, whereas no influence of the PARylating ARTD1 or 168 ARTD14 enzymes, which do not respond to IFNa, was observed ( Supplementary Fig. 1e,f) . 169
Further analysis revealed that ARTD10 and ARTD12 had additive repressing effects on 170 replication when analyzed 30 hpt (Fig. 1f) . 171
To expand on these findings, we determined the effects of ARTD10 and ARTD12 on the 173 replication cycle of infectious CHIKV, which expresses EGFP from an additional subgenomic 174 promoter ( Fig. 1g) [47]. Overexpression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a significant 175 decrease of EGFP expressing cells as measured by flow cytometry 24 and 48 hpi ( Fig. 1g and 176 Supplementary Fig. 2 ). In this set-up, the catalytically inactive mutant of ARTD12 restricted 177 replication to the same extend as the wt protein, indicating that ARTD12 may have more than 178 one mode of action. In contrast, ARTD10-GW enhanced viral replication, hinting at a dominant 179 negative effect and thereby demonstrating dependency on catalytic activity of ARTD10 as a 180 CHIKV restriction factor. Of note is also that the inhibitory effects of ARTD10 and ARTD12 are 181 more pronounced at early time points (24 hpi) compared to later time points (48 hpi To gain insight into a possible mechanism of how MARylation by ARTD10 and ARTD12 might 187

Therefore, we made use of EGFP-encoding variants of the replicon ( 2 EGFP 189 and 3 EGFP, in which EGFP is integrated after amino acids 466 or 383 in nsP2 or nsP3, 190 respectively Fig. 1b and [48] ), enabling us to visualize processed nsP2 or nsP3 proteins using a 191 GFP-specific antibody (Fig. 2) . HEK293 cells stably expressing ARTD10 or ARTD10-GW were 192 employed. These cells were then transfected with or without ARTD12 expressing constructs 193 and induced for ARTD10 expression prior to transfection with 3 EGFP replicon RNA. The 194 analysis of whole cell lysates showed a reduction in processed nsP3 in presence of either the 195 enzymatically active ARTD12 or ARTD10. NsP3 was further reduced when both enzymes were 196 expressed (Fig. 2a) . These findings led us hypothesize that MARylation hampers polyprotein 197 processing. Proper polyprotein processing is a prerequisite for RNA replication [43], consistent 198 with impaired replication of a mutant replicon with an inactive protease (nsP2-C478A/S482A, 199 referred to as CASA) (Fig. 2b,c) [44]. Similarly, a functionally active macrodomain is needed for 200 replication as substitution of key amino acids in the macrodomain (D10A, V33E, for details 201 concerning the replicon construct see Fig. 1b ) interfered with replication ( Fig. 2b ,c) [6, 9] . To 202 analyze how the lack of a functional macrodomain compromised replication, we determined 203 the abundance of proteolytically processed nsP2 (Fig. 2d , for the specificity of the antibody 204 see Supplementary Fig. 3a ,b). As expected, nsP2 was detectable after transfection of the 205 wildtype (wt) but not the CASA mutant replicon (Fig. 2d) . Similarly, nsP2 was not detectable, 206 when expressed from hydrolase deficient replicons (Fig. 2d) , implying a defect in nsP2-207 mediated polyprotein processing in the absence of MAR hydrolase activity. This observation 208 was corroborated with the 3 EGFP and 2 EGFP replicons and mutants thereof ( Fig. 2e-g) . 209
Although replication of the EGFP-encoding variants was reduced compared to the wt replicon, 210 it remained dependent on functional protease and MAR hydrolase activities (Fig. 2e,f) . As for 211 nsP2, GFP-tagged processed nsP3 was not properly generated from the hydrolase deficient 212 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.07.896977 doi: bioRxiv preprint Then we examined whether replication could also be rescued by co-expression of plasmid-237 encoded nsP2 or nsP3 and the respective replicon mutant RNA (CASA or V33E) 238 ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Co-expression of the nsP2-459-798 protease domain partially rescued 239 replication of the CASA mutant suggesting that indeed polyprotein synthesis takes place 240 ( Supplementary Fig. 4a-c) . In contrast, co-expression of nsP3 or the isolated nsP3 241 macrodomain was not sufficient to rescue replication of a hydrolase deficient replicon mutant 242 (Supplementary Fig. 4d-f ). To overcome possible differences in the subcellular localization of 243 replication hubs and plasmid-expressed nsP3 macrodomain, we fused the macrodomain to an 244 anti-GFP-nanobody to enhance targeting to sites of replication of the EGFP encoding 245 replicons. We transfected HEK293 cells with plasmids coding for a GFP-nanobody-nsP3-246 macrodomain fusion protein prior to transfection with the 3 EGFP-replicon RNA. We analyzed 247 GFP by flow cytometry (Fig. 3i -k, Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Whereas the overall amount of GFP-248 positive cells when transfected with the V33E mutant was low compared to the wildtype and 249 stayed unaffected by co-expression of GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain (Fig. 3i) , we 250 observed an increase in GFP intensity dependent on hydrolytic activity of the GFP-nanobody 251 fusion protein (Fig. 3j, k, Supplementary Fig. 5 ). In line with this replication in presence of the 252 wildtype GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain was slightly but significantly increased (Fig. 3l) . 253
Further, the analysis of nsP3 revealed an increase in its processed form (Fig. 3m,n) , indicating 254 that the co-expression of the GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain at least to some extend was 255 able to rescue the CHIKV replicon lacking hydrolase activity. 256 257 Taken together, these data suggest strongly that polyprotein synthesis of the different 258 mutated replicons occurs and further support the hypothesis that MARylation affects 259 polyprotein processing. 260 .

Consequences of protein MARylation are poorly understood. Our previous studies indicated 262 that ARTD10-dependent MARylation impairs the catalytic activity of the kinase GSK3b, which 263 is antagonized by cellular MAR hydrolases [37, 49] . Furthermore, MARylation is reported to 264 affect protein-protein interactions, mRNA stability and translation [1]. Following our 265 hypothesis, we determined the consequences of MARylation on the protease activity of nsP2, 266 which is responsible for polyprotein processing [43] . Therefore, we tested whether nsP2 267 serves as substrate for mono-ARTDs. His6-tagged fusion proteins of CHIKV nsP2 or nsP2-459- We obtained similar results with nsP2 MARylated by full length ARTD10, while no MARylation 282 was obtained with ARTD10-GW (Fig. 4c ). In addition, nsP2 was reversibly MARylated by full 283 length ARTD12 (Fig. 4d ). To complement these in vitro findings, we measured MARylation of 284 .

The 285 immunoprecipitated nsP2-2 EGFP stained positively with a MAR binding reagent. In support, 286 this staining was reduced upon incubation with the recombinant nsP3 macrodomain, 287 providing evidence that this protein is MARylated in cells (Fig. 4e) . Similarly, upon co-288 transfection of a plasmid expressing GFP-nsP2 and the V33E replicon, nsP2 stained positively 289 for MAR (Fig. 4f) . Taken together, we identified CHIKV nsP2 as a new substrate for MARylation 290 in vitro and in cells in context of a viral infection. 291 292
Having identified nsP2 as a new substrate for MARylation, we aimed at determining the 294 consequences of this modification on proteolytic activity. Therefore, we established a 295 protease assay using an nsP3/nsP4 junctional peptide (DELRLDRAGG|YIFSS) fused to GST and 296 EGFP ( Fig. 5a ) [50] [51] [52] . Accessibility between the two globular tags was achieved by including 297 a polylinker C-terminally of the cleavage site. This artificial substrate was cleaved by the 298 recombinant nsP2 protease with up to 90% processing observed after 120 min, but not by the 299 CASA proteolytically inactive mutant (Fig. 5b ). Of note is that neither the C-terminal EGFP 300 fragment (fragment 1) nor the N-terminal GST fragment (fragment 2) were further cleaved, 301 supporting the specificity of the protease activity. Both, the substrate and the two nsP2 302 variants were stable when analyzed individually over 120 min (Fig. 5b) . 303
To assess the role of MARylation, the nsP2 protease domain was modified by ARTD10cat. This 305 prevented cleavage of the substrate, while ARTD10cat-GW had no effect (Fig. 5c ). Successful 306
MARylation of nsP2-459-798 is indicated by its mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5c ). The 307 inhibition of the protease function by ARTD10cat was dose dependent (Fig. 5d ). To interrogate 308 .

MARylation, which was evident in the presence of hydrolase either by the reduced mobility 311 shift or by staining with the MAR reagent, reactivated protease activity (Fig. 5e ). The 312 processing efficiency was quantified by measuring the intensity of unprocessed substrate and 313 the two fragments by immunoblotting and densitometric analysis. This documented that 314
MARylation by ARTD10cat efficiently repressed nsP2-459-798 protease activity, which was 315 antagonized by nsP3 or the isolated macrodomain (Fig. 5e,f) . Thus, these findings demonstrate 316 that the nsP2 protease domain is reversibly inhibited by MARylation and support our initial 317 hypothesis that MARylation inhibits polyprotein processing. We provide a mechanism how 318 MARylation antagonizes and consequently how the nsP3 macrodomain contributes to CHIKV 319 replication. 320 321 Discussion 322
Taken together, we established that ARTD10 and ARTD12 interfere with CHIKV RNA 323 replication and identified CHIKV nsP2 as target for MARylation by IFN-inducible mono-ARTDs. 324
Mechanistically, our results provide evidence for inhibition of the nsP2 protease function, 325 which is essential for viral replication, by ARTD10-dependent MARylation. This results in a 326 defect in CHIKV polyprotein processing and consequently in reduced replication. This 327
MARylation-dependent inhibition of the protease activity is antagonized by the macrodomain 328 of nsP3. Accordingly, the lack of MAR hydrolase activity prevents polyprotein processing. Thus, 329 our findings elucidate a mechanism for the importance of a functional macrodomain for CHIKV 330 replication. 331 332 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In this context the 333 best studied ARTD family member is ARTD13 (ZAP, Zinc-finger antiviral protein), which is able 334 to bind viral RNA, promoting its decay or interfering with its translation [53] . Further, ARTD13, 335 which is catalytically inactive, contributes to the establishment of an antiviral immune 336 response by crosstalk with the miRNA pathway, thereby stimulating expression of antiviral 337 proteins, and by amplifying RIG-I signaling [53] . Antiviral activities have also been assigned to 338 ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14. Overexpression of these ARTDs was shown to interfere with 339 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replication [7] . Additionally, ARTD12 was 340 described to restrict Sindbis Virus (SINV) and CHIKV replication amongst other RNA viruses [7] . 341
Further ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14 downregulate cellular translation in cells infected with 342 VEEV, which in the case of ARTD12 depends on catalytic activity [8] . ARTD12 has also been 343 identified to restrict Zika virus (ZIKV) replication, which is mediated by depletion of the ZIKV 344 non-structural proteins NS1 and NS3 [26] . Dependent on its catalytic activity, ARTD12 seems 345 to promote poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of these two viral proteins. PAR chains in turn 346 are argued to serve as scaffold to recruit E3 Ubiquitin-ligases that modify NS1 and NS3 by K48-347 linked polyubiquitination and thereby enable their proteasomal degradation [26] . Indeed, this 348 concept has already been established for PARylation mediated by ARTD5 and 6 (tankyrase 1 349 and 2, respectively) [1]. More than 70 substrates have been identified to be regulated through 350 PAR-mediated poly-ubiquitination [54] . The proposed mechanism is that ARTD12, as it is 351 limited to MARylation, modifies NS1 and NS3, which serves as a seeding event for polymer 352 forming ARTDs, possibly ARTD5 or 6 [26] . However, the effect of MARylation on CHIKV 353 replication seems to be different as demonstrated by experiments with inhibitors of 354 proteasomal and lysosomal pathways in this study (Fig. 3a,b) . In addition to the ZIKV proteins, 355 the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus (CoV) was recently suggested to be ADP-ribosylated 356 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

It will be interesting to identify the enzyme that catalyzes this 357 modification and moreover to define the molecular consequences, for example on capsid 358 formation. 359
In summary, these different reports suggest that ADP-ribosylation may interfere with multiple 361 viral functions. This is consistent with the observation that at least four of the 12 catalytically 362 active mono-ARTDs are induced by type I IFNs (Supplementary Fig. 1a) [1, 6, 11 ].

The artificial protease substrate (pGEX4T1-nsP3/nsP4-site-polylinker-EGFP) was created 474 based on the long nsP3/nsP4 site described in Rausalu et al. [51] . This sequence was ordered 475 as oligos containing EcoRI (5'-end) and BamHI (3'-end) restriction sites mimicking overhangs 476 (5'-aattcGACGAGTTAAGACTAGACAGGGCAGGTGGGTATATATTCTCGTCGgag-3', 3'-477 gatcctcCGACGAGAATATATACCCACCTGCCCTGTCTAGTCTTAACTCGTCg-5') that were annealed 478 in vitro.

This sequence was 500 inserted into GW-pEGFP-nsP3-macro or GW-pEGFP-nsP3-macro-V33E using the AgeI and XhoI 501 restriction sites and ligation, replacing the EGFP. 502 503 pEVRFO-HA and the pEGFP-ARTD10 constructs were described previously [14, 59] . pHA-, 504 pEGFP-C1-and pcDNA5/FRT/TO-C-TAP-ARTD12 were created from the pNIC-28-BsaI-ARTD12 505 (M1-Q701) plasmid that was obtained from O. Gileadi (Oxford) by gateway cloning. Constructs 506 for expression of eukaryotic fusion proteins of nsP2, nsP2-459-798, nsP3 and nsP3-macro 507 were cloned into pcDNA3-Flag, pHA, pEGFP-C1 or pcDNA5/FRT/TO-N-TAP with gateway 508 cloning using the SP6-CHIKV-replicon-SG-GLuc as a template. Mutants (except for replicon 509 mutants, see above) were generated using standard mutagenesis procedures (e.g. Q5 510 mutagenesis kit (NEB)) and confirmed by sequencing. pcDNA3-HA-ARTD1 was a kind gift from 511 M. Hottiger (Zürich) and pCMV-HA-ARTD14 from Andreas Ladurner (München). 512 513
For in vitro transcription of replicon RNA, DNA plasmids encoding the respective replicon 515 variants were first linearized with NdeI. Subsequently, linearized DNA was transcribed using 516 the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ SP6 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the 517 manufacturer's instructions. Cap-analog [m 7 G(5')ppp(5')G] and GTP were added to the 518 reactions to obtain 5'-capped RNA.

However, host shutoff is not indiscriminate, since viral proteins and host proteins 28 required for viral replication are still synthesized during shutoff. The molecular determinants of 29 target selectivity in host shutoff remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the 30 influenza A virus shutoff factor PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for 31 destruction. PA-X preferentially degrades spliced mRNAs, both transcriptome-wide and in 32 reporter assays. Moreover, proximity-labeling proteomics revealed that PA-X interacts with 33 cellular proteins involved in RNA splicing. The interaction with splicing contributes to target 34 discrimination and is unique among viral host shutoff nucleases. This novel mechanism sheds 35 light on the specificity of viral control of host gene expression and may provide opportunities for 36 development of new host-targeted antivirals. 37 38 39 All rights reserved.

We found that the RT-qPCR results 154 agreed with the RNAseq data in terms of the selective effects on the tested transcripts ( Figure  155 2C). Moreover, the mRNA levels were similarly affected by overexpression of PA-X from the 156 A/Udorn/72 H3N2 (Udorn) strain, suggesting that target selection by PA-X is conserved between 157 different virus strains ( Figure 2D ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that PA-X broadly 158 targets RNA for degradation, while a subset of RNAs remains unaffected. 159 160 Specific functional classes of host RNAs are differentially sensitive to PA-X 161
Although most RNAs were down-regulated by PA-X, the levels of ~25% of RNAs remained 162 largely unchanged ( Figures 1C, 2A) . To identify these differentially-regulated RNAs, we used k-163 means clustering to group RNAs with similar patterns of regulation (Gasch and Eisen, 2002) . 164
Clustering was carried out based on the relative RNA levels in PA-X-overexpressing vs. control 165 cells or IAV-infected vs. mock-infected cells in the eight datasets we collected ( Figures 1C, S1B , 166 2A). Two sets of RNAs, comprising 55% of the RNAs that were detected in all conditions, were 167 identified as true PA-X targets ( Figure 3A ). They were down-regulated in a PA-X-dependent 168 manner both during infection and by PA-X ectopic expression. The first group was completely 169 PA-X-specific, because their levels were largely unchanged in IAV PA(ΔX) infected cells 170 ( Figure 3A , left panel). The RNAs in the second group were PA-X-sensitive, but were partially 171 down-regulated by other mechanisms during IAV PA(ΔX) infection ( Figure 3A , right panel). By 172 contrast, 28% of the RNAs were host shutoff resistant and were not down-regulated by infection 173 or PA-X expression ( Figure 3B ). In addition, the k-means algorithm identified a group of RNAs 174 that were down-regulated during infection by a PA-X-independent mechanism, and yet were PA-175 X-sensitive in PA-X-expressing cells ( Figure 3C ).

Interestingly, based on gene ontology (GO) term analysis, the host shutoff-178 resistant RNAs were significantly enriched for genes involved in transcription and translation, 179 including ribosomal RNA processing, ribosomal proteins, and membrane protein synthesis 180 ( Figure 3D ). This result is consistent with the IAV requirement for host biosynthetic machinery IAV infection, as demonstrated by their higher expression compared to all detected RNAs, their 189 levels were even higher in the absence of PA-X ( Figure 3E ). While only 12% of ISGs were up-190 regulated during wt IAV infection, and only 4% were induced more than two-fold, 35% of the 191 ISGs were up-regulated in IAV PA(ΔX)-infected cells, with 15% above two-fold. While the 192 activity of PA-X is clearly not limited to ISGs, these data indicate that PA-X contributes to 193 dampening the cell-intrinsic response to infection. 194
We have previously shown that PA-X preferentially degrades RNA transcribed by Pol II 197 (Khaperskyy et al., 2016) . A key difference between transcripts of Pol II and other cellular Pols 198 is that Pol II RNAs can be spliced. The process of splicing is mechanistically linked to 199 IAV PA(ΔX) virus ( Figure S4A ), suggesting that PA-X down-regulates IFN-λ2 mRNA in 246 infected cells. We co-transfected the IFN-l2 expression vectors with PR8 PA-X and a luciferase 247 construct containing an intron (Younis et al., 2010), which served as a positive control for PA-X 248 activity. We confirmed that IFN-λ2 mRNA was expressed and exported into the cytoplasm at 249 similar levels irrespective of the construct used ( Figures S4B, S4C) . We also checked that the 250 five introns were properly spliced by PCR analysis across the splice sites ( Figures 5E, S4D) . 251
When we analyzed the effect of PA-X on the two mRNAs, we found that PA-X down-regulated 252 the IFN-λ2 mRNA expressed from the full genomic region ( Figure 5B ). However, the levels of 253 the same IFN-λ2 mRNA expressed from an intronless cDNA construct were only minimally 254 reduced ( Figure 5B ). In both conditions, the control luciferase reporter was down-regulated by 255 PA-X. PA-X proteins from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strains (such as A/California/7/09(H1N1) 256 (CA/7) and A/Tennessee/1-560/2009) and the Udorn H3N2 strain also preferentially degraded 257 intron-containing target RNAs ( Figure 5C ). These results confirm the prediction based on our 258
RNAseq data that splicing is important for PA-X substrate recognition. In addition, we tested the 259 down-regulation of IFN-λ2 mRNAs expressed from chimeric constructs that contained only one 260 of the five introns from the original genomic sequence, to determine whether one splicing event 261 was sufficient to restore PA-X targeting. Indeed, addition of single introns increased 262 susceptibility to PA-X ( Figure 5D ). Interestingly, not all introns were effective, in part because 263 of variable splicing efficiency. For example, intron 4 was not spliced efficiently in the absence of 264 other introns and also did not restore PA-X susceptibility ( Figure 5E ).

To resolve this issue, we compared the fate of matching Interestingly, PA-X had a more robust effect on the spliced mRNA, although it could also down-273 regulate intronless luciferase mRNA ( Figure 5F ). These results suggest that addition of a single 274 splicing event further promotes degradation by PA-X. Reporters are selected for their robust 275 expression, although they are somewhat different from endogenous cellular mRNAs. Therefore, 276 it is possible that even intronless reporters associate with cellular factors that are important for 277 PA-X targeting. Nevertheless, our findings recommend the use of intron-containing reporters for 278 future cell-based studies of PA-X. To identify cellular X-ORF-interacting proteins we used a proteomic technique called BioID, 287 which relies on non-specific proximity biotinylation of lysine residues by a modified E. coli 288 biotin ligase, BirA* (Roux et al., 2012). Because there are two major classes of PA-X isoforms 289 that differ in X-ORF length (Shi et al., 2012), we fused BirA* to X-ORFs representative of each 290 All rights reserved.

As negative 291 controls, we used BirA* alone and BirA* fused to a mutated version of the PR8 X-ORF in which 292 four positively charged residues were substituted by alanine (X61(4A)). These mutations prevent 293 nuclear localization of a GFP-X-ORF fusion and disrupt mRNA degradation by full length PA-X 294 (Khaperskyy et al., 2016). As expected from our previous studies with GFP fusion and epitope-295 tagged proteins (Khaperskyy et al., 2016), fusion to the wt X-ORFs, but not X61(4A), led to 296 accumulation of BirA* in the nucleus ( Figure S5A ). Moreover, BirA* alone and BirA*-X-ORF 297 fusion proteins efficiently biotinylated numerous cellular proteins ( Figure S5B ). 298
To identify cellular proteins that bind both the X61 and X41 X-ORFs, we collected protein 300 lysates from HEK293T cells expressing the BirA*-X-ORF fusion proteins. We prepared affinity-301 purified biotinylated proteins for quantitative mass spectrometry, using reductive dimethylation 302 to introduce stable epitope tags. We performed three independent replicates of the experiment, 303 two with BirA*-X61 and one with BirA*-X41, comparing them in each case to the BirA* alone 304 and BirA*-X61(4A) controls ( Figure 6A ). We identified 156 candidate X-ORF interacting 305 proteins that were represented by at least two unique peptides (Table S5) , and were identified in 306 all runs ( Figure 6B ). Among the 156 candidates, we identified 29 high-confidence interacting 307 proteins based on relative peptide abundance in the test conditions (BirA*-X61 or X41) vs. the 308 control conditions (BirA*-X61(4A) or BirA* alone) ( Figure 6D , Table S5 ). These high-309 confidence hits were enriched more than two-fold over controls in at least two experiments or 310 more than 1.5-fold in all three experiments. Figure 6C depicts the relative peptide abundance of 311 proteins in X61 samples compared to the X61(4A) control or BirA* alone control, with black 312 and red open circles identifying the high confidence hits.

Because nucleolin and nucleophosmin are abundant proteins that move in and out of 315 nucleoli, these interactions may explain the apparent nucleolar accumulation of biotinylated 316 proteins ( Figures S5A, S5C) . STRING protein-protein interaction network analysis of the hits 317 revealed several physical and functional interaction nodes, including protein trafficking, 318 transcription/translation and mRNA processing ( Figure 6D ). Similarly, GO term analysis 319 revealed a strong association with mRNA processing, RNA splicing and mRNA metabolic 320 process functions among the high-confidence hits ( Figure 6E ). In particular, several proteins 321 associated with mRNA splicing (RBM39, PUF60, PRPF4) and/or polyadenylation (NUDT21/ 322 CPSF5, CPSF6) were identified as X-ORF-interacting proteins. These data show that the PA-X 323 C-terminal X-ORF is physically recruited to protein complexes involved in nuclear mRNA 324 processing, which likely explains its preferential degradation of RNAs that have undergone 325 co/post-transcriptional processing. 326
A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanism of action of PA-X is required to 329 determine how it selectively degrades host RNAs and contributes to the control of the innate 330 immune response. In this study, we discovered a key aspect of the PA-X mechanism of action: 331 its selectivity for transcripts that have undergone splicing. Our transcriptomic results show that, 332 as expected, PA-X down-regulates many host RNAs, both on its own and in the context of 333 infection. However, some RNAs are less susceptible or completely resistant to PA-X activity. 334
This difference is due in part to the fact that they are either intronless or have fewer introns. 335

These data point to a model whereby PA-X 337 associates with RNA metabolism proteins, and this association brings PA-X to target RNAs, 338 perhaps during transcription or early processing. Those RNAs that are not canonically processed, 339 including viral RNAs, are thus not targeted. 340
Our results confirm that the PA-X-dependent down-regulation of host protein production 342 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/442996 doi: bioRxiv preprint
The key unexpected finding from our study is the link between PA-X and splicing. Viral host 360
shutoff RNases mostly act at some stage of mRNP loading into the translation apparatus. For 361 example, alpha-herpesvirus vhs directly interacts with translation initiation factors, and it is 362 generally believed that these interactions mediate RNA targeting (Doepker et with RNAs through interactions with Pol II, and thus only Pol II transcripts are normally spliced 372 (Gu et al., 2013) . We hypothesize that protein-protein interactions with splicing factors may 373 bring PA-X to its transcript, an idea which is corroborated by the results of our proteomic 374 analysis ( Figure 6 ). Indeed the C-terminal domain of PA-X interacts with several splicing 375 regulators (PUF60, RBM39, PRPF4) and polyadenylation proteins (CPSF5/NUDT21, CPSF6). 376
We speculate that more exons provide more chances for PA-X to be brought to the RNA by 377 some of these factors. In turn, this may translate into more effective turnover of RNAs with more 378 splice sites. 379 380 A targeting strategy based on splicing offers a major benefit to the virus, because viral mRNAs 381 are synthesized by the RdRp and most of them are not spliced.

However, they inserted the stop 406 codon after 16 aa, which was likely not sufficient to abolish PA-X activity ( Figure 1B ) (Jagger et 407 al., 2012) . The finding that truncating the X-ORF is sufficient to block PA-X activity in the virus 408 is also important, because single point mutations in the X-ORF sequence are less disruptive 409 changes than frameshifting mutations. Thus, viruses carrying X-ORF mutations could be better 410 tools for in vivo studies of PA-X function and IAV pathogenesis. rescue activity, suggesting that the X-ORF is needed for additional functions (Hayashi et al., 416 2016 ). Our BioID results corroborate this idea, since we did not only find proteins involved in 417 nuclear import, but identified many proteins with various roles in RNA metabolism. Also, by 418 examining the X-ORF in isolation, we likely excluded indirect interactions via RNA binding of 419 the RNase domain, as well as interactions that are important for PA rather than PA-X function. 420
Two proteins that we identified, nucleolin and nucleophosmin, were also reported in a proteomic 421 study of H5N1 PA-X interactors (Li et al., 2016), suggesting they interact with at least three 422 different PA-X variants. While nucleolin and nucleophosmin are highly abundant proteins, they 423 are unlikely to be artifacts because they were enriched in all the X-ORF samples relative to the 424 controls. The fact that biotinylated proteins accumulated in the nucleoli also supports the idea 425 that nucleolin and nucleophosmin, which traffic to nucleoli, come in contact with the BirA*-426 fused X-ORF and full length PA-X ( Figure S5C ). It is unclear whether the high biotinylation in 427 nucleoli is of functional importance, since PA-X itself is not localized specifically to this 428 All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. Interestingly, we did not isolate many core components of transcription or mRNA processing 433 machinery. PA-X appears to interact mostly with factors that are considered regulators of 434 alternative splicing (PUF60, RBM39, HNRNPK), or connect splicing with adenylation and 435 enhance poly(A) site choice (CPSF5/NUDT21, CPSF6). It will be interesting to determine how 436 these proteins are involved in PA-X activity. Particularly, since these proteins do not regulate the 437 processing of all mRNAs in the cell to the same extent, interactions with these proteins could 438 offer PA-X an additional mechanism for target discrimination. Another interesting question is 439 whether these associations compromise the normal activity of the cellular proteins. We did not 440 find dramatic changes in the host splicing pattern in our dataset (not shown), but we may have 441 missed some subtle changes. 442 443 It is interesting that both PA-X and the well known influenza host shutoff factor NS1 interact 444 with nuclear mRNA processing machinery to control gene expression (Nemeroff et al., 1998) . 445
The NS1 variants of many influenza A strains (but not PR8) cause host shutoff by binding and 446 inhibiting a key component of the 3'-end RNA processing machinery, CPSF30 (Das et al., 2008; 447 Nemeroff et al., 1998) . It is possible that this convergence could allow the two proteins to 448 coordinate an attack on the host. However, studies of engineered viruses and naturally-evolved 449 viruses suggest that the activity of NS1 and PA-X may be anti-correlated to prevent cytotoxicity. 450

It will be interesting in the future to observe how PA-X and NS1 interact in 460 viruses that, unlike PR8, use NS1 to block mRNA processing. 461 462 Collectively, our results affirm the importance of PA-X for the viral replication cycle, as they 463
show that the ability of the virus to regulate host gene expression is severely reduced in the 464 absence of PA-X. Moreover, we have uncovered a unique mechanism of host RNA targeting that 465 can allow PA-X to not only distinguish between host and viral targets, but also among cellular 466 targets. For example, the intronless mRNA TAF7, which we examined in Figures 2B, 2C , is a 467 component of Pol II pre-initiation complexes. Therefore, the selectivity of PA-X could have 468 repercussions for the viral replication cycle. By continuing to define the PA-X mechanism of 469 action, we will gain important insights into how host shutoff allows the virus to usurp host 470 biosynthetic machinery, and expand our knowledge of the link between PA-X and IAV 471 pathogenesis. 472 473 474 All rights reserved.

At present, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a newly recognized viruse, has spread rapidly throughout Wuhan (Hubei province) to other provinces in China and around the world, and has infected closed to 80,000 people in China and killed more than 2,000 untill Feb 26, 2020 because of no specific and effective drug.
In the course of sepsis, both innate and acquired immune systems are involved in its development, in which the mononuclear phagocyte system plays a crucial role. Although the timeline of immunological alterations in sepsis is not well understood, the suggestive evidence demonstrated that the development of sepsis involves two distinct stages, an initial cytokine storm (hyper-inflammation) and subsequent immunosuppression (hypo-inflammation), which exist concomitantly and dominate in different stage (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Hutchins, Unsinger, Hotchkiss & Ayala, 2014) . The uncontrolled cytokine storm is responsible for deaths occurring within the first few days, whereas immunosuppression predominantly causes mortality during the later stage of sepsis. In fact, more than 70% of patients die after the first three days of sepsis, which might due to the increased susceptibility to weakly virulent pathogens or opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), indicating a failure of the host to eradicate invading pathogens (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Skrupky, Kerby & Hotchkiss, 2011) . For patients in immunosuppression stage, only less than 5% of monocytes/macrophages produce cytokines, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 which might be related to the disordered immune response in sepsis (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Hutchins, Unsinger, Hotchkiss & Ayala, 2014) , demonstrating the impaired function of monocytes/macrophages is tightly related to the decrease of removing bacteria.
Considering the drugs based on the inhibition of critical pro-inflammatory mediators have failed, the therapeutic strategy to improve immunosuppression is the focus of sepsis treatment now (Cohen, 2002; Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Kox, Volk, Kox & Volk, 2000; Prucha, Zazula & Russwurm, 2017) .
Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process involved in defense against infection by intracellular pathogens (Casanova, 2017) . Although contradictory findings have been reported (Ho et al., 2016) , accumulating evidence suggest that autophagy plays a key role in sepsis, and has been considered a potential target for sepsis-induced immunosuppression (Ren, Zhang, Wu & Yao, 2017) . It is promising to focus on autophagy axis to unveil the mechanism of sepsis-induced immunosuppression and discover the novel immunoregulating therapies for sepsis. Artesunate (AS) is an effective and reliable anti-malarial drug with low toxicity (Burrows, Chibale & Wells, 2011; Clark, White, S, Gaunt, Winstanley & Ward, 2004) , which possesses several interesting effects such as anti-inflammation and other effects (Efferth, Dunstan, Sauerbrey, Miyachi & Chitambar, 2001; Li et al., 2008; Miranda et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017) . Previously, we showed that AS protects septic animals by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine release in cytokine storm stage (Li et al., 2008) , suggesting that AS could exhibit anti-inflammatory activity during the cytokine storm phase of sepsis.

BALB/c mice (sex: half male and half female; weight: 18 -22 g; age: 6 -8 weeks) were obtained from Beijing HFK Bioscience (Beijing, China) and housed in a pathogen-free facility with a 12-h artificial light-dark cycle in the Third Military Medical University. All the mice were provided with food and purified water ad libitum. There were no more than 5 mice in each cage. All animal care and experimental procedures were conducted were approved by Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University (AMUWEC2020015). Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guideline (Kilkenny, Browne, Cuthill, Emerson, Altman & Group, 2010) and with the recommendations made by the British Journal of Pharmacology.
The murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 cells and Human monocyte THP-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% low-LPS fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (regular medium) in a 37°C humid atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone) regular medium in suspension. THP-1 derived macrophages were obtained by differentiating THP-1 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) treatment at 100 nM for 24 h according to the previous study .

Each mouse was intraperitoneal injected with 3 mL of 3% thioglycolate (Sigma-Aldrich) on day 1 and sacrificed using isoflurane on Day 3. After intraperitoneal injection of 5 mL DMEM regular medium, the peritoneal cells were collected into cell culture dishes. Two hours later, the floating cells were removed by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The attached cells were considered to be PMs (purity is about 90%) and were subjected to further experiments. The primary mouse macrophages or cell lines were maintained in regular medium at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. All the reagents and utensils used in the experiment were LPS-free.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) clinical insolate was kindly provided by Prof. Peiyuan Xia (Southwestern Hospital, Chongqing, China). Single colony was picked from viable, growing Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plate. Then, it was transferred to 5 ml of liquid MH medium and cultivated aerobically at 37 ℃ in orbital shaking incubator for 4 h. The cultures were transferred to 100 ml of fresh MH medium for another 12 h. At an OD600 of 0.6 -0.8, when the bacterial culture was within the logarithmic phase of growth measured by SmartSpec 3000 spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), the suspension was centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min to harvest the pellet. After washing twice, the pellet was re-suspended by sterile normal saline. The bacteria were diluted in sterile normal saline to achieve the terminal concentration [(colony-formation units (CFU)/mL], which was calculated according to the bacterial growth curve determined by our lab (Concentration = (9.7544 × OD -1.4965) × 10 8 .

Currently, CLP in rodents is regarded as a gold standard in sepsis research (Rittirsch, Huber-Lang, Flierl & Ward, 2009) . CLP immunosuppression mice (CLP mice) with second bacterial infection model was established in our lab and described (Deng et al., 2017) . Briefly, CLP mice were established by ligating the distal 1.0 cm of the cecum and puncturing once with a No. 16 steel needle, and then were intravenously injected with PA (with 2.5 × 10 9 CFU/kg) at 24 h after CLP surgery ( Figure 1a ) .
National Medicine Standard H10930195) was added into the attached 5% sodium bicarbonate injection, shaking for 2 minutes until completely dissolved, then diluted in sterile normal saline to achieve the terminal concentration. AS (10 mg/kg) was intramuscularly injected at 22, 26, 48, and 72 h following the CLP surgery. The survival rate of the mice was observed for 7 days. CLP mice were sacrificed at 4 h after PA injection. The blood, lungs, and spleen tissues were collected for CFU count assays and ELISA.
LPS tolerance is extensively used to simulate the sepsis-induced immunosuppression phase in vitro (Li et al., 2013) . Herein, a cell model of LPS tolerance was established in mouse PMs) and RAW264.7 cells. Briefly, cells were cultured with LPS (0111: B4, Sigma-Aldrich, 5 .

Then the culture supernatant was replaced followed by the addition of LPS (100 ng/mL) to establish the LPS-tolerance cells model.
For AS treatment, AS (5, 10, and 20 µg/mL) was added with LPS (5 ng/mL) and LPS (100 ng/mL) simultaneously. For autophagy inhibitors treatment, 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 5 mM) (Sigma-Aldrich), bafilomycin A1(Baf, 10 ng/mL) (MedChemExpress, NJ, USA) and LY294002 (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 μM) was added 2 h before the first LPS (5 ng/mL), and also with AS treatment simultaneously. The supernatants and cells were collected at 6 h after the last LPS (100 ng/mL) addition.

The shRNA targeting mouse VDR (5′-CCTCAAACTCTGATCTGTA-3′), NF-κB p65 (5′-CCCTCAGCACCATCAACTTTG-3′) and the negative control shRNA (5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′) were designed, synthesized and inserted into the lentivirus vector (#GV248, GeneChem) by the GeneChem Corporation (Shanghai, China).
The resulting recombinant lentivirus was named VDR-KD, NF-κB p65-KD and NC-KD.
For lentivirus transfection, RAW264.7 cells were cultured to 50% confluence and transfected with the lentivirus according to the protocol in the Lentivirus Operation Manual for 6 h. After three days of renewed culture in regular DMEM, the cells were subjected to further treatment.
The lentivirus VDR-KD and NC-KD was diluted to a total volume of 200 μl containing 4 × 10 7 TU. BALB/c mice were transfected through tail intravenous injection as reported (Morizono et al., 2005) . One week later, mice were sacrificed and spleen tissues were collect to detect the infection efficiency. Further CLP modeling and AS treatment were employed in transfected mice, and their tissues were collected for the cytokines and western bolting assays.
Interacting molecular prediction for AS was performed against 5,311 proteins using the weighted ensemble similarity (WES) algorithm (Zheng et al., 2015) assembled in the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP)

WES was developed to determine a drug's affiliation for a target by evaluation of the overall similarity (ensemble) rather than a single ligand judgment, which allowed us to discovery scaffold hopping ligands. The ligand structural and physicochemical features of AS were calculated using Chemical Development Kit (CDK) (Steinbeck, Han, Kuhn, Horlacher, Luttmann & Willighagen, 2003) and Dragon software and then used to evaluate the ensemble similarity between AS and ligands of candidate targets. Finally, the standardized ensemble similarities of CDK and Dragon were integrated using a Bayesian network to rank the predicted targets.
RAW264.7 cells were treated as indicated above and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4℃ overnight and post fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h at room temperature. After fixation, cells were embedded and stained with uranyl acetate/lead citrate. The sections were examined under a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1400PLUS, Japan) at 60 kV.

RAW264.7 cells (5 × 10 4 cells/well) were plated in 96-well plates in regular medium. After overnight culturing, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with a series concentration of LPS or certain treatment for 4 or 24 h. Subsequently, 20 μl of the MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to the medium in a total volume of 200 μl. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . Then, the supernatant was removed, and 150 μl of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the produced formazan crystals. The extinction was measured at 490 nm using SmartSpec 3000 spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
For the mouse tissue samples, at the indicated time points after PA injection, the blood, lungs, and spleen were collected. Blood or homogenates of cells, lungs and spleen tissues were serially diluted. Subsequently, 100 μL of the diluents was added to nutrient agar plates and cultured for 18 h. Images of the agar plates and CFU counts were obtained using a G6 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.966143 doi: bioRxiv preprint rpm for 5 min. The precipitation was resuspended by MH medium and serially diluted.
Microlon ELISA Plates were coated with antibody against VDR (anti-VDR antibody) (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA) overnight at 4 C, followed by three washes with PBS. The cell lysate containing the total proteins, including the VDR protein, were added into the plates. After incubating at 37 C for 2 h, the VDR protein was captured by anti-VDR antibody coated on the plates. Subsequently, the plates were washed three times and V D3 (Selleck, Houston, TX, USA) was added. After incubating at 37 C for 2 h, the plates were washed three times and fluorophore-conjugated AS (designed and synthesized by Chongqing Canbipharma Technology, Chongqing, China) was added. After incubating at 37 C for 2 h, the plates were washed three times and the fluorescence intensity was observed using a Spectra Max i3x Multifunctional enzyme marker (Molecular Devices, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm. AS with fluorophore 12-(7-oxycoumarinyl-ethoxy) dihydro-artemisinin was named AS I, and AS with 12-(-1H-benzo [de] isoquinoline-1, 3(2H)-dione-2-ethoxy) dihydro-artemisinin was named AS II.

The results from CLP mice showed that AS treatment decreased the mortality of CLP mice challenged with PA from 85% to 50% (Figure 1b) , suggesting that AS could protect CLP-induced immunosuppression in mice. In CLP mice unchallenged with PA, the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were extremely low in the serum, spleen, and lungs. However, their levels increased significantly in AS-treated CLP mice (Figure 1c) . Furthermore, the cytokines levels in CLP mice challenged with PA were also much lower in contrast with sham mice challenged with PA, demonstrating that bacterial challenge could not induce pro-inflammatory cytokines release in sepsis-induced immunosuppressed mice. Importantly, AS treatment significantly augmented the cytokine levels (Figure 1d ), indicating that AS could increase cytokine levels in sepsis-induced immunosuppressed mice. Subsequently, the results showed that the bacterial loads obviously increased in the tissues of CLP mice challenged with PA compared with those in the sham mice, demonstrating that the CLP mice had a lower bacterial clearance ability. However, AS significantly decreased the bacterial load ( Figure 1e) , suggesting AS could protect sepsis-induced immunosuppression by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine release and decreasing the bacterial load.
Based on the concentration-effect relationship between LPS and cytokine production ( Figure   . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.966143 doi: bioRxiv preprint 24 2a), 5 ng/mL LPS of four-hour incubation followed by 100 ng/mL LPS was determined to induce LPS tolerance phenotype (tolerance cells) (Figure 2b ). Compared with cells treated with only 100 ng/mL LPS treatment (LPS cells), tolerance cells pretreated with 5 ng/mL LPS and followed by 100 ng/mL LPS released much less TNF-α and IL-6 ( Figure 2c ). However, AS exhibited a dose-dependent enhancement of TNF-α and IL-6 release in tolerance cells ( Figure 2d) . The results showed the bacterial loads in LPS tolerance cells increased relative to LPS cells at 2 h after PA challenge. Significantly, AS decreased the bacteria load in tolerance cells ( Figure 2e ). Noteworthily, since the concentrations of LPS (2.5 -200 ng/mL) and AS(0.625 -40 μg/ml) used in the experiment had no effect on cell viability, the above effect was not related to the toxicity of LPS and AS on cell activity ( Figure S1a ) (Li et al., 2008) . Subsequent, the human monocyte cell line THP-1 and THP-1 derived macrophages were employed to confirm whether there is a similar effect in human cells. The identical results in the mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and bacterial clearance in THP-1 cells and THP-1 derived macrophages were obtained (Figure 2f, g) . These results were consistent with the findings in vivo, demonstrating that AS might reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression through enhancing pro-inflammatory cytokines release and bacterial clearance by macrophages.
To further investigate the molecular mechanism of AS, interacted candidates of AS were predicted. Firstly, the top 20 candidates (Figure 3a) were preliminarily screened using RT-PCR. Among them, the most significant and stable change was observed in the mRNA . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.966143 doi: bioRxiv preprint and protein level of VDR, which remarkably increased in tolerance cells and decreased by AS (Figure 3b, c) .
Secondly, VDR expression in RAW264.7 was modified. A VDR siRNA and a lentiviral vector harboring an RNAi sequence against VDR were transfected into RAW264.7 cells to knock down VDR expression (VDR-KD cells) ( Figure S2a) . The results showed that knock-down of VDR would lead to a loss of LPS tolerance phenotype, and addition of AS making no difference (Figure 3d) . A lentiviral vector harboring the VDR gene was transfected into RAW264.7 cells to overexpress the VDR (VDR-OE cells) ( Figure S2b ). The results showed that AS-promoting TNF-α level in LPS tolerance cells was abrogated by overexpressing VDR (Figure 3e ). These findings indicated VDR might be an essential and key molecule in LPS tolerance formation and could be further considered as an interacted candidate of AS.
Thirdly, to further verify the interaction between AS and VDR, an indirect competitive binding assay using AS labeled with fluorophore was carried out (Figure 3f1) . The results showed pre-incubation of V D3 decreased the AS-related fluorescence intensity significantly ( Figure 3f2 ), suggesting that V D3 firstly occupied the receptor and then decreased the interaction between AS and VDR.
Lastly, based on V D3 is a natural agonist of VDR and there are a very high affinity between them (Haussler, Jurutka, Mizwicki & Norman, 2011) , the effect of AS on TNF-α level was investigated in presence and in absence of V D3 to validate the above findings. The results showed, in the absence of V D3 , TNF-α level decreased and AS-promoting TNF-α release in LPS tolerance cells. However, when pro-incubated with V D3 , the effect that .

These results strongly indicate that AS may bind to the same receptor or even similar sites as V D3 .
Taken together, all the aforementioned findings demonstrated that AS might interacted with VDR, subsequently inhibiting its biological function of VDR. Therefore, we considered that AS might interact with VDR as an antagonist and then reversed LPS tolerance state.
VDR is a nuclear receptor that mediates most biological functions of V D3 ; it can translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of downstream target genes such as ATG16L1 via binding to their promotors , and then regulating the V D3 -mediated regulation of autophagy and antibacterial effects (Sun, 2016) . Therefore, nuclear translocation of VDR and its subsequent effect on target gene ATG16L1 was investigated firstly. The immunoblotting and immunostaining results showed that VDR protein level dramatically increased in the nucleus of LPS tolerance cells compared with LPS cells, which could be reversed by AS (Figure 4a, b) . Secondly, a ChIP assay results showed that AS induced binding of VDR to the promoter of ATG16L1 as analyzed by semiquantitative PCR and RT-PCR in LPS tolerance cells (Figure 4c, d) . Together, these data showed that AS's effect is closely related to the transcriptional regulation of VDR on ATG16L1. Thirdly, the immunoblotting results indicated that the protein level of ATG16L1 in LPS tolerance cells obviously decreased compared with LPS cells, but AS increased its .

Additionally, our results demonstrated that the protein level of ATG16L1 in LPS tolerance cells markedly increased in VDR-KD group compared with Ctrl-KD group, and the effect of AS was diminished (Figure 4f ). However, AS-increasing ATG16L1 level in LPS tolerance cells was abrogated by overexpression of VDR ( Figure 4g ). All the aforementioned findings indicated AS inhibits the function of VDR via preventing the nuclear translocation of VDR, thus influences the transcription of its target genes ATG16L1.
Autophagy is an important self-protection mechanism required for bacterial clearance and inflammation (Gutierrez, Master, Singh, Taylor, Colombo & Deretic, 2004; Levine, Mizushima & Virgin, 2011) . ATG16L1, the target gene of VDR and a regulator for autophagy, links VDR and autophagy (Wu & Sun, 2011) . Firstly, to confirm the function of ATG16L1, cells were treated with ATG16L1 siRNA ( Figure S3a ). The results showed that TNF-α and IL-6 levels in LPS cells decreased and AS promoting TNF-α and IL-6 levels in LPS tolerance cells were eliminated in ATG16L1 siRNA infected group relative to negative control (Figure 5a, S2a) . It suggests that ATG16L1 is associated with inflammatory cytokine release in LPS tolerance cells and AS's effects.
Secondly, three autophagy inhibitors: 3-methyladenine (3-MA) targeting Vps34; bafilomycin A1 (Baf) blocking autophagosome and lysosome fusion; and LY294002 targeting Vps34 (also known as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3) were .

The results showed that TNF-α and IL-6 levels in LPS cells decreased and AS-promoting TNF-α and IL-6 levels in LPS tolerance cells were significantly eliminated when pro-incubated with Baf ( Figure 5b ) and 3-MA (Figure 5c) . Furthermore, our results demonstrated that AS markedly declined the bacteria loads in LPS tolerance cells challenged with PA and this effect could be abrogated when pro-incubated with 3-MA, LY294002 or Baf (Figure 5d) . These results indicated a potential correlation between autophagy and AS's effect.
The above results showed that autophagy contributes to AS's effect. Thirdly, the influence of AS on autophagy-related molecules was further investigated herein. The markers such as the conversion of microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3B-I) (18 kDa) to LC3B-II (16 kDa) and the accumulation of ATG5 were selected to evaluated autophagy activity (Schaaf, Keulers, Vooijs & Rouschop, 2016) . The results showed that LPS treatment increased LC3B-II and ATG5 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5e1) , consistent with the results that LPS induced pro-inflammatory cytokines release in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2a ). This further indicated that LPS-induced cytokine release is autophagy involved.
Immunoblotting showed that accumulation LC3B-II and ATG5 levels changed with time in LPS tolerance cells and peaked at 1 h ( Figure 5e2) . Therefore, 1 h was selected as the best time point to observe LPS-induced autophagic activities.
Fourthly, immunofluorescence staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
immunoblotting results revealed that autophagy activities remarkably decreased in LPS tolerance cells relative to LPS cells, which could be reversed by AS treatment (Figure S3b, 5f and 5g) at 1 h after the last LPS treatment. These results indicated that autophagy decline is . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Lastly, in LPS tolerance cells, LC3B-II and ATG5 level markedly increased when knocking down VDR compared with negative control, and addition of AS making no difference (Figure 5h ). AS-promoting LC3B-II and ATG5 level in LPS tolerance cells was abrogated by overexpressing VDR (Figure 5i ). All the aforementioned findings indicated that AS's effect is autophagy-dependent through VDR in vitro.
NF-κB is an important nuclear transcription factor, and regulates many pro-inflammatory cytokines transcription, both TNF-α and IL-6, are its target genes (Bonizzi & Karin, 2004) .
VDR physically interacts with NF-κB p65 in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and intestinal cells (Sun et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2010) , but it remains unclear that the functional relevance of this VDR/NF-κB p65 interaction in LPS tolerance macrophages. Herein, co-IP and fluorescent co-localization experiments were performed. The results showed that the associated NF-κB p65 level in cytoplasm protein had no significant change in the medium cells, LPS cells and LPS tolerance cells when an equal amount of VDR was used as a control (pull-down by VDR), but significantly decreased by AS treatment (Figure 6a1 ). However, AS had no effect on the nucleus protein of the associated NF-κB p65 in each treatment when an equal amount of VDR was used as a control (pull-down by VDR) (Figure 6a2 ). These results suggested that AS might bind VDR to interrupt the interaction between VDR and NF-κB p65 in cytoplasm, further implied that AS might affect the activity of NF-κB p65.

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 Subsequently, immunostaining was used to determine whether AS affected their intracellular co-localization and distribution of VDR and NF-κB p65. The results revealed an obvious co-localization of VDR and NF-κB p65 in LPS tolerance cells, but AS significantly inhibited their co-localization (Figure 6b1, b2) . Moreover, nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 markedly declined in LPS tolerance cells relative to LPS cells, which was reversed by AS treatment (Figure 61, b3) . These results indicated that high level of VDR intensively interacted with NF-κB p65, preventing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Noteworthily, AS inhibited the physical interaction between VDR and NF-κB p65, accelerating the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. To confirm it, the nuclear protein level of NF-κB p65 was investigated using ELISA and immunoblotting. The results showed NF-κB p65 level in nucleus obviously reduced in LPS tolerance cells relative to LPS cells, which was reversed by AS (Figure 6c1, c2) . In LPS tolerance cells, the nuclear NF-κB p65 level increased in VDR-KD group compared with negative control, leading to the loss of tolerance phenotype ( Figure 6d1 ). In VDR-OE cells, the NF-κB p65 nucleoprotein level remarkably suppressed compared to negative control, and AS treatment made no difference in LPS tolerance cells ( Figure 6d2 ). To determine whether AS-promoting pro-inflammatory cytokines releases in LPS tolerance cells is related to its influence on NF-κB p65 activity, NF-κB p65 expression in RAW264.7 was modified ( Figure S4a, b) . The results showed that knock-down of NF-κB p65 would lead to the decline in pro-inflammatory cytokines release, and loss of AS's effect ( Figure 6e1) . Simultaneously, overexpression of NF-κB p65 would lead to loss of LPS tolerance phenotype, and addition of AS making no difference (Figure 6e2 ). All the aforementioned findings indicated AS inhibited physically interacts between VDR and . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

To correlate the aforementioned findings from in vitro experiments, the mRNA and protein levels of VDR were measured in CLP mice. The results showed that the levels of VDR mRNA and protein expression significantly increased in PMs of CLP mice, but were markedly inhibited by AS (Figure 7a) , which was consistent with in vitro results. In VDR-KD CLP mice which VDR expression was knocked down using a lentiviral vector harboring a VDR RNAi sequence (VDR-KD) ( Figure S5a, b) , the level of TNF-α in spleen and lungs was significantly increased compare with negative control, and AS administration made no difference (Figure 7b ). It suggested that VDR overexpression is involved in sepsis-induced immunosuppression formulation, and knocking down of VDR would lead to loss of immunosuppressing phenotype. Additionally, immunoblotting results showed that autophagy-associated proteins in the spleen of CLP mice were increased compare with negative control, and AS made no difference (Figure 7c ). Taken together, both the in vivo and in vitro results indicate that the VDR plays an important role in sepsis-induced immunosuppression and AS's effect.

Herein, our results demonstrated that AS interacted with VDR to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in an autophagy and NF-κB dependent way. Together with our previous results (Kuang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2008) , AS is discovered to not only inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine release during hyper-inflammation stage but also enhance pro-inflammatory cytokines release and bacterial clearance by macrophages to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating that AS exhibits an immunoregulating effect for sepsis treatment, which is not reported previously.
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (Singer et al., 2016) . In the last decade, reversing sepsis-induced immunosuppression becomes the focus of sepsis research instead of targeting cytokine storm (Cohen, 2002; Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Kox, Volk, Kox & Volk, 2000; Prucha, Zazula & Russwurm, 2017) . However, drugs in current clinical trials, such as IL-7, anti-programmed cell death receptor-1 (anti-PD-1) and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, probably only for the immunosuppression stage of sepsis (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Prucha, Zazula & Russwurm, 2017) , and its clinical efficacy is yet to be proven.
Clinical investigations have consistently shown a close correlation between Vitamin D deficiency in serum and excess mortality and morbidity, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is tightly related to sepsis (Dickerson et al., 2016) . There are conflicting results from various studies on whether Vitamin D supplementation improves the outcome of patients with sepsis (Kearns, Alvarez, Seidel & Tangpricha, 2015; Putzu et al., 2017) . Clinical investigation on the outcome of sepsis patients accepted with Vitamin D supplementation is required in the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 future. Considering the extensive biological effects of Vitamin D, as well as its role in maintenance of homeostasis in organisms, it is necessary to maintain the physiological concentration of Vitamin D. Based on our results, we consider that low level of Vitamin D might lead to the insufficiency of anti-inflammation response in human body, but excessive Vitamin D might induce the high level of VDR expression; however, the excessive overexpression of VDR might lead to a decreased immune function. Thus, Vitamin D supplementation is necessary in the diet but excessive intake of Vitamin D might be no benefit. Therefore, we consider that an ideal immunotherapy for sepsis is not only to exert an anti-inflammatory effect during the cytokine storm stage, but also increase the resistance to infection during the immunosuppression stage. The therapeutic effects of AS on cytokine storm stage of sepsis and its mechanism has been proved in our previous studies (Kuang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2010; Li et al., 2008) . Herein, we revealed that AS possessed therapeutic effects in sepsis-induced immunosuppression in vivo and in vitro, too.
VDR belongs to a nuclear family receptor. Active VDR binds preferentially as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to hexameric repeats on vitamin D response elements (VDRE) in the promoter regions of target genes (Haussler et al., 1998; Orlov, Rochel, Moras & Klaholz, 2012) . As with other nuclear receptors, the nuclear translocation of RXR/VDR heterodimer functions to recruit additional cofactors that play an essential role in transcription (Haussler et al., 1998) . Herein, VDR was firstly predicted to be an interacted molecule candidate of AS by TCMSP, and then identified using PCR and WB. Moreover, we found that VDR was highly expressed and the nuclear translocation of VDR strikingly increased in LPS tolerance cells (mimic immunosuppression stage of sepsis) compared with .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 LPS cells (mimic cytokines storm stage), while AS treatment could markedly inhibit the high expression and the nuclear translocation of VDR. Furthermore, the interaction between AS and VDR was confirmed in the binding assay established in our lab. These results demonstrated that AS might interact with VDR to affect its activation, leading to a decline of VDR nuclear translocation. Thus, the effects of AS were investigated in presence and in absence of V D3 , which is the natural ligand of VDR. Our results showed AS's effect was eliminated when pro-incubated with V D3 , indicating that there is antagonism between V D3 and AS. These results strikingly suggest that AS might bind to the same receptor or even similar sites as V D3 .
Although the anti-inflammation or immunosuppressive effect of V D3 is reported to be tightly related to the function of VDR (Alroy, Towers & Freedman, 1995; Joshi et al., 2011; Lemire, Adams, Kermani-Arab, Bakke, Sakai & Jordan, 1985) , few studies have directly addressed the role of VDR in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Based on our results, we speculated that the excessive high level of VDR during the immunosuppression stage of sepsis might be related to the decreased inflammatory response. While AS could increase the survival rate of sepsis animals via its inhibition on high expression of VDR.
Autophagy is a fundamental cellular process involved in defensive against infection by eliminating intracellular pathogens and regulating inflammation (Casanova, 2017) , and autophagy has been considered a new target in sepsis treatment (Ren, Zhang, Wu & Yao, 2017) . Herein, combined with our previous study (Kuang et al., 2018) , we considered that autophagy was enhanced in the early sepsis stage (cytokine storm stage), but suppressed in the later sepsis stage (immunosuppression stage). Our results also showed AS could enhance . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

VDR was reported to be involved in immunoregulation and resistance to infections via regulating autophagy (Baeke, Takiishi, Korf, Gysemans & Mathieu, 2010; Gois, Ferreira, Olenski & Seguro, 2017) . VDR transcriptionally regulates ATG16L1, which is a target gene and an important autophagy-related protein molecule. If VDR is reduced, ATG16L1 is also reduced associated with abnormal Paneth cells for development of chronic states of mucosal inflammation (Sun, 2016) . However, our findings showed that high binding between VDR and ATG16L1 promotor lead to a low protein level of ATG16L1 in LPS tolerance cells, demonstrating VDR negatively regulated the transcription of ATG16L1 in LPS tolerance cells.
Based on that our results showed AS could inhibit VDR expression to up-regulate the transcription of ATG16L1 and increase autophagy activity, we considered that the discrepancy for the transcriptional regulation between VDR and ATG16L1 might be due to the differences in the inflammation and immune status. However, the mechanism needs further investigation in the future.
NF-κB is a vital transcription factor, and the NF-κB signaling pathway links pathogenic signals and cellular danger signals, thus organizing cellular resistance to invading pathogens, which is a network hub responsible for complex biological signaling (Albensi & Mattson, 2000; Kaltschmidt & Kaltschmidt, 2009 ). NF-κB p65 was reported to physically interact with VDR in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and intestinal cells (Sun et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2010) . Our previous studies have shown that AS could significantly inhibit LPS-induced . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Herein, we focused on its function in sepsis immunosuppression stage, and discovered that NF-κB p65 was negatively regulated by VDR due to the physical interaction between them in macrophages. Importantly, AS prevented the interaction between VDR and NF-κB p65 in LPS-tolerance cells, leading to a marked increase in nuclear NF-κB p65 translocation and expressions of downstream target genes such as TNF-α and IL-6. Furthermore, we found that AS decreased the binding between VDR and the promoter region of ATG16L1, leading to a decline in nuclear translocation of VDR and decreasing the negative transcription of ATG16L1, and lastly AS enhanced autophagy activities through binding VDR. Furthermore, knocking down VDR expression reversed the autophagy related proteins levels in immunosuppression stage, and over expressing VDR resulting in a failure of AS-promoting the autophagy related proteins levels. Thus, we concluded that AS interacted with VDR to reverse immunosuppression stage was autophagy involved. Taken together, we think AS interacted with VDR thereby inhibited the nuclear translocation of VDR and also inhibited physical interaction between VDR and NF-κB p65 in LPS tolerance macrophages, then promoted nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, enhancing autophagy and activating the transcription of NF-κB p65 target genes such as pro-inflammatory cytokines.
As we know, VDR is the receptor to recognize and bind V D3 . Will V D3 control VDR to achieve anti-sepsis effect? Although clinical investigation have shown a close correlation between Vitamin D deficiency in serum and excess morbidity and mortality of sepsis, suggesting vitamin D deficiency is closely related to sepsis (Dickerson et al., 2016) , it .

Considering the extensive biological effects of Vitamin D, as well as its role in maintenance of homeostasis in organisms, it is necessary and important to maintain the physiological concentration of Vitamin D. Noteworthy, excessive vitamin D supplementation may be harmful rather than beneficial based on our results that excessive Vitamin D might induce the high level of VDR expression, which might lead to decreased immune function.
Till now, the outcome of therapeutic regime only aiming at a single stage of sepsis is disappointing and even worse. It might due to that the treatment time window is important for the therapeutic regimen of sepsis, but difficult to grasp. Giving anti-inflammatory drugs in hypo-inflammatory stage or pro-inflammatory therapy in hyper-inflammatory stage lead to failures even increasing mortalities in clinic (Hotchkiss, Monneret & Payen, 2013a; Rudick, Cornell & Agrawal, 2017) . Therefore, we considered that an immunoregulator might be an ideal drug for sepsis without limitation of treatment time window. Our results demonstrated that AS might be an immunoregulator for both hyper-and hypo-inflammatory stage of sepsis based on previous and current results.
Mechanically, AS exerts its ""pro-inflammatory"" effect in immunosuppression stage in contrast to its ""anti-inflammatory"" effect in cytokines storm stage. Our present results outline the mechanism of AS's effect through two ways (presented in Figure 8 ): AS interacted with VDR to prevent the nuclear translocation of VDR and then decreases its negative regulation of autophagy related target genes such as ATG16L1, and then increases autophagy activity.
Additionally, AS interacted with VDR to prevent the interaction between VDR and NF-κB . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Above two ways lead to an increase in the bacteria clearance and the pro-inflammatory cytokine releases of macrophages.
Although monocytes/macrophages system plays a vital role in sepsis, the acquired immune system is equally important, and the effect of AS on T and B cells function remains to be investigated in the future. However, given the therapeutic effect of AS on CLP animal models, we firmly believe that AS will improve the function of T and B cells. VDR is an interaction molecule of AS, whether VDR is a drug target of AS remains to be further studied in the future. Overall, our findings provide an evidence that AS interacted with VDR to reverse sepsis-induced immunosuppression in an autophagy and NF-κB dependent way, highlighting a novel approach for sepsis treatment and drug repurposing of AS in the future.

Several 34 bioaerosol samplers and analytical methods have been used; however, the detection and 35 quantification of influenza virus among aerosol samples remains challenging. Therefore, 36 improved viral aerosol measurement methods are needed. This study evaluated influenza virus 37 recovery among three filter types polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride and polystyrene. 38 Polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride are fabricated filter materials and commonly used in 39 the scientific literature to sample for viral aerosols. A novel, electrospun polystyrene filter 40 material may improve viral aerosol recovery during filter-based air sampling. The filter materials 41 were compared across the following conditions: treated with or without air, filter wash buffer 42 (HBSS or PBS), and viral RNA extraction method (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or Trizol). 43 Twenty trials were completed in a chamber and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Viral 44 recovery was significantly different (p-value < .0001) by filter type. Polystyrene filter use 45 resulted in recovery of the most viral RNA. Air sampling did not affect the recovery of viral 46 RNA from the filter materials (p-values > 0.05). Viral RNA concentrations were significantly 47 different across extraction methods for all comparisons (p-values < 0.05). Our results 48 demonstrated that the novel polystyrene filter material resulted in the highest concentration of 49 extracted RNA compared to the commonly used polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride, 50 which we speculate may be related to the chemical composition of the filter material (e.g., 51 polystyrene is an aromatic hydrocarbon whereas polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride 52 contain more polar, and thus potentially reactive, carbon-halogen bonds).

The SKC Biosampler has been 78 found to have greater viral recovery compared to other commonly used filter-based samplers; 79 however, the differences across samplers were not statistically significant. [13] [14] [15] 80 81 Filters are used frequently as a sampling media in personal samplers in the field of exposure 82 assessment. Filter based samplers have also been used in the collection of aerosolized viruses due 83 to their efficiency in collecting sub-micrometer particles 10, 16 , and ability to be used for longer 84 periods in the field compared to impinger based methods. 17,18 Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), 85 polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate, and gelatin-containing filters have all been used to 86 collect virus 10,19 , with PTFE and PVC being the most efficient among filter materials tested. 16, 19 87 Nevertheless, the viral recovery from PTFE and PVC filter materials remains inefficient. 10
There are many other materials that can be used to fabricate filters for collection of bioaerosols. 90 For example, a new filter material made from polystyrene (PS) has been developed to be used in 91 the collection of bioaerosols. PS filters have been fabricated from electrospun fibers, yielding 92 materials with large surface areas and small pore sizes that make them very efficient in filtering 93 applications. 20 The hydrophobicity of the PS filter material may assist the viral capsid attachment 94 proteins and other biomolecules to adsorb to the fiber surfaces. 21 Furthermore, the use of PS as a 95 centrifuge tube material is common in the field of molecular biology, therefore it is hypothesized 96 that PS will perform well as a filter material for sampling aerosolized virus in the field of 97 exposure science.

0ab795fc615df6457551a8e231dce1f268eef9d2,"With the emergence of 4 rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 has entered a new period.
We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19.
Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19
were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness.
. Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23.
Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24).
Conclusions. The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.","Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of large-scale pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. 1-2 RT-PCR analyses and electron microscope observations detected a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as 2019-nCoV). 3 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, has been confirmed to have obvious person-to-person transmission among close contacts. [4] [5] As of February 25, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases and a total of 2700 deaths have been identified globally. 6 As the epidemic spreads to many countries, COVID-19 poses a severe threat to global health. In the early stage of the epidemic, the most common clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the onset of illness manifested as fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue, with or without sputum production and diarrhea. 7 Therefore, detecting and confirming infected cases in a timely manner and applying scientific treatment as soon as possible is extremely essential to reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Since the emergence of 3 th and even 4 rd -generation transmission 4 and signs of asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19, 8 the prevention and control of COVID-19 has entered a new period. Consequently, it is urgent to carefully observe the changes in patients' initial symptoms. As the designated hospital for patients with severe infection, we have been receiving COVID-19 patients in the newly opened unit since January 16. After the government announced a state of emergency and closed access to Wuhan city on January 23, the number of suspected patients who came to our unit increased rapidly. As of January 29, we received 89 patients confirmed with COVID-19. Surprisingly, during the consultation, we found that the clinical characteristics of patients admitted after January 23 began to differ from those of patients admitted before, which brings new challenges for the diagnosis of suspected patients. To prevent and control the epidemic scientifically, this study aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 patients from the perspective of clinical doctors and to compare the initial clinical features between patients infected in different periods.

The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China). All research procedures adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The design of the study was analytical, observational and retrospective. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (2nd edition) of China and was indicated by suspected symptoms, chest CT results and SARS-CoV-2 positivity by use of quantitative RT-PCR. We reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, and laboratory findings for 89 patients admitted from January 16, 2020, to January 29, 2020, who had confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19. Patients were assigned into two groups according to their admission date to analyze the differences in patients' features at admission over time.
The epidemiological data and clinical symptoms of the patients were collected by revising the clinical status (routine blood, CRP, SAA and CD3, CD4, CD8 cells) on the first day of admission from the medical records. Due to incomplete tests for some patients, some types of laboratory results are missing. Three researchers reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data independently.
Categorical variables are described with frequencies and percentages. Quantitative variables are described with the mean (SD) or, if they were not normally distributed, the median. Comparisons of quantitative variables between groups were performed using the independent-sample t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers (%) and compared by χ² test or Fisher's exact test between the first group and the second group. A two-sided p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 21.0.
By January 29, 2020, 89 patients were identified as having COVID-19 and admitted to our hospital. As shown in Table 1 , patients were assigned into two groups according to .

Thirty-one [34.8%] of the infected patients were admitted to the hospital from January 16 to 22 (before Jan. 23, first group), and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29 (after Jan. 23, second group). There was no significant difference in age distribution between the two groups of patients ( Table 1) Table 1 ). The result in the second group is not similar to that from previous studies. 7, 9 We speculate that this may be related to the small sample size, since there is no evidence that women are more vulnerable to infection as the COVID-19 spreads.
In terms of the initial symptoms, more symptoms appeared in patients from the first group ( did not show obvious differences between the two groups, suggesting that patients admitted earlier may have had more severe infection and immune disorders (Table 3 ).
We report here the admission characteristics of 89 patients with confirmed COVID-19.
All patients were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan from January 16 to January 29, 2020. As is known, patients and health-care workers can make a preliminary diagnosis of infectious diseases by accurately grasping the initial symptoms, which is extremely crucial for screening suspicious cases. In the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the clinical features of patients with COVID-19 at symptom onset mostly manifest as fever, dry cough, myalgia and fatigue, with or without diarrhea. 7, 9 However, based on the characteristics of virus mutations and generational transmission, .

Since the 3 rd and 4 rd -generation transmission and even asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 have appeared, 4, 8 it is urgent to distinguish the differences in clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients at admission during diverse infection periods.
In this study, we observed a small proportion of female patients admitted before January 23, considering that the sample size is not large, it is difficult to account for this phenomenon. However, surprisingly, there were several differences in admission symptoms between the two groups. Some common systemic symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, fatigue, sputum and myalgia, were more prominent in the patients admitted before January 23, but they were more insidious in patients admitted later.
However, there is still no convincing evidence to predict whether the transmission and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 will weaken during transmission. As the ""close relatives"" of SARS-CoV-2, previous studies have shown that the interpersonal transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were constantly changing. Therefore, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in different periods should be observed in detail.
Research has confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), 10-12 and ACE2 is highly expressed in nasopharyngeal cells. 13 More importantly, current research detected a high viral load in the nasopharynx soon after symptom onset. 14 Theoretically, the nasopharynx is the first virus-infected organ, but through observation, we found that infected individuals rarely show upper respiratory symptoms early in infection, and throat dryness only presented in a few patients. Research and clinical findings seem to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be colonized in the nasopharynx but has failed to be recognized in the early stage. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 could hardly be removed by self-cleaning responses such as sneeze and runny and could not be cleared immediately by the local immune system; thus, the initial symptoms of COVID-19 are insidious. Our previous study also indicated that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 deviate from the CT results, and the outcome follows the clinical features. 15 This further illustrates the critical need to correctly identify the symptoms of COVID-19 at admission.

In addition, our study found that a larger proportion of the patients admitted earlier had decreased lymphocyte, CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in the peripheral blood. Reduced CD3 and CD8 T cells counts in the context of excessive activation of these cells have been shown to contribute to the severity and mortality of COVID-19 by causing severe immune damage. 16 The contrasting elevated SAA also reflects the infection levels of patients in various periods. Overall, changes in symptoms and laboratory results at admission reflect that SARS-CoV-2 may be undergoing a certain degree of modification, and infection in patients seems to be more insidious. Therefore, we propose that it may be of great significance in guiding the diagnosis and prevention of COVID-19 in the future if respiratory samples, especially lower respiratory samples, could be collected to detect the content of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 in patients infected at different periods.
More notably, as of now, 3 unique patients have appeared in our unit. All of them reached the discharge standard (SARS-CoV-2 negativity detected on different days), but a re-examination of their throat swabs showed positive infection days after discharge. One of them was the first confirmed medical staff in our hospital, and this patient has been isolated for more than 20 days after reaching the discharge standard; the remaining 2 patients were isolated 14 days after discharge. These data indicate that the current knowledge of COVID-19 is still insufficient. As the generations of transmissions increase, the clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 are changing. The presence of asymptomatic infection also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza, 17 or it may be latent in humans for a long time. However, the limitation of this article is that the number of cases is small so that there may be bias.

0acc1f9a1c333a9a6b2dbba4a252d7576f024783,"Motivation: Understanding the relationship between the sequence, structure, binding energy, binding kinetics and binding thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions is crucial to understanding cellular signaling, the assembly and regulation of molecular complexes, the mechanisms through which mutations lead to disease, and protein engineering. Results: We present SKEMPI 2.0, a major update to our database of binding free energy changes upon mutation for structurally resolved protein-protein interactions. This version now contains manually curated binding data for 7085 mutations, an increase of 133%, including changes in kinetics for 1844 mutations, enthalpy and entropy changes for 443 mutations, and 440 mutations which abolish detectable binding. Availability:
The database is available at","Protein-protein interactions are central to almost all biological processes, from cellular signal transduction and the assembly of mesoscopic structures such as myofilaments, to viral adhesion and the immune response. Consequently the effects of changes in protein sequence on the structure, thermodynamics and kinetics of protein-protein interactions has wide implications for constraining the permissible substitutions that accrue over the course of evolution, and for understanding the molecular etiology of disease. Methods which measure, predict or optimise these changes have applications in designing de novo interactions [20] , enhancing the specificity and affinity of biological therapeutics (e.g. [3] ), designing combinatorial protein libraries (e.g. [24] ), uncovering the effects of pathological mutations (e.g. [72] ), locating druggable binding sites (e.g. [68] ) and binding hotspots for drug design [25] , altering binding kinetics [13] , [64] , protein-protein docking (e.g. [19] ), and characterising transition states (e.g. [75] ), binding pathways [61] , and sequence-affinity landscapes [2] .
SKEMPI is a manually curated database of mutations in structurally characterised protein-protein interactions and the effect of those mutations on binding affinity and other parameters [47] . The first release has been used as a basis for many further studies, including the development of energy functions [48] , [46] which were subsequently implemented in the CCharPPI web server for characterising protein-protein interactions [49] , as well as being used for ranking docked poses [45] , [58] , [6] , [50] . SKEMPI has also been used to study human disease [56] , [16] , [55] , assessing the role of dynamics on binding [69] , exploring the conservation of binding regions [28] , evaluating experimental affinity measurement methods [22] , as well serving as a data source for models which predict dissociation rate changes upon mutation [1] , pathological mutations [23] , hotspot residues (e.g. [30] , [44] , [42] , [66] ) and changes in binding energy (e.g. [60] , [17] , [78] , [7] , [53] , [51] , [57] , [18] , [39] , [76] , [54] , [77] , [37] , [5] ). Here we present a major update to the benchmark in terms of the number of mutations in the database and the number of different systems included (Table I) . We now also include details of the experimental method for all entries, based on the categories of [22] , as well as mutations which abolished detectable binding or for which only an upper or lower affinity limit could be ascertained for the wild-type or mutant.
Just over two fifths of the data come from the previous version of SKEMPI [47] , comprised mostly of data found in literature sources which came to the authors' attention, in some cases during the data collection for the structural affinity benchmark [33] and following references therein. Some entries in SKEMPI 1.1 were found by checking the references in the ASEdb [71] and PINT [36] databases, although not all the data passed the checks required for inclusion (see section II-B). Similarly, most of the new data in SKEMPI 2.0 was found by searching the literature, partly in tandem with the literature search for the more recent structural affinity benchmark [73] . During data collection three other relevant databases were published: ABbind [67] , PROXiMATE [31] and dbMPIKT [41] . Their references were checked if they were not already included. Data from these sources comprise 4%, 3% and 6% of SKEMPI 2.0 respectively. As with ASEdb and PINT, none of the data were directly copied into SKEMPI. Moreover, the cited papers were read and data entered using the same checks and procedures as other entries.
Each entry was found in the literature and manually vetted. To ensure quality, a number of stringent checks were applied. Firstly, we ensured that the structure and the paper reporting the affinities refer to the same protein in the same species, and that structural and affinity data matched in terms of cofactors, ancillary chains and post-translational modifications. For instance, we distinguish between Ras GTP and Ras GppNHp , as the nucleotide modulates the affinity of Ras with its effectors. Where the full length protein was not used, we checked to ensure that the fragment in the crystal structure matched that for which affinities are reported.
Once the checks are passed, the data is collected, including the PDB file, the chains of the interacting subunits, the mutation, the wild-type and mutant affinities (K D , M ), the reference, the names of the proteins, the temperature at which the experiment is performed (T , K), the experimental method used (an extension of the category scheme of [22] ), notes on the entry and, when available, the association rate (k on , M −1 s −1 ), dissociation rate (k off , s −1 ), enthalpy (∆H, kcal.mol −1 ) and entropy (∆S, cal.mol −1 .K −1 ). For cases where multiple PDB entries are available, the higher resolution structure is chosen. Where affinities or kinetic or thermodynamic parameters are reported in different units, these are converted to the units specified above. In some cases, when not reported directly, K D , k on , k off , ∆H and ∆S were calculated using the relationships ∆G = ∆H − T ∆S = RT ln(K D ) and K D = 1/K A = k off /k on . To ensure consistency, the residue numbering in SKEMPI is the same as that reported in the PDB file. Thus the numbering is often shifted or altered compared to that in the cited paper such that, for instance, if a crystal structure of an antibody is reported in the Kabat numbering scheme but the mutation data is not, then the mutation data is converted before entry into SKEMPI. For all entries it is the case that the the affinity reported in the ""wild-type"" column corresponds to that of the PDB file, and the affinity in the ""mutant"" column is that after applying the specified mutation to the protein in the PDB file. Thus, where there are cases in which the PDB reports a mutant form and the entry corresponds to the reverse mutation back to the wild-type, the affinity of the former appears in the ""wild-type"" column and the latter in the ""mutant"" column. Such cases are noted in the database.
In addition to checking new entries, we reappraised the papers cited in SKEMPI 1.1 to collect data that were not collected previously, specifically to find mutants which abolish binding and to classify the experimental method used when not already included in the subset of SKEMPI covered in [22] . It is worth noting that often an author's decision to report an interaction of affinity below the detection threshold as either non-binding, or as less affine than the weakest affinity presented in the paper, is arbitrary. Thus, those wishing to use the non-binding data as an inequality on the affinity may do so. We also corrected entries for 5 wild-type and 4 mutant affinities identified by [22] .
In addition to the above data, SKEMPI 2.0 also provides data on the location of the mutated residues, the homology between interactions in the data set, and processed PDB files which can be easily parsed.
Residue location: Each mutated residue is classified according to the scheme proposed by [38] ; residues at the interface are classified as support (mostly buried when unbound and entirely buried upon binding), core (mostly solvent exposed when unbound but buried upon binding) and rim (partly buried upon binding), while residues away from the binding site are classified as interior or surface. Solvent exposed surface area was calculated using CCP4 [74] .
Processed PDB files: The PDB files for the interactions, as downloaded from the Protein Data Bank [8] , often contain multiple copies of the interacting proteins in the unit cell or other chains irrelevant to the interaction. In one instance, the binding of dimeric myostatin to follistatin-like 3, the myostatin dimer must be created by tessellating the unit cell. Further, some PDB files contain features that are not readily parsed by some software, such as residue insertion codes or negative residue numbers. To help users we provide ""cleaned"" PDB files which contain only the chains of interest, renumbered from one, as well as waters and other molecules with a non-hydrogen atom within 5Å of a nonhydrogen atom of any of the chains of interest. Consequently each mutation is reported with both PDB numbering and renumbered.
Defining homologous interactions: Each entry also specifies which other entries are mutations to homologous interactions. Two interactions are deemed homologous if they have a shared binding partner or homologous binding partner and at least 70% of the corresponding interface residues are common to both interactions. We determine the homology between proteins using the GAP4 program [29] , and define homologous proteins as those with a similarity score greater than 50 and at least 30% sequence identity. Interface residues are defined as those with a non-hydrogen atom within 10Å of a non-hydrogen atom on the binding partner. Interactions falling within manually assigned clusters of homologous interactions are designated as pMHC/TCR, antibody/antigen or protease/inhibitor. While the names of these clusters have been chosen to reflect the predominant function of their constituent interactions, they reflect the homologies within the data set and are not functional assignments. Thus, for instance, some nanobodies are classified as antibodies as they bind to the same site as cetuximab, 14.3.d is classified as TCR, even though it is only the β chain, and its binding partner, enterotoxin C3, is classified as a pMHC.
In total 7085 entries were collected, summarised in Table I and Figure 1A . These data were derived from the literature and consequently, while encompassing a broad range of residues, proteins, interactions and systems, are biased toward the interests and capabilities of the research community. These biases are evident in the composition of the database according to parameters shown in Figure 1 . The ∆∆G values span a large range, but mostly fall within -3 to 7 kcal.mol −1 (Figure 1B) , for both biophysical and technical reasons (see Section III-C). Almost three quarters of the data correspond to single point mutations, and more than half of those are mutations to alanine ( Figure 1C ). Charge swap mutations and mutations between aromatic residues are also over-represented. Most single point mutations are located at the binding site, and most of those are at the core of the interface. Similarly, most double mutations are both in the binding site, and most of those are both in the core. By far the most popular methods for measuring binding affinity were surface plasmon resonance and spectroscopic methods such as fluorescence. Large biases towards specific interactions and classes of interaction are also present, such as early studies into protease inhibition and immunological interactions such as antibody-antigen complexes, the recognition of peptides presented on cell surfaces by T-cell receptors, cytokine signalling and the complement system. Indeed, almost half of the data corresponds to protease-inhibitor, antibody-antigen and pMHC/TCR interactions alone. While many interactions within these classes share common binding sites or homologous binding sites (Figure 2 ), there are also connections between these groups, for instance via inhibitory antibodies which bind to a protease active site, or due to common binding regions of proteins in the immuoglobulin superfamily, such as antibodies, TCRs, MHCs and β-2 microglobulin. Also present in the data are smaller clusters of shared and homologous interactions, such as the Raseffector cluster. These relationships are noted in the database and may be useful for avoiding overfitting when developing models or for validation and estimating generalisation error, as described previously [47] .
The entries also vary in the degree of structural order. While most correspond to interactions between folded domains, the database contains entries in which structuring occurs upon binding, such as protein-peptide interactions and, in the extreme case, the ACTR/NCBD interaction in which both binding partners become ordered upon binding [32] . Indeed, the requirements of having a structure in order to be included in the data set, ipso facto biases the data, and means that there is no representation of ""fuzzy"" complexes in which a diffuse structural ensemble in the bound state prevents the formation of a resolvable crystal.
Another source of variation is the origins of the interacting proteins. While entries range from viral and bacterial to the higher eukaryotes, biases are evident in the over-representation of model organisms including humans. With the exception of the pMHC-TCR, antibody-antigen and protease-inhibitor classes, most of the interactions are endogenous. Nevertheless, the set also includes exogenous interactions ranging from those between proteins from different individuals within the same species, namely the sex fusion proteins Juno and Izumo1 from human sperm and egg respectively [4] , to host-pathogen interactions such as adenovirus and coronavirus interactions with human receptors during viral entry [65] , [27] , to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by the snake venom neurotoxin fasciculin [2] . For the pMHC-TCR interactions there are a variety of presented antigens, including exogenous viral peptides and gluten, as well as endogenous autoimmune and cancer peptides. The antibody interactions include pathogen antibodies, as well as antibodies raised and optimised to target extracellular therapeutic targets. The protease interactions are mostly exogenous, arising from their inherent cross-reactivity due to the convergent evolution of their canonical inhibitory loop.
The investigations from which SKEMPI data is derived are diverse, spanning many biological processes and reported in 295 publications including systematic scans, alanine and homolog scanning, design studies including computational design and designs derived from phage display, double mutant cycle studies, antibody engineering, biologic drug design and the evaluation of pathological mutations. The largest contribution comes from the group of the late Michael Laskowski Jr., a systematic study of all possible mutations at selected sites in the turkey ovomucoid third domain and its inhibitory interactions with four proteases [43] , as well as studies of interactions of the same domain in other bird species and the design of ultra-high affinity broad-spectrum inhibitors. Substantial data also come from investigations into the inhibitory interactions of class A β-lactamases from the groups of Gideon Schreiber (e.g. [62] ) and Timothy Palzkill (e.g. [10] ), as well as cytokine receptor interactions, in particular studies of type I interferons also from the Schreiber group (e.g. [63] ) and that of K. Christopher Garcia [70] , but also the study of the GM-CSF / GMRα interaction from the group of Michael W. Parker [9] . Other prominent sources of data are studies into hormone receptor interactions, in particular the human growth hormone receptor from the group of Jim Wells (e.g. [14] ) and the prolactin receptor from the group of Michael E. Hodsdon [35] , as well as studies into antigen recognition including the combined computational and experimental design study to enhance affinity of the AQC2 antibody to integrin α-1 from the group of Herman Van Vlijmen [12] , the dissection of the interactions of broadly neutralising antibodies targeting HIV gp120 [11] from the group of Richard A. Friesner, and various investigations from the group of Roy A. Mariuzza (e.g. [15] ). Also notable is the alanine scanning of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor from the group of Michael Ploug [21] , studies of Ras effector interactions from the group of Christian Herrmann (e.g. [34] ), investigations of pMHC/TCR interactions from the group of Brian Baker (e.g. [59] ), and investigations into the congate and non-cognate recognition of E. coli colicin DNase bacteriotoxins by their immunity proteins from the group of Colin Kleanthous (e.g. [40] ).
Range: The changes in binding free energy upon mutation range from -12.4 to 12.4 kcal.mol −1 , as in SKEMPI 1.1, with ∆ log 10 k on ranging from -3.6 to 2.4, ∆ log 10 k off ranging from -6.0 to 6.8, ∆∆H ranging from -18.3 to 26.5 kcal.mol −1 , and ∆∆S ranging from -61 to 80 cal.mol −1 .K −1 . Around 60 mutant are very destabilising, reducing binding energy by 8 kcal.mol −1 or more. These are all in enzyme/inhibitor complexes such as the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by the snake venom fasciculin, or the inhibition of enzymes which would be detrimental should they unbind and become active in the wrong location, such as nucleases (barnase / barstar, colicin E9 DNase / Im9, RNase A / angiogenin) and proteases (such as trypsin / BPTI). These interactions tend to be around picomolar affinity and are at the upper limit of what can be detected, due to the time The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/341735 doi: bioRxiv preprint required to reach equilibrium and the low concentrations required by the mass action law to probe informative regions of the binding curve. These very destabilising mutations reduce affinity into the micromolar range, near the lower limit of what can be quantified using standard methods. As a consequence of both mutant and wild-type affinities being near detection thresholds, errors in these entries are typically large. Further, while some mutations may cause changes in affinity larger than seven orders of magnitude, the absence of affinities for such mutations in the benchmark can be explained by the fact that such mutations would involve affinities beyond the upper or lower limit. Indeed, there are new entries in which single or double substitutions reduce binding from tens of picomolar to having no detectable binding. For many of the highly destabilising mutations a crystal structure for the mutant has also been solved, and the 30 most stabilising mutations in the database (∆∆G ¡ -5 kcal.mol −1 ) consist of the reverse mutation applied to these structures. These are mostly single or double mutants, but include mutations to up to 27 residues of the non-cognate Colicin E2/Im9 complex, which move it toward the cognate E9/Im9 in sequence space [40] .
Errors: Standard errors in K D are typically reported in the order of 50%, around 0.25 kcal.mol −1 . These estimates are derived by repeat measurements using the same equipment, environment and protocol, and thus do not include errors arising from systematic bias. Such biases can, however, be estimated from pairs of entries in which the same mutation is evaluated by different groups or using different techniques. For 84% of 1741 such pairs, both entries give a ∆∆G value within 1 kcal.mol −1 of each other. For 704 pairs for which k on is available for both, 80% have ∆ log 10 (k on ) within 0.5 of each other. For 702 pairs for which k off is available, 83% have ∆ log 10 (k off ) within 0.5. For the 62 pair with both ∆∆H and ∆∆S values, 61% have ∆∆H within 3.0 kcal.mol −1 of each other and 58% have ∆∆S within 10 cal.mol −1 .K −1 of each other.
Within SKEMPI some entries can be combined to construct mutant cycles, which quantify the interactions between residues, the dependence of these interactions on other residues, and other higher order effects. The most common instances are double mutant cycles, where affinities are available for the wild type, A, B and AB mutations, of which there are 610 examples. Of these, 53 involve at least one mutant for which binding was not observed, or only an inequality is available, and 235 involve mutations reported in the same reference, and thus the affinities are likely to have been measured using the same technique and conditions. A further 218 double mutant cycles can be constructed in the background of a third mutation (i.e. C, AC, BC and ABC mutations are available), of which 209 are not composed of non-binding mutations or mutations with inequalities, and 131 involve affinities coming from the same reference. Of the 766 double mutant cycles containing neither inequalities nor non-binding mutants, a number of parameters can be calculated, including ∆∆G ab→Ab , ∆∆G ab→aB and ∆∆G ab→AB , the binding free energy change of both single and the double mutation respectively, as well as ∆∆G aB→AB and ∆∆G Ab→AB , the energy of a single mutation within the context of the other mutation, and ∆∆G int = ∆∆G aB→AB -∆∆G ab→Ab = ∆∆G Ab→AB − ∆∆G ab→aB , the interaction energy of the two mutations [26] . From these, it can be deduced that 345 are additive (∆∆G int < 0.5kcal.mol −1 ). Of the non-additive cycles, 293 exhibit tighter binding in the double mutant than the sum of the single mutants (positive epistasis), of which 6 result in even tighter binding than individual effects of two single mutations that strengthen the interaction (synergistic positive), while 273 correspond to double mutants which reduce binding by less than the sum of two single mutants which reduce binding (antagonistic positive). Similarly, 128 cycles have double mutants exhibiting weaker binding than the sum of the two single mutants (negative epistasis), of which 58 contain two destabilising single mutations (synergistic negative) and 26 contain two stabilising single mutations (antagonistic negative). The range of ∆∆G int values rarely fall outside of the -5 to 3 kcal.mol −1 range. Of the 421 nonadditive cycles, 151 show noticeable sign epistasis, in which the sign of the effect of either the A or B mutation flips depending on the presence or absence of the background mutation (i.e., for the A mutation, |∆∆G ab→Ab | > 0.2 kcal.mol −1 and |∆∆G aB→AB | > 0.2 kcal.mol −1 and |∆∆G ab→Ab − ∆∆G aB→AB | > 0.4 kcal.mol −1 ). Of these, 38 correspond to mutations which destabilise the complex in the presence of the background mutation, but stabilise in its absence (destabilising sign epistasis), while 113 correspond to mutations which stabilise the complex in the mutant background but otherwise destabilise the complex (stabilising sign epistasis). Only 8 cycles exhibit the more extreme reciprocal sign epistasis, which in 6 cases are where both single mutations are stabilising (< −0.2 kcal.mol −1 ), but the double mutant is destabilising (> 0.2 kcal.mol −1 ), and the remaining two correspond to two destabilising mutations (> 0.2 kcal.mol −1 ) for which the double mutation is stabilising (< −0.2 kcal.mol −1 ). The types of substitutions that can give rise to extreme effects such as stabilising reciprocal sign epistasis can be illustrated with the Mlc-IIB Glc interaction in E. coli [52] , in which the removal of the F136 side-chain of MlC creates a large cavity at the binding interface, the addition of a phenylalanine at the A451 position of IIB Glc creates a large clash, however the double mutation creates an interaction that is even more stable than the wild-type by creating an anchor residue across the binding interface in which the cavity in MlC is filled by the new side-chain of IIB.
Higher order interaction terms can be garnered from higher cycles, such as triple mutant cubes, constructed from the energies of the wild-type, three single mutants, three corresponding double mutants and the triple mutant [26] . In SKEMPI, 45 triple mutant cubes can be made, with 10 coming from the same reference. For these, third order interaction energies fall within the -1 to 1 kcal.mol −1 range. For fourth order interactions, constructed from energies of the wild-type, four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants and the quadruple mutant, 14 examples exist within SKEMPI. However, care should be taken in ascribing meaning to fourth order residue coupling energies due to the accumulations of errors, which in these cases are exacerbated by the affinities having been reported in different publications. No fifth or higher order interactions are present.

Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.","The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 and has rapidly spread around the world. By Feb 5, 2020, more than 24000 individuals were infected and more than 490 fatalities had been reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this novel coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no specific antiviral drug for this epidemic. Considering the severity of this widespread dissemination and health threats, panic patients misled by media flocked to the pharmacies for Chinese Medicine herbs which were reported to ""inhibit"" the 2019-nCoV, despite no clinical evidence supporting the claim. Many researchers are engaged in developing anti-2019-nCoV drug s [1, 2] . However, new drug discovery and development is a long, costly and rigorous scientific process. A more effective approach is to search for anti-2019-nCoV therapies from the existing FDA-approved drug database.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing), which concerns the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic target indications, has emerged as a successful strategy for drug discovery due to the reduced costs and expedited approval procedures [3] [4] [5] . Several successful examples unveil its great values in practice: Nelfinavir, initially developed to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is now being used for cancer treatments. Amantadine was firstly designed to treat influenza caused by type A influenza viral infection and is being used for Parkinson's disease later on [6] . In recent years, the rapid growth of drug-related datasets, as well as open data initiatives, has led to new developments for computational drug repositioning, particularly, structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Machine learning, network analysis, and text mining and semantic inference are three major computational approaches commonly applied in drug repositioning [7] . The rapid accumulation of genetic and structural databases [8] , the development of low-dimensional mathematical representations of complex biomolecular structures [9, 10] , and the availability of advanced deep learning algorithms have made machine learning-based drug reposition a promising approach [7] . Considering the urgent need for anti-2019-nCoV drugs, a computational drug repositioning is one of the most feasible strategies for discovering 2019-nCoV drugs.
In SBDR, one needs to select one or a few effective targets. Study shows that 2019-nCoV genome is very close to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV [11] . The sequence identities of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease, RNA polymerase, and the spike protein with corresponding SARS-CoV proteins are 96.08%, 96%, and 76%, respectively [12] . We, therefore, hypothesize that a potent SARS 3CL protease inhibitor is also a potent 2019-nCoV 3CL protease inhibitor. Unfortunately, there is no effective SARS therapy at present. Nevertheless, the X-ray crystal structure of SARS 3CL protease has been reported [13] and the binding affinities of 115 potential SARS 3CL protease inhibitors are available in ChEMBL database [14] . Additionally, there are 15,843 protein-ligand complexes in PDBbind 2018 general set with binding affinities and X-ray crystal structures [15] . Moreover, the DrugBank contains about 1600 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [16] . The aforementioned information provides a sound foundation to develop an SBDR machine learning model for 2019-nCoV 3CL protease inhibition.
Recently, we have developed low-dimensional mathematical representations [9, 10] to reduce the structural complexity of macromolecules based on abstract mathematics, such as algebraic topology [17] [18] [19] [20] , differential geometry, and spectral graph theory [10, 21] . We exploit these representations to extract critical chemical and biological information for protein-ligand pose selection, binding affinity ranking, prediction, ranking, scoring, and screening [9, 10] . Paired with various machine learning, including deep algorithms, these approaches are the top competitor for D3R Grand Challenges, a worldwide competition series in computer-aided drug design in the past few years [22, 23] .
In responding to the pressing need for anti-2019-nCoV medications, we develop mathematics-based deep learning models to systematically eventuate FDA approved drugs in the DrugBank for 2019-nCoV 3CL protease inhibition. With the consensus of two deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks and multitask deep learning, we report the top 15 potentially highly potent anti-2019-nCoV 3CL inhibitors, which provide timely guidance for the further development of anti-2019nCoV drugs.
The sequence identity is defined as the percentage of characters that match exactly between two different sequences. The sequence identities between 2019-nCoV protease and the protease of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HKU-1, OC43, HCoVNL63, 229E, and HIV are 96.1%, 52.0%, 49.0%, 48.4%, 45.2%, 41.9%, and 23.7%, respectively. It is seen that 2019-nCoV protease is very close to SARS-CoV protease, but is distinguished from other proteases. Clearly, 2019-nCoV has a strong genetic relationship with SARS-CoV, the sequence alignment in Figure 1 further confirms their relationship. Additionally, the available experimental data of SARS-CoV protease inhibitors can be used as the training set to generate new inhibitors of 2019-nCoV protease. Since the sequences are highly identical, the 2019-nCoV protease structure can be built by homology modeling with the SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB ID: 2A5I) [13] as a template. It turns out, as shown in Fig. 2 , the homology structure of the 2019-nCoV protease is essentially identical to the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV 3CL protease. Particularly, the RMSD of two structures at the binding site is 0.21Å. The high structural similarity between the two proteases suggests that anti-SARS-CoV chemicals can be equally effective for the treatment of 2019-nCoV.
We predict the binding affinities of 1465 3D FDA-approved drugs and 2019-nCoV protease complexes using two models, 3DALL and 3DMT. 3DALL is built with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the algebraic topology-based representation of protein-ligand complexes, with 84 SARS-CoV protease inhibitors and 15843 complexes from the PDBbind 2018 general set as the training set. 3DMT, a deep 3 author/funder.

We briefly describe the predicted potentially highly potent anti-2019-nCoV drugs. The most potent one is Bortezomib, an anti-cancer medication, which is known as proteasome inhibitor and can be used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. The second drug is Flurazepam, which is a benzodiazepine derivative that possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative, and skeletal muscle 4 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The third one, Ponatinib, an oral drug for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is important to notice that this drug has the risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels. The next one is Sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor for the treatment of primary kidney cancer and liver cancer. The fifth drug, Dasatinib, is a therapy for treating certain cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The next one, Paramethasone, is a glucocorticoid with the general properties of corticosteroids. The seventh drug is Clocortolone, a topical steroid that is used in the form of an ester, clocortolone pivalate. It is interesting to note that this drug is always applied as a cream for the treatment of dermatitis. It is considered a medium-strength corticosteroid. Therefore, this drug might be used to clean 2019-nCoV contaminated materials, offering an extra layer of protection. The number eight drug, Flucloxacillin, is a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class. It is used to treat infections caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria. The next one, Sertindole, is an antipsychotic medication. The number ten drug, Clevidipine, is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that used for the reduction of blood pressure when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable. The eleventh drug, Aprepitant, is used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as postoperative nausea and vomiting. The number twelve, Atorvastatin, is a statin drug used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and treat abnormal lipid levels. The next drug is Cinolazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. The number fourteen drug, Clofazimine, is used together with rifampicin and dapsone to treat leprosy. The fifteenth number drug, Fosaprepitant, is an antiemetic medication used in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatment.
The top-ranking candidate of the existing drugs is Bortezomib (see Figure 3 (b)). Its predicted binding affinity to the nCoV-2019 protease is -12.29 kcal/mol. The high binding affinity is due to the strong hydrogen bond network formed between the drug and the nCoV-2019 protease. For example, the strongest hydrogen author/funder. All rights reserved.

The strong hydrogen bonds between this molecule and the protease are formed by five different H atoms on the head of the drug with four different O atoms in the main chains of Phe140 , Leu141, as well as the side 6 author/funder.

Another important bond is formed by the H atom in the amino of the side chain of Gln189 with the F atom of the fluorobenzene and one N atom of the 1,4-diazepane in the drug. Additionally, the O atom in the drug adjacent to the 1,4-diazepane is bonded with the amino H atom of the side chain of Glu166. Therefore, the head, tail, and body of the molecule are firmly fixed to the binding site, which promises a strong binding to the 2019-nCoV protease.
The third one, Ponatinib (see Figure 3 
It is interesting to analyze the predicted binding affinities of existing antiviral drugs developed as protease inhibitors. Their binding affinities are listed in Table 2 . It is interesting to see that except for Boceprevir, which is a protease inhibitor used to treat hepatitis caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the rest of protease inhibitors do not have a strong effect on 2019-nCoV. The predicted values by a recent study [24] are given in the parenthesis. It appears that these values are overestimated. 
Our deep learning-based drug repositioning models employ mathematical pose (MathPose) and mathematical deep learning (MathDL) to predict 3D poses and protein-ligand binding affinities. The latter is used as a major criterion for searching anti-2019-nCoV therapies from the existing FDA-approved drugs. We first build a 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure by using homology modeling. A set of SARS-CoV protease inhibitors are docked to the 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure using our MathPose. The resulting complexes are used as a set of machine learning training. Additionally, a set of protein-ligand complexes from the PDBBind database is collected as another machine learning training set. Our training accuracy in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficient is higher than 0.99 in all deep learning models.
Homology modeling, a procedure that constructs an atomic-resolution model of a protein from its amino acid sequence and experimental 3D structure of the related homologous protein, i.e., the ""template,"" is used to generate the 3D structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. The SWISS model (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) is employed with the protease structure of SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 2A5I [13] ) as a template. The sequence identity between the 3CL proteases of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV is 96.08%.
ChEMBL [14] , an open database that brings chemical, bioactivity, and genomic data together to translate genomic information into effective new drugs, is employed to construct our 2019-nCoV training set. Considering the high sequence identity between viral proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, we take the protease of SARS-CoV as the input target in ChEMBL and a total 115 ChEMBL IDs of the target can be found. The experimental ∆G values of 2019-nCoV 115 SARS-CoV protease inhibition compounds range from −10.0 kcal/mol to 7.5 kcal/mol. We exclude compounds with positive values, resulting in a total of 84 SARS-nCoV protease inhibition compounds for our machine learning training. A collection of these 84 compounds is given in the Supplementary Materials.
The PDBbind database is a yearly updated collection of experimentally measured binding affinity data (Kd, Ki, and IC50) for the protein-ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The PDBbind general set, instead of the high-quality refined set, is chosen as our training set because of the FDA approved drugs involve a wide range of protein targets. In the current work, we use a set of 15,843 X-ray crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes and associated binding affinities from the PDBbind v2018 general set [15] . The information of these complexes is provided in the Supplementary Materials.
DrugBank (www.drugbank.ca) is a richly annotated, freely accessible online database that integrates massive drug, drug target, drug action, and drug interaction information about FDA-approved drugs with the experimental drugs which are going through the FDA approval process [16] .

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.936013 doi: bioRxiv preprint resources used all over the world. A total of 1553 FDA-approved drugs are contained in the DrugBank. However, in the present work, a number of FDA-approved drugs encountered difficulties in docking with the target molecule. Therefore, the MathPose successfully created 3D protein-ligand complex structures for 1465 FDA-approved drugs and 2019-nCoV protease. MathDL, designed for predicting various druggable properties of 3D molecules [23] , is capable of efficiently and accurately encoding the high-dimensional biomolecular interactions into low-dimensional representations. Algebraic graph theory-based algorithms [25] , differential geometry, and algebraic topology methods [23] are applied to generate three mathematical representations of data in MathDL. These data representations can be integrated with well-designed deep learning models, such as gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for pose ranking and binding affinity predictions. In D3R Grand Challenges (https://drugdesigndata.org/about/grand-challenge), a worldwide competition series in computer-aided drug design, MathDL had been proved as the top performer in free energy prediction and ranking [22, 23] . Figure 4 illustrates the framework of the MathDL model, which combined the aforementioned mathematical representations with the CNN architecture for druggable properties predictions. The PDBbind 2018 general set [15] , along with the SARS 3CL protease related dataset is used in our training process. In this section, we briefly describe the algebraic topology representation used in the present work. Details can be found in the literature [23] .
Even with a glimpse of topology, one can realize it dramatically simplifies geometric complexity [9, [17] [18] [19] [20] . The study of topology reveals characterizes of different dimensions. As a type of algebraic topology, 9 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . simplicial homology studies complexes on discrete datasets under various settings, such as the Vietoris-Rips (VR) complex,Čech complex or alpha complex, and identifies the topological invariants of a pointcloud dataset such as atomic coordinates in a protein [26] . Separated components, rings, and cavities can be classified for a given configuration and their numbers are referred to as Betti-0, Betti-1, and Betti-2, respectively. In this topological analysis process, the metrics or coordinates are fully abandoned. Instead, geometric and topological information is captured as data representation. Moreover, as a new development branch of algebraic topology, persistent homology which combines multiscale geometric information and topological invariants to achieve a geometry-enriched topological characteristic, e.g., barcodes. Therefore, the ""birth"" and ""death"" of separated components, circles, rings, voids or cavities can be indicated at all spatial scales by topological measurements. Key concepts are briefly shown as following.
In algebraic topology, simplices are the essential building blocks. Let v 0 , v 1 , v 2 , · · · , v k be k +1 affinely independent points. A (geometric) k-simplex σ k is the linear combinations of these points in R n (n ≥ k), whose coefficients are positive and satisfy that their summation equals to 1. For example, a 0, 1, 2, or 3simplex is considered as a vertex, an edge, a triangle, or a tetrahedron, respectively. A simplicial complex K is a topological space composed of simplices which satisfies that every face of a simplex σ k ∈ K is also in K and the non-empty intersection of any two simplices is a face for both. To identify the homology group, a k-chain [σ k ] is a summation i α i σ k i of k-simplices σ k i , and the set of all k-chains of the simplicial complex K equipped with an algebraic field (typically, Z 2 ) forms an abelian group C k (K, Z 2 ). The homology defined on a series of abelian groups is used to analyze topological invariants which requires boundary operators to connect these chain spaces. The boundary operators ∂ k :
Consequently, a important property of boundary operator, ∂ k−1 ∂ k = ∅, follows from that boundaries are boundaryless. The algebraic construction to connect a sequence of complexes by boundary maps is called a chain complex
and the kth homology group is the quotient group defined by
where the k-cycle group Z k and the k-boundary group B k are the subgroups of C k defined as,
The aforementioned property implies B k ⊆ Z k ⊆ C k . The Betti numbers are defined by the ranks of kth homology group H k which counts k-dimensional holes, especially, β 0 = rank(H 0 ) reflects the number of connected components, β 1 = rank(H 1 ) reflects the number of loops, and β 2 = rank(H 2 ) reveals the number of voids or cavities. Together, the set of Betti numbers {β 0 , β 1 , β 2 , · · · } indicates the intrinsic topological property of a system.
Persistent homology [18] is devised to track the multiscale topological information over different scales along a filtration. A filtration of a topology space K is a nested sequence of subspaces {K t } t=0,...,m of K such that ∅ = K 0 ⊆ K 1 ⊆ K 2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ K m = K. Moreover, on this complex sequence, we obtain a sequence of chain complexes by homomorphisms: C * (K 0 ) → C * (K 1 ) → · · · → C * (K m ) and a homology sequence:
where B t+p k = im∂ k+1 (K t+p ). Intuitively, this homology group records the homology classes of K t that are persistent at least until K t+p . Under the filtration process, the persistent homology barcodes can be generated. To make use of advanced deep learning algorithms, we vectorize persistent homology barcodes by dividing them into bins and calculating persistence, birth, and death incidents in each bin. Furthermore, the statistics of element-specific persistent homology barcodes are taken into consideration as well in fixedlength features.
MathPose, a 3D pose predictor which converts SMILES strings into 3D poses with references of target molecules, was the top performer in D3R Grand Challenge 4 in predicting the poses of 24 beta-secretase 1 (BACE) binders [23] . For one SMILES string, around 1000 3D structures can be generated by a common docking software tool, i.e., GLIDE [27] . Moreover, a selected set of known complexes is re-docked by the three docking software packages mentioned above to generate at 100 decoy complexes per input ligand as a machine learning training set. The machine learning labels will be the calculated root mean squared deviations (RMSDs) between the decoy and native structures for this training set. Furthermore, MathDL models will be set up and applied to select the top-ranked pose for the given ligand. Additionally, the top poses will be fed into the MathDL for druggable proprieties evaluation.
The current pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (CoV), called 2019-nCoV in China, has evolved into a global health emergency declared by the World Health Organization. Although there is no effective anti-viral medicine for the 2019-nCoV, the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have a sequence identity of 96%, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. We build a three-dimensional (3D) 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure using a SARS-CoV 3CL protease crystal structure as a template and collect a set of 84 SARS-CoV inhibition experimental data. The molecules of this set are docked to the 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure to form a machine learning training set. Additionally, the PDBbind 2018 general set of 15,843 protein-ligand complexes is also included as an additional machine learning training set. Using these training sets, we develop two deep learning models based on low-dimensional algebraic topology representations of macromolecular complexes. A total of 1465 FDA-approved drugs is evaluated by their binding affinities predicted by the consensus of two models built with 1) a combination of algebraic topology and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and 2) a combination of algebraic topology and deep multitask CNNs. According to the predicted binding affinities, we recommend many FDA-approved drugs as potentially highly potent medications to 2019-nCoV, which serve as a crucial step for the development of anti-2019-nCoV drugs.

0b282573f5c63c943021c10ca39a1ed21acfb429,"Two months after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has already spread worldwide. However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.","In Dec. 31st, 2019, Chinese authorities reported an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease, called COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Due to the proximity of the Spring Festival, the Chinese Government implemented quarantine in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, as well as in several nearby cities since Jan. 23rd, 2020. As of Feb. 16th the outbreak is still growing and has already infected 68,584 individuals in China of which 1,666 have died [1] . Much is still unknown about the characteristics of this pathogen. For instance, it remains unclear the animal source of this zoonotic disease, being bats and pangolins currently the two most likely sources [2] [3] [4] . It has also been proposed that more than half of the cases might have gone undetected by routinely screening passengers, due to the special characteristics of this disease [5] , which makes it possible that infected individuals are asymptomatic while infectious.
Several studies predict a much larger number of infections than the actual number reported by the authorities, claiming that only between 10% and 20% of the cases have been detected and reported [6] [7] [8] [9] . The reasons for such deviations between models and actual count of cases are diverse, for instance, the fact that the symptoms could be mild and similar to other flue-like diseases for some people, may induce infected individuals not to seek medical care [10] . On the other hand, on Feb. 13th, 14,840 new cases were reported [11] , in contrast to 2,022 cases counted during the previous day [12] . The reason was that previously to that day, only those cases that had been laboratory-confirmed were being recognized as so, whereas from that date onwards, also the clinically diagnosed cases are accounted for. Therefore, the model-based prediction of the numbers of infected individuals can plausibly be larger than the official reports.
From a theoretical and computational point of view, there are groups that have proposed new epidemic models to properly account for the special characteristics of this disease [10, 13, 14] . However, our knowledge of the dynamics of the disease is too limited to be constrained to use such sophisticated models. In fact, in some of these works, the models are fitted to reproduce exactly the reported number of infected individuals, which, as noted before, can be counterproductive given that the actual number of infected individuals in the population is surely higher than those detected either by clinical diagnosis or in the laboratory. Lastly, there has also been intense research aimed at computing the probability that the outbreak extends beyond Wuhan to other cities in China, as well as to the rest of the world [6, 7, [15] [16] [17] [18] . These works use historical data in order to produce a risk assessment and obtain probabilities that the disease is imported in other populations. Likewise, modeling efforts have been directed towards gauging the effect of Wuhan's quarantine on the spreading of the epidemic all over the country (which so far has determined to be a delay of 3 days in the arrival of the peak) and worldwide.
Given the unprecedented characteristics of this outbreak, we here adopt a slightly different approach and study a data-driven metapopulation model that makes use of the actual flows of the population to properly measure the early effects of the travel reductions in China. Specifically, we built a basic metapopulation model [19, 20] of 31 regions in China (except HongKong, Macau and Taiwan). Inside each population, we considered that the individuals in the population interact following a homogeneous mixing scheme. This approach is similar to the ones proposed in [7] and [15] . However, in our case, we perform a data-driven simulation with the actual flows of individuals that have taken during the period of study. That is to say, we do not rely on transportation data (which is most of the time given as the maximum flow capacity between subpopulations), but on a real dataset gathered for this occasion (see Materials and Methods). Given that we restrict the analysis to mainland China, this dataset could be better suited for relatively small scale movements. As recently reported, our modeling framework also allows to make an early assessment of the impact that travel restrictions have had on the spreading of the epidemic in mainland China. The results align with previous findings and indicate that travel restrictions do not have a significant impact in containing the expansion of the disease, though reducing the flow of individuals could lead to a delay in the importation of new cases in other subpopulations. Importantly, ours is another study in which taking the mobility patterns into account in as realistic as possible way emerges as a key factor for modeling purposes. In this sense, our conclusions point out that despite the many advances in disease modeling during the last two decades, there still remain many open challenges, most of them related to how to sensibly incorporate human behavioral changes and response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
We implement a stochastic SEIR-metapopulation model to simulate the spread of the epidemic across mainland China. The model can be divided in two discrete processes: the disease dynamics governed by a SEIR compartmental model; and the mobility of individuals. In a SEIR compartmental model individuals are assigned into each group according to their health status: susceptible (S) if they are susceptible to the disease; exposed (E) if they have been infected but are still asymptomatic; infected (I) once the incubation period is over and the individuals show symptoms and can infect others; and removed (R) when they are either recovered or deceased. Within each subpopulation (henceforth, region), the transition between compartments results from the following rules, iterated at each time step, corresponding to 1 day: S→E: Susceptible individuals in region i might get infected with probability P (S → I) = 1 − (1 − R 0 /(T E N i )) I i , where R 0 is the reproduction number, T E the mean incubation time, N i the number of individuals in region i and I i the number of infected individuals in mentioned region. E→I: Exposed individuals enter the infected compartment with a rate inversely proportional to the mean latent period, T E .
I→R: Infected individuals enter the removed compartment with a rate inversely proportional to the mean infectious period, T I .
Note that the generation time is thus T g = T E + T I . On the other hand, the mobility of individuals is implemented through a data-driven approach. We have obtained the number of individuals leaving each region each day, N o i , as well as the probability, p ij , of going from each region i to region j (see Materials and Methods for a thorough description of the data). Hence, at each time step, we select N o i individuals at random from within each region −excluding infected individuals in i, which are supposed to be under quarantine or hospitalized−, and distribute them across the country according to such probabilities. Note, however, that there could be exposed individuals, which are those that ultimately will bring the disease to other subpopulations. We also implemented a randomized version of the model for the mobility, in which the fraction of the population traveling from each region at each time step is 0.008 (estimated from the average fraction of individuals traveling during the first week of January 2020) and their destinations are chosen randomly with probability proportional to the population of the destination region.
Furthermore, since we have data of N o i from 2019 and 2020, we simulated the spreading of the disease in both years. In this way, we are able to asses the impact of travel reductions due to mobility restrictions across subpopulations without making any − however sensible− assumptions about possible changes in individuals' mobility.

In 2020, the Spring Festival was celebrated on Jan. 25th, while in 2019 it took place on Feb. 5th. For this reason, we align both simulations so that ""day 0"" will correspond in both years to the day of the Spring Festival (Jan. 25th and Feb. 5th respectively). As a consequence, we start the simulations on Jan. 12th, 2019 and Jan. 1st, 2020, so that in both years the period between the first reported cases and the celebration of the Spring Festival is the same. Lastly, the simulation will run in both cases to 13 days after the Festival, which corresponds to Feb. 5th in 2020 and Feb. 16th in 2019. Fig. 1 clearly shows that the changes induced by the epidemic in the overall flow and movement of the population throughout China is not restricted just to the region in which the city of Wuhan is located (Hubei). In 2019, a large number of individuals moved right before the Spring Festival. Then, it reached a minimum at the Spring Festival and later on, again, a large number of individuals moved again, see Fig. 1A . On the other hand, in 2020, the situation was similar only until Jan. 23rd, when the travel restrictions in Wuhan were implemented. Two features are worth highlighting. First, when the travel restrictions were implemented, the flow of population had peaked already just before the Spring festival. This is key to understand why, despite the reduction in mobility, the daily number of new cases have continued to increase for weeks. Secondly, most of the second wave observed in 2019 − which corresponds to travel back to the original region− might have not taken place yet (see Fig. 1B ), and thus, there is still a high risk that a subsequent large outbreak or increase in the number of newly infected individuals happens. The existence of recurrent local outbreaks is a feature that some models have anticipated [20] . Further indications that the population has not yet reached the original distribution by region are provided in Figs. 1C and 1D , where we show the number of individuals living in each region at the beginning of the simulation (initial data obtained from the Chinese Yearbook, see Materials and Methods) and at the end according to our data. Clearly, while in 2019 most of the population returned to their regions, in 2020 this has not taken place yet.
To parameterize the metapopulation epidemiological model we follow Chinazzi et al. [7] and set a generation time of 7.5 days and a reproduction number R 0 equal to 2.4. The latent period is set to 3 days [21] . Although similar . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. values have been reported by other groups, we have also tested larger values of these parameters and the results are consistent (see Materials and Methods) with those reported in what follows. The outbreak is seeded by introducing 40 exposed individuals on Jan. 1st (Jan. 12th in 2019) [7] . Then, the simulations run for 35 days in both cases and we extract the cumulative number of infected cases in each region as a function of time. Note that as there was no travel restriction in 2019, one can see the results obtained with the 2019 data as the more plausible outcome for the 2020 outbreak should travel restrictions were not adopted. In other words, by comparing 2019 with 2020, we can factor out the impact of the early travel reduction in the city of Wuhan and the subsequent changes in the mobility pattern of the population. Fig. 2 shows the cumulative number of infected individuals for Hubei and for the rest of mainland China. The large majority of cases, in all situations considered, are contained within Hubei province. However, when we look at the predictions on the rest of the country, we begin to see growing differences between the scenarios analyzed. The results in Fig. 2B also show that travel restrictions have a positive impact in the temporal evolution of the disease (compare 2019 with 2020), in so far the reduction in the flow of individuals delays the spreading of the disease to the rest of mainland China. However, as it can also be deduced from the trend of the curves in Fig. 2B , there is no indication that the growth in the number of cases will evolve following a different functional form. In other words, if no further measures are taken and no modifications are made to the model, one would find that the number of simulated cases at day τ in 2019 would be the same ∆ days after τ in 2020. Fig. 2A also shows that there is a large difference between the cumulative number of cases predicted in 2020 and the reported one. Although, as previously discussed, this has been reported by several other studies, to ensure that the methodology is correct, and to further analyze the effect of the mobility pattern, in Fig. 3 we show the correlation between the real values of infected individuals and the simulated ones for 2020. We obtain a Pearson correlation of 0.81 implying that the assumptions behind the model, albeit simplistic, can correctly describe the basic dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, we also see that the data-driven model is able to predict better the dynamics than its random counterpart. Lastly, we have also studied the difference in the predicted number of cases in each region between 2019 and 2020 at the end of the simulation period. Results are reported in Table I , where we show the median as well as the corresponding 5-95% quantiles. As it can be seen in the Table, in the vast majority of the regions the predicted number of cases in the scenario in which travel is not banned (2019) is larger than for those obtained with data from 2020. Interestingly, there are some regions in which the situation reverses. We have no explanation for this (small) negative deviations.
Summarizing, we have studied a data-driven metapopulation model that allows assessing the effects of early travel restrictions in Wuhan and Hubei province. Even if our modeling framework is simpler than other more sophisticated We also note that the observed shift of the epidemic curve and the effect of travel restriction might be underestimated because the large majority of people had already moved before these mobility restrictions were implemented (as it can be seen in Fig. 1 ). Our study is limited in several aspects that can constitute future research goals. First, the geographic resolution allowed by the mobility data used here is low. Considering large regions have the undesired effect that one can not add structure to the population and therefore the dynamics within each subpopulation is constrained by the homogeneous mixing hypothesis. This limitation could be overcome if less granular spatial and temporal data becomes available. Secondly, and perhaps more important as it currently represents a scientific challenge, we have assumed that the transmissibility does not change during the whole simulation period. This implies that changes in behavioral patterns of the population are not fully accounted for nor they can be completely disentangled from those associated with travel restrictions. Understanding how to deal with such behavioral changes is key for the development of more realistic descriptions of the large-scale spreading of diseases. Finally, another critical feature of current models that needs to be improved in future research is the use of disease parameters −notably R 0 − that are constant both in time and across populations. 
Data description Resident population. The statistics about the distribution of the population across 31 regions in China were obtained from the ""China Statistical Yearbook 2019"" [22] . This annual publication reflects comprehensively the economic and social development of China.
Population flow. We obtained migration data from Baidu Quanxi, an open platform based on Baidu Location Based Services (LBS) that provides information about the population flow within China [23] . The dataset comprises two types of data: the Baidu migration index and the Baidu migration ratio. The former is a number proportional to the number of individuals leaving each region. To obtain the proportionality constant, we averaged the amount of individuals leaving Wuhan between Jan. 1st and 10th and compared it to the value of 502,013 estimated by Wu et al. [15] . The second part of the dataset contains the fraction of individuals going from region i to region j, p ij . As such, it is possible to estimate the number of individuals going from region i to j by multiplying the total outflow of the region by the corresponding p ij . The outflow of the individuals is available for the years 2019 and 2020, while the p ij values only for 2020. Nevertheless, as it can be seen in Fig.1 in the main text, it represents a good proxy of the situation in 2019. Indeed, even though some populations were closed after Jan. 23rd, 2020, using these values for 2019 correctly describes the return of the population that had left for the Spring Festival. To gauge the effect of the chosen parameterization of the model, we have repeated the analysis with several values reported in the literature [7, 24] . As expected, if the incubation period is larger or the basic reproduction number is smaller, the overall number of cases decreases. Conversely, when using large values of R 0 or longer generation times, the amount of infected individuals increases. In any case, the mobility model is quite independent from the dynamics of the disease, since the correlation is almost always the same in all cases considered.",A data-driven assessment of early travel restrictions related to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 within mainland China,medrxiv,10.1101/2020.03.05.20031740,,,medrvix,2020-03-08,Alberto Aleta; Qitong Hu; Jiachen Ye; Peng Ji; Yamir Moreno,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv
0b460e73926eb107001c95c0dfeae2362b4251b0,"With the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 , infected patients within and beyond the epidemic area, Wuhan, China, showed different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan.
We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum.
: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19
patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens.
We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus.","At the beginning of December 2019, a cluster of ""pneumonia of unknown aetiology"" emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has soon developed into an outbreak posing a pandemic threat. Since no causative pathogen was identified at the onset of the disease, it was once called ""Wuhan pneumonia"" by the health officials and the public. On December 31, 2019, a total of 27 cases were reported; meanwhile, a rapid response team led by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) was formed to conduct detailed epidemiologic and aetiologic investigations in Wuhan. 1

Only 4 people (13.33%) of this group had specific-IgM antibody detected in their serum, suggesting asymptomatic infection with single virus (IFV-B). The total infection rate in healthy control was significantly lower than that in COVID-19 patients (P<0.0001, Table 4 ), and none of the individual in control group showed evidence of combined infection with two or more pathogens. The climatic characteristics of Qingdao and Wuhan from December to January of following year were shown in Table 5 , where differences could be observed between the two cities.
Although the climate in Qingdao is drier and colder than Wuhan, major respiratory pathogens circulate in the two cities were quite similar.
This is an extended descriptive study on COVID-19 patients between Wuhan and Qingdao, represented as within and beyond the epidemic centre, respectively. Since the early onset of COVID-19 till the specific definition of novel coronavirus (previously known as 2019-nCoV) releasing on January 7, 2020, 4 the term ""illness/pneumonia of unknown aetiology"" was repeatedly quoted by the health officials and the public during this one-month period. One of the possible explanations for such failure to clearly define the disease is that no causative pathogen could be found at the early stage. We speculated that if any common respiratory pathogen, such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses, RSV, ADV, MP and CP, or the previous emerging novel coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was isolated from body fluids and secretions of the infected patients, related treatment and management could have been implemented in the first place. As such, it was very unlikely that ""pneumonia of unknown causes"" would still be emphasized, although this might cause delay in the discovery of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we assumed that the possibility of coinfection in All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Our assumption was led support by two recent studies conducted in Wuhan showing that there was no coinfection of respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 cases. 3, 9 According to our data, the majority of COVID-19 patients in Qingdao were not from the endemic area; they were infected indirectly without a history of traveling to Wuhan. Despite the high coinfection rate in Qingdao patients who had more complicated clinical conditions Here we also compared the geographical and climatic characteristics of Qingdao and Wuhan. Wuhan is located in the centre of southern China and has a subtropical climate; 16, 17 while Qingdao is situated in the coastal area of northern China in the temperate zone, which has a relatively lower humidity than Wuhan. 18 Despite the difference in natural characteristics between the two cities, common respiratory pathogens circulate in Wuhan and Qingdao (including IFV-A, IFV-B, RSV, and ADV) have shown to be generally similar during the peak season of respiratory diseases in wintertime (from January to February). [19] [20] [21] [22] The incidence of coinfection in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan was rather low. Whereas in places with relatively low temperature like northern Qingdao, it is more common to find combined SARS-CoV-2 infection with other seasonal respiratory pathogens. It is not yet known whether this phenomenon also exists in other regions, leaving a gap for future studies.

Otherwise these COVID- 19 It is notable that there are several limitations of this study. Two critically ill patients and one patient who died in the end were excluded due to lack of aetiological data other than SARS-CoV-2. As of February 16, 2020, there were 60 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qingdao, however, we only analysed 30 non-severe cases whose complete aetiological and clinical information was available. The age of patients in Qingdao ranged from 1.5 years to 80 years; whereas patients in Wuhan were all adults as they were medical professional infected through work. Such age difference between the two groups might bring in bias to this study. We performed nucleic acid testing for the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while coinfection with other pathogens was detected by serological testing of antibodies. In spite of superior accuracy, PCR-based molecular testing using throat swabs requires more complicated techniques of laboratory personnel with prolonged reporting time, which may not be suitable for emerging cases of SARS-CoV-2. 28,29 Thus, we applied rapid testing of aetiological agents by IIF in collected acute phase serum to guide clinical decision making.

To test the reliability of serum specific IgM detection, we recruited a control group of normal people without clinical symptoms. The low infection rate in our control population suggested that our method was reliable in early and rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections.

For such interventions to be 17 contemplated they need to comprise drugs that are efficacious when given to adults and for which 18 extensive human safety data are available. Here we show that dramatic lifespan extension can be 19 achieved in C.elegans by targeting multiple, evolutionarily conserved ageing pathways using drugs 20 that are already in human use. By targeting multiple synergistic ageing pathways, we are able to slow 21 ageing rate, double lifespan and improves healthspan while minimize developmental and fitness trade-22
offs. Moreover, we established that there is no synergistic benefit in a daf-2 or daf-7 23 background, implying the involvement of the TGF and IGF pathways in this synergy. Employing 24 lipidomics and transcriptomics analysis we found lipid metabolism to be affected resulting in 25 increased monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and decrease membrane peroxidation index. Our best 26 drug combination showed a conserved lifespan extension in fruit flies. To the best of our knowledge, 27 this is the largest lifespan effect ever reported for any adult-onset drug treatment in C. elegans. This 28 drug-repurposing approach, using drugs already approved for humans to target multiple conserved 29 aging pathways simultaneously, could lead to interventions that prevent age-related diseases and 30 overall frailty in a rapidly ageing population.
3 Some of the most important findings in biogerontology are the evolutionarily conserved pathways that 34 regulate lifespan 1-6 . In model organisms, mutations affecting these pathways can often extend lifespan 35 by between 30% and 100% 7,8 . Combining different genetic mutations can result in synergistic lifespan 36 extension 9-11 . By contrast, the effect of pharmacological interventions are typically much weaker, even 37 when targeting the same pathways 2,12,13 , but this genetic synergy suggests a potential strategy for the 38 design of novel pharmacological interventions by simultaneously targeting multiple evolutionarily 39 conserved ageing pathways. To date there is little data on synergistic effects of pharmacological 40 interventions on lifespan 14 . Here we report an in vivo approach to design novel multi-drug ageing 41 interventions. We show how multi-drug interventions leverage pathway synergies to maximize effect 42 size, while minimizing side effects and detrimental developmental tradeoffs through targeting distinct 43 but interacting ageing pathways. Our ultimate aim was to design a purely pharmacological, adult-44 onset intervention with lifespan efficacy similar or better than those of canonical aging mutations did.
Due to the lack of generally accepted biological markers for ageing [15] [16] [17] , lifespan studies are currently 46 the only way to test the efficacy of ageing interventions 18 . We therefore developed our candidate drug 47 combinations in a short-lived model organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using our 48 approach, we identify two triple drug combinations that extend lifespan and healthspan to an extent 49 greater than any previously reported pharmacological intervention in C. elegans 13 . Our synergistic 50 drug combinations show effect sizes comparable to the classical ageing mutations while avoiding 51 most of the tradeoffs associated with them 19-21 . We find that these interventions actually increase some 52 markers of performance while slowing biological ageing rate. Moreover, we identified TGF as a key 53 contributor and required pathway in mediating these synergistic effects. We also find that worms 54 treated with synergistic drug combinations have higher MUFA:PUFA ratios and a decrease in 55 membrane lipid peroxidation index. Finally, we confirm that this synergistic effect is also present in 56 the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Table S1 ). We chose to target 75 AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), caloric restriction 76 (CR), C-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and mitohormesis/mitochondrial metabolism as primary 77 longevity regulatory pathways. For each pathway, we identified drugs and drug-like molecules 78 reported to extend lifespan in at least one common model organism (nematodes, fruit flies or mice).
We were interested in drugs that might eventually be tested in humans so we favored drugs with 80 reported efficacy in mammals or that are already approved for human use. Based on these criteria, we 81 initially selected eleven candidate drugs (Supplementary Table S1 ). We added allantoin to our study 82 based on a report showing lifespan effects in C. elegans and a transcriptional analysis suggesting that 83 its mode of action is unusually distinct from other compounds 22 Table   97 S3). While transcriptional analyses revealed significant overlap between affected genes, we also 98 identified sets of genes that were unique to each individual compound (Fig. 2a) . MET shows 99 significant overlap with the other drugs, having the smallest unique set. Almost all genes affected by 100 MET and PSORA were also affected by at least one other drug in the set (Fig. 2a) . ALLAN causes 101 fewer gene-expression changes overall than any of the other compounds, but 48% of the genes 102 affected by ALLAN are unique, that is, not affected by any of the other drugs, while only 17% of the 103 genes affected by MET are unique (Fig. 2a 
We then systematically determined the efficacy of all ten possible pairs out of the five candidate drugs 121 (Extended data Fig. 2a-i) . For these trials we define synergy based on the Higher Single Activity 122 (HSA) model 28 ; Drug combinations are considered synergistic if the combinatorial effect is 123 significantly larger than any of the combination's single drug effect at the same (ideal) concentrations 124 as in the combination. Using this definition, we identified two synergistic combinations out of the ten 125 pairs tested (Fig. 2c, 170 Several of the drugs tested have previously been reported to be CR mimetics 17,32-34 . We therefore 171 tested each synergistic combination and its constituent compounds in a C. elegans model of CR (eat-2 172 mutants). We found that only RIF among the single drug treatments further extended lifespan in eat-2 Table S3 ). First we explored the transcriptomics data for changes that 223 might affect lipid composition and found that synergistic drug combinations indeed resulted in a 224 significant up regulation of the C. elegans SREBP-1c homologsbp-1, a master transcription factor 225 controlling several lipogenic genes, and genes coding for ""desaturases"" responsible for MUFA 226 synthesis 38-40 (Fig. 4c ,e). We then employed an MS-based lipidomics assay to determine changes in 227 lipid compositions that might result from these drug treatments. Worms that were exposed to the 228 synergistic drug combinations have a significant rise in TAG reserves ( lifespan in the optimal (best) health category while nematodes exposed to the RIF+PSORA+ALLAN 253 and RAP+RIF+ALLAN spent 57% and 63%, respectively, of their already extended lifespan in 254 optimal health (Fig. 5d, Extended data 9c ). This means that their health span was significantly 255 extended both in absolute and relative terms. Indeed, more than half of the treated animals were still 256 in optimal health even after the last control animal had died (Fig. 5d, Extended data Fig. 9c ).
257 Surprisingly, animals treated with RAP+RIF+ALLAN and RIF+PSORA+ALLAN also performed 258 significantly better in the spontaneous movement assay than control animals at most ages. In fact, old 259 treated animals (day 18 of age) showed performance in this assay that was indistinguishable from 260 young (day 7) controls ( Fig. 5g) . Moreover, treated animals experienced improvements in resistance 261 to heat and oxidative stress (paraquat) assays, (Figure 5e The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/153205 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 limited detected tradeoffs, but also improved health span, increased stress resistance, and even 264 increased physical performance. Such observations raise the important question if these lifespan 265 benefits are due to an actual delay in biological ageing rate. The rate of ageing can be expressed as 266 mortality rate doubling time (MRDT). We determined MRDT of animals exposed to synergistic drug 267 combinations using Survcurv 53 , and found MRDT to be significantly longer in RIF+PSORA+ALLAN 268 treated animals compared to controls (MRDT of control = 3 days and RIF+PSORA+ALLAN = 3.7 269 days, P value < 0.0001). The initial mortality rate was significantly lower for both synergistic should be noted that cohort size of flies was smaller than for worms and that we did not re-optimize 294 drugs for the fly experiments. However, these data confirms that some of the detected synergies 295 appear to be evolutionary conserved.
By targeting multiple overlapping ageing and longevity-related pathways we succeeded in designing 299 synergistic pharmacological interventions that, even when only applied to animals from adult age, 300 more than doubled healthy lifespan in C. elegans. This effect size is comparable to that of the classical 301 ageing mutations and, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest reported for any adult-onset 302 pharmacological intervention 13 . However, unlike in ageing mutations we detect very limited 303 detrimental evolutionary or fitness tradeoffs associated with this lifespan extension by drug synergies 304 19 . In particular, we did not detect any decrease in oxygen consumption or total fecundity. The latter 305 result is consistent with a previous study showing benefits of an adult-onset intervention using 306 resveratrol without reduced fecundity 56 . These data suggest that there is significant post-9 controls (Fig. 5g) . Mortality analysis suggests that one synergistic drug treatment slows basic 311 biological ageing rate by ~20% (Extended data Fig. 10 ). To test for evolutionary conservation, we 312 determined lifespan benefits in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, confirming qualitative 313 conservation for two of the four synergistic drug combinations. Nematodes are evolutionarily more 314 distant from fruit flies than they are from mammals 57 , making mechanisms and pathways conserved 315 between flies and nematodes ancient, and tracing this synergy back to a common ancestor of all three 316 clades.
To explore the mechanism of these synergistic lifespan benefits, we carried out epistasis experiments 318 and transcriptomic analysis, finding that daf-2/daf-16 (IGF/FOXO) as well as the TGF pathway (daf-319 7) are involved in synergistic lifespan extension (Fig. 4j) 32.4 51.5 *** = P value < 0.0001, ** = P value < 0.001, * = P value < 0.05 Table S3 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/153205 doi: bioRxiv preprint Extended data Figure 9 Figure S9 Health span and tradeoffs supplementary for figure 3. a, Drug synergies extended reproductive period. 10 worms per condition. b, Heat shock stress, RIF+PSORA+ALLAN improves heat shock stress resistance both at young, day 4, worms and older, day 15, worms c, Health span scoring at different age.

For 8 compound treatments, all agar plates were prepared from the same batch of NGM agar and 9 treatment plates were supplemented with the respective compounds or vehicle as a control. 10
Fresh plates were prepared every week. The following worm strains were used: wild type N2, 11
eat-2 (DA1116), daf-2 (CB1370), daf-16 (CF1038), daf-7 (CB1372). The strain CB1372 was 12 provided by Takao Inoue. All the other strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis 13

vehicles were added to the bacteria (in addition to being added to NGM) just before seeding. 22 23
Determination of lifespan 24
For determination of C. elegans lifespan, nematodes were age synchronized by bleaching, 25 allowed to hatch and 150-200 young adult worms per condition were transferred to 3-5 35mm 26 culture plates. Worms were transferred to fresh plates every day until progeny production 27 ceased, and every two to three days afterwards, until all worms had died. The number of 28 worms that were alive was determined every day, and dead worms were removed from the 29 plate. Worms were considered dead when no touch-provoked movement was observed. 30
Animals that crawled off the plate, exhibited extruded internal organs or displayed an egg 31 laying defective with subsequent hatching of larvae inside the mother were censored. All 32 lifespan assays were blinded and repeated at least two times. Graph pad Prism 5.0 software 33 was used to calculate mean adult lifespan and to perform statistical analysis of significance 34 using the log-rank test (Mantel-Cox). 35 36
Compound identification and validation 37
Primary Screening: First, we identified well-characterized ageing regulatory pathways 38 (Extended data Table-1 ). Next, we identified drugs and drug-like molecules that are known to 39 target the selected pathways and to extend lifespan in a common ageing model organisms 40 (worm, fly or mice). Some compounds that had been reported to target known ageing 41 pathways and had not yet been experimentally validated as lifespan-extending were also 42
included. This approached culminated in the identification of 11 candidate drugs (Extended 43 data Table-1) . Primary efficacy was confirmed in terms of lifespan in C. elegans. Initial 44 screening of compounds for their effect on lifespan of wild type N2 nematodes were 45 conducted using standardized condition in the presence of antibiotics (200mg/ml 46 streptomycin). Of these 11 drugs and drug-like molecules, only five resulted in reproducible 47 lifespan extension in our lab (Fig. 1) . For those compounds that passed the primary screening, 48
dose-response assays were carried out to establish the ideal dose and maximum effect size. 49 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

For triple drug combinations, we test the 94 combined effects against the sum of the effects of the best pair out of the three drugs. 95 96 97
Mortality 98
We experimentally determined the mortality rate of one of our most powerful interventions, 99 RIF+PSORA+ALLAN, using a large cohort of over 1,000 worms per condition. Dead worms 100
were counted every day until all worms were dead. For RAP+RIF+ALLAN the combined 101 lifespan data was imported to Survcurv for mortality analysis and maximum lifespan 102 comparison 3,4 . We used the Gompertz survival model to determine the initial mortality rate 103 and mortality rate doubling time using the following equation Freshly prepared bacteria (OP50 E. coli) were spotted on 94 cm NGM agar plates on the 115 previous evening and allowed to dry. Synchronized, young adult worms were transferred to 116 fresh plates. For maintaining synchronized populations, FUdR was added to NGM media. 117
After two days of treatment with drug or vehicle adult worms were washed off the plates to 118 15 ml tubes and washed several times until a clear solution, that indicates bacteria is 119 completely removed, was obtained. Clean worm pellets were then frozen and used for RNA 120 extraction. Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNAeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 121
Germany) following the standard protocol. Afterwards, RNA was quantified photometrically 122
with NanoDrop 2000 and stored at -80 o C until use. The integrity of total RNA was measured 123
by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. For library preparation an amount of 2µg of total RNA per 124 sample was processed using Illumina's RNA Sample Prep Kit following the manufacturer's 125 instruction (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). All single drugs were processed together and 126 multiplexed onto one lane to minimize batch effect. The different drug combinations were 127 processed into two multiplexed lanes. In total, we ran three lanes in parallel with 20 samples 128 in each and we had untreated N2 controls in each lane. Libraries were sequenced using 129
Illumina HiSeq4000 sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in a paired end 130 read approach at a read length of 150 nucleotides. Sequence data was extracted in FastQ 131
format. The RNAseq reads from each sample were mapped to the reference C. elegans 132 transcriptome (WBcel235) with kallisto (v0.43.0) 5 using 100 bootstrap samples and sequence 133 based bias correction. The estimated counts were imported from kallisto to the R environment 134 (v3.3.2) and summarized to gene-level using the tximport package (v1.2.0) 6 . The DESeq2 135 package (v1.14.1) 7 was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in all our 136 analysis (correcting for batch effects, when applicable) for a significance threshold α of 0.05 137 after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing through Independent Hypothesis Weighting 138 (IHW package v1.2.0) 8 .

0bd443591b5e10934beef050b516afeca6b668fe,"Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on
Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the ""seed cases"" from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054×x1+2.3455×x2 (n = 44, R 2 = 0.9330, P<10 -7 ). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% -48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model. Big data has played and will continue playing an important role in public health.","December 1, 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China (Huang et al, 2020) , the overall confirmed cases in China had reached 78,959 by the end of February 27, 2020, and a total of 2,791 people had died of the disease.
COVID-19 had also spread to other 50 country with the confirmed cases and deaths were 4,696 and 67 respectively, by the end of February 27, 2020. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 epidemic as an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020.
To prevent further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, 31 Provinces in China Mainland had raised their public health response level to the highest state of emergency (level-1) by January 29, 2020. The Chinese government has implemented a series of large-scale public health interventions to control the epidemic, many of which have far exceeded what International Health Regulations required, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement. Wuhan had prohibited all transport in and out of the city as of 10:00 on January 23, 2020, this is maybe the largest quarantine/movement restriction in human history to prevent infectious disease spread (Tian et al, 2020) . Hundreds of millions Chinese residents, including 9 million Wuhan residents, have to reduce even stop their inter-city travel and intra-city activities due to these strict measures.
Due to Wuhan lock-down, Kucharski et al (2020) estimated that the median daily reproduction number had declined from 2.35 of January 16 to 1.05 of January 30, Tian et al. (2020) estimated that the dispersal of infection to other cities was deferred 2.91 days (CI: 2.54-3.29). However, Read et al (2020) suggested that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on February 4. Do these large-scale public health interventions really work well in China? Besides, hundreds of officials were fired or appointed rapidly according to their incompetent or outstanding performances during the epidemic. How to assess the efforts of different regions in China Mainland against COVID-19?
Here we present a simple yet effective model based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data to quantify the consequences and importance of Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland, and preliminarily assess the efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities during the epidemic.

Migration. The travelers were down 91.61% and 91.62%, compared to the same period last year (14 million) and the first 23d (14 million from January 1 to January 23, 2020), respectively (Fig.1) .

The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 Due to Stay At Home Movement, the mean intensity of intra-city activities for 316 cities was 2.61/d during January 24 to February 15, 2020 according to Baidu Migration. It was down 42.42% and 50.27% when compared to the same period last year (4.53/d) and the first 23d (5.25/d), respectively (Fig.3) .
Obviously, COVID-19 greatly reduced the human mobility of China Mainland.
We consider 44 regions in China Mainland which accept travelers from Wuhan, including 29 Provinces (Tibet was excluded since only one confirmed case was reported) and 15 prefecture-level cities in Hubei province. We noticed that the number of confirmed cases between non-Hubei and Hubei were closer in the early period. For example, the number of cumulative confirmed cases by the end of January 26 in Chongqing (non-Hubei) and
Xiaogan (Hubei) were 110 and 100, respectively. Their cumulative confirmed cases by the end of February 27, however, were 576 and 3,517, respectively. We surmise that this is partly because Xiaogan has received more infected cases from Wuhan than Chongqing since the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. This surmise was confirmed by Fig.4 . The proportion of travelers from Wuhan accepted by Hubei regions to the total travelers from Wuhan increased rapidly from 70% (before January 19) to 74% (January 20), even over 77% after January 26. So we concluded that the first key factor affecting the later (e.g. February 27) cumulative confirmed cases of each non-Wuhan region is the sum immigrants from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (few immigrants after January 27). These immigrants had higher infected probability but lower transmission .

The second key factor is the sum number of the infected immigrants from Wuhan before January 19. According to the recent report, there is a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection, comprising a mean about 5 day incubation period and a mean 5 day delay from symptom onset to detection of a case (Imai et al, 2020; Yang et al, 2020; Li et al, 2020) . So the second key factor can be represented with the number of cumulative confirmed cases by the end of January 29. These ""seed cases"" had higher transmission ability because the susceptible had no any protection measure. A simple regression model was established as follow.
y= 70.0916+0.0054×x1+2.3455×x2 (n = 44, R 2 = 0.9330, P<10 -7 )
Here, y is the number of cumulative confirmed cases by February 27 of each non-Wuhan region, x1 is the sum number of immigrants from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 of each non-Wuhan region, and x2 is the number of cumulative confirmed cases by January 29 of each non-Wuhan region.
The standard regression coefficients of x1 and x2 are 0.6620 and 0.3796 respectively, indicating that x1 is more important than x2 for determining y.

To evaluate the effect of Wuhan lock-down, x2, the number of cumulative confirmed cases by January 29, should be fixed. Then we assumed three different lock-down plans besides the real plan (Table 1) . I20  I21  I22  I22  I22  I22  I23  I24  I25  I26 Strict * : none left Wuhan since the date of lock-down. I20 ~ I29 are the real emigrants from January 20 to January 29, respectively.
It's not fair to assess the effort of different regions only based on the final number of cumulative confirmed cases due to the difference of the number of immigrants from Wuhan. The aforementioned interpretative model has taken this difference into account and the results are listed with 5 grade (Excellent, Good, Normal, Poor, Very poor) according to standard residuals (Table 2 and Table 3 ). We emphasize that this is only a preliminary evaluation and the results are for reference only.
The human mobility data on inter-city travel and intra-city activity from January 1, 2020 to February 21, 2020 (including the same period data in 2019) in China Mainland is from Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com).
The inter-city travel population of each city is represented with immigration and emigration index, the travelers proportions of different destination and departure, on the level of Province and city (but only the top 100 cities), are also listed.

Nanjing, Qingdao, Shenzhen and Foshan during the 2019 Spring Festival travel rush (40d) are from their Official website of the Transportation Commission. We estimate one Baidu Migration index is about equal to 56,137 travelers (Fig.6) .
The confirmed case data on each Province and prefecture-level city are from the National Health Commission of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml) and its affiliates.
Baidu Migration recorded more types of spatial displacement, including airplane, high-speed rail, ship, coach and private car, so it theoretically has higher accuracy. The real inter-city travel population of each city, however, is to the last day before lock-down (January 22) is 95.98, then the two model estimated travelers are 2.9 million and 5.4 million, respectively. News Release Conference of Wuhan on 26 January confirmed that more than 5 million people had left Wuhan after 10 January due to the Spring Festival travel rush and epidemic. Our estimated value is closer to official reports.
It is worth noting that the Baidu Migration index still has the following disadvantages for estimating real traveler population. 1) The mobility behavior of a large number of groups un-connected to Baidu Map and third-party .

For example, one user travel from A, pass through B and arrive final destination C, and the user also has location information in C by coincidence, then this trip will be disassembled into A-B and B-C. Regardless, big data has and will continue to play an important role in public health. There are 9.48 million residents in Wuhan around January 26, the cumulative confirmed cases are 2,261 by January 29. We estimate at least 56,916 people were infected in Wuhan according to our model (up to February 27 the confirmed cases are 48,137). In other words, more than 8,000 undetected but infected individuals still wait for checking out in the center of epidemic storm. Wuhan still has much to do.
SARS-CoV-2 has diversity transmission approaches, including respiratory (mouth foam) and contact routes which have been confirmed, as well as aerosol and digestive (fecal-oral) routes which cannot be ruled out (National Health Commission of China, 2020). It is also highly concealed according to the recent report of transmission of the virus from asymptomatic and mild individuals (Zhang et al, 2020; Sanche et al, 2020 Yang et al (2020) , respectively. At the beginning of the outbreak, the infected individuals may be greatly underestimated due to the asymptomatic transmissions, insufficient sensitivity of diagnostic reagents and delayed .

The latest estimated value of R0 and the control reproductive number is 4.7-6.6 (Steven et al, 2020) and 6.47 (CI: 5.71-7.23) (Tang et al, 2020), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, Wang et al (2020) projected that without any control measure the infected population would exceed 200,000 in Wuhan by the end of February. As for Steven et al (2020) and Read et al (2020) , the estimated number was 233,400 (CI: 38,757-778,278) by the end of January and 191, 529 (CI: 132, 649) by February 4, respectively. Up to February 27, the confirmed cases are 48,137.
The only lesson that humans have learned from history is that humans have not learned anything from history.
Clearly, Wuhan has not learned anything from the SARS epidemic in 2003, now she is suffering from her early delays. Fortunately, China Government has implemented a series of large-scale public health interventions to control the epidemic. In fact, many prevention and control measures taken by China, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, go far beyond the requirements for responding to emergencies, setting new benchmarks for epidemic prevention in other countries. The Chinese method has proven to be successful. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, and the simplest and most direct thing that can explain this is the data (Fig.7) .
The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is still rapidly growing and spread to more than 42 countries as of February 27, 2020.
At present, the most serious countries outside China are South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan. It is worrying that although some measures have been taken, the current prevention and control measures of these countries may still be insufficient. None of them has reached the level of prevention and control in China's moderately affecting .

0c27c0ddaa4761f6155838df81a88d24619720f8,"Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.","We are currently faced with a potential global epidemic of a new coronavirus that has infected thousands of people in China and is spreading rapidly around the world. This week the WHO has declared it an global emergency (WHO, 2020) . The Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has already caused more infections than the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002 and 2003. The virus is a SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), and it is genetically associated with SARSr-CoV strains that infect bats in China . It causes severe respiratory illness, has high fatality rate , can be transmitted from person to person and has spread to over 15 countries in less than two months (WHO, 2020) .
This coronavirus outbreak has been unprecedented; so too is the way that the scientific community has responded to it. They have openly and rapidly shared genomic and clinical data as never seen before allowing research results to be released almost instantaneously. This has helped the understanding of the transmission dynamics, the development of rapid diagnostic and has informed public health response. Here, we present a new contribution that can speed up this communal effort. The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool is a free-of-charge web-based bioinformatics pipeline that can accurately and quickly identify, assemble and classify coronaviruses genomes. The tool also identifies changes at nucleotides, coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner to allow tracking new viral mutations (Figure 1 ). To this reference dataset, we added 47 whole genomes of the current Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The 2019-nCoV sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org) together with annotation of its original location, collection date and originating and submitting laboratory. The 2019-nCoV data generators are properly acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of this paper and detailed information is provided in Supplementary Table 1. The 431 reference WGS were aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar 2004) . The alignment was manually edited until a codon alignment was attained in all coding sequences (CDS). A Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed in PhyML (Guidon & Gascuel 2003; Lemoine et al., 2018) and a Bayesian tree using MrBayes (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) were constructed. The trees were visualized in Figtree (Rambaut 2018). We selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster (with bootstrap support of 100% and posterior probability of 1). We identified five well supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of SARSr-CoV and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool. Cluster 1 included SARS strains from the 2002 and 2003 Asian outbreaks. In our tool, we named this cluster SARS-CoV Outbreak 2000s but may rename it as SARS-A if a new proposed naming system for SARSr-Cov is adopted in the near future (Rambaut 2020). Cluster 2 (provisionally named as SARS related CoV) includes 7 sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks. Cluster 3 (named as Bat SARS-CoV HKU3) includes three WGS sampled from Rhinolophus sinicus (i.e. Chinese rufous horseshoe bats). Cluster 4 (Bat SARS-CoV ZXC21/ZC45) includes two SARSr-CoV sampled from Rhinolophus sinicus bats in Zhoushan, China. Cluster 5 (provisionally named as Wuhan 2019-nCoV, which may be renamed as SARS-B) includes one public sequence from the outbreak in Wuhan, China. We identified this cluster with many sequences from GISAID but kept only this one as this is the only GenBank sequence, accession number MN908947, which was kindly shared by Prof. Yong-Zhen Zhang and colleagues in the virological.org website. Detailed information about the phylogenetic reference datasets are available in Supplementary Table 2. The phylogenetic reference dataset was used to create an automated Coronavirus Typing Tool using the Genome Detective framework (Vilsker et al., 2019 . To determine the accuracy of this tool, each of the 431 test WGS was considered for evaluation (i.e. 384 reference sequences from VIPR and 47 public 2019-nCoV sequences). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our method was calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of SARSr-CoV. Sensitivity was computed by the formula Classifying query sequences in an automated fashion involves two steps. The first step enables virus species assignments and the second, which is restricted to SARSr-CoV, includes phylogenetic analysis. The first classification analysis subjects a query sequence to BLAST and AGA analysi. AGA is a novel alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes from NCBI RefSeq Virus Database. AGA (Deforche 2017) expands the optimal alignment algorithms of Smith-Waterman (Smith & Waterman 1981) and Gotoh (Gotoh 1982) based on an induction state with additional parameters. The result is a more accurate aligner, as it takes into account both nucleotide and protein scores and identifies all of the polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels. In the second step, a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the MAFFT software (Katoh & Standley 2013) . In addition, a Neighbor Joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the HKY distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using PAUP* (Swofford) . The query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support >70%. If the bootstrap support is <70%, the genotype is reported to be unassigned.
The result of the phylogenetic and mutational analysis performed by AGA is available in a detailed report. This report contains an interactive phylogenetic tree and genome mapper (Supplementary Figure 1) . It also presents the virus species and cluster assignments and a detailed table that provides information about open reading frames (ORFs), CDS and proteins. This table can be expanded to show nucleotide and amino acid mutations that differentiate a query sequence from their species RefSeq or from a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset. All results can be exported to a variety of file formats (XML, CSV, Excel, Nexus or FASTA).
The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool correctly classified all of the 175 SARSr-CoV sequences at species level, i.e. specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of 100%. Furthermore, all of the 47 2019-nCoV WGS that were isolated in China (n=36), USA (n=5), France (n=2), Thailand (n=2), Japan (n=1) and Taiwan (n=1) were correctly classified at phylogenetic cluster level as 2019-nCoV, which may be renamed as SARS-B. In addition, we classified with very high specificity, sensitivity and accuracy (i.e. 100%) all of the 112 SARS outbreak WGS of 2002 and 2003. We also achieved perfect classification (i.e. specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of 100%) for all of Beta coronavirus, Human_coronavirus_HKU1, MERS-CoV, Rousettus_bat_coronavirus_HKU9 and Tylonycteris_bat_coronavirus_HKU4 at species level. For a detailed overview of assignment performance, please refer to the Supplementary Table 3. Our tool also allows detailed analysis of coding regions and proteins for each of the coronavirus species. For example, the analysis of the first released 2019-nCoV sequence, the WH_Human1_China_2019Dec (GenBank: MN908947) demonstrated at genome level , the nucleotide (NT) identity was 79.0% to the reference strain of SARSr-CoV (ACCESSION: NC_004718.3) and that the Envelop Small Membrane Protein (protein E) is the most similar protein. In total, 94.8% (73/77) of the amino acids were identical; the four amino acid differences were located at positions 55 (T55S), 56 (V56F), 69 (69deletion) and 70 (G70R). The spike protein (protein S), which can be associated with virulence, was 76.2% identical to the reference strain of SARSr-CoV (Supplementary Table 4A ). Interestingly there were four amino acid insertions at position 237 (A237_F238insHRSY, genome NT position 22202_22203insCATAGAAGTTAT)), which is just upstream from a cleavage site. The most diverse coding regions were the CDS Sars8a and Sars8b. In these two regions, only 30% of the amino acids were identical. Sars8b protein was truncated early and its CDS had four stop codons (Supplementary Table 4sA ).
Our Coronavirus Typing Tool also allows a query sequence to be analysed against a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset. For example, the WH_Human1_China_2019Dec (GenBank: MN908947) the identity was 87.5% to the Bat sequence bat_SL_CoVZXC21 (Genbank: MG772934). This was one of the Bat-CoV sequences that were most related to n2019-CoV . The Envelop Small Membrane Protein (protein E) was 100% identical (Supplementary  Table  4B ). When the 2019-nCoV isolated from France (BetaCoV/France/IDF0373/2020) was analysed with our tool and compared with the 2019-nCOv WH_Human1_China_2019Dec strain (Accession: MN908947), this sequence was 99.9% identical and had only two NT mutations (Supplementary Table 4C ). These two differences were located on positions: 22551G>T & 26016G>T), which caused three amino acid mutations (E2 glycoprotein Protein mutation: V354F (22551G>T) , sars3a protein mutations: G250V (26016G>T) and sars3b protein mutations: V110F (26016G>T)) (Detailed in Supplementary  Table 4C -II). The analysis of a WGS in FASTA format takes approximately 60 seconds.
We developed and released the Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing tool as a free-of-charge resource in the third week of January 2020 in order to help the rapid characterization of nCoV-2019 infections. This tool allows the analysis of whole or partial viral genomes within minutes. It accepts assembled genomes in FASTA format or raw NGS data in FASTQ format from Illumina, Ion Torrent, PACBIO or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) can be submitted to the Genome Detective Virus Tool (Vilsker et al., 2019) to automatically assemble the consensus genome prior to executing the Coronavirus Typing Tool. User effort is minimal, and a user can submit multiple FASTA sequences at once.
The tool uses a novel and dynamic aligner, AGA, to allow submitted sequences to be queried against reference genomes, using both nucleotide and amino acid similarity scores. This allows accurate identification of other coronavirus species and the tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally. It also performs detailed analysis of the coding regions and proteins. Moreover, it can easily be updated to add new phylogenetic clusters if new outbreaks arise or if the classification nomenclature changes. The tool has been able to correctly classify all the recently released nCoV-2019 genomes, as well as all the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak sequences
In conclusion, the Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool is a web-based and user-friendly software application that allows the identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes.",Title: Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool for rapid identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes Short title: Automated tool for phylogenetic and mutational analysis of coronaviruses genomes,biorxiv,10.1101/2020.01.31.928796,,,biorxiv,2020-02-02,"Cleemput, S.; Dumon, W.; Fonseca, V.; Abdool Karim, W.; Giovanetti, M.; Alcantara, L.

0cad40f50e41144e8b64744251515eca8cfac5f7,"In this paper, we estimate the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 based on Wallinga and Lipsitch framework [11] and a novel statistical time delay dynamic system. We use the observed data reported in CCDC's paper to estimate distribution of the generation interval of the infection and apply the simulation results from the time delay dynamic system as well as released data from CCDC to fit the growth rate. The conclusion is: Based our Fudan-CCDC model, the growth rate r of COVID-19 is almost in [0.30, 0.32] which is larger than the growth rate 0.1 estimated by CCDC [9], and the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 is estimated by 3.25 ≤ R 0 ≤ 3.4 if we simply use R = 1 + r * T c with T c = 7.5, which is bigger than that of SARS. Some evolutions and predictions are listed.","The serial interval distribution presented in the paper ""Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected peneumonia"" [9] by the researches in Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CCDC) et al, which is defined as the duration between symptom onset insuccessive cases in the transmission chain in Fig.2B of [9] . We assume that the distribution is Gamma distribution, i.e., the corresponding probability density function is
where the parameters are n = 5 and b = 2 3 . So the mean of the distribution is n b = 7.5 which is exactly equal to the number announced in [9] , where they claimed that the mean serial interval of COVID-19 is 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19). Besides the mean, comparison of (1.1) with Fig2B is more convince. The formula is so beautiful, that we believe it must be true. The other distributions are also given in our recent report [10] .
We think this distribution just as the one of generation interval mentioned in [11] . Now we can determine the reproductive number R 0 of COVID-19 if we know the growth rate r of COVID-19 by
where T c = 7.5 can be obtained from (1.1). Before we discuss how to get the estimate of the growth rate r of COVID-19, let us review the elegant framework by Wallinga and Lipsitch [11] .
According to the framework of Wallinga and Lipsitch [11] , in order to obtain the reproductive number R 0 , some variables and distributions should be known based on the data before we use their uniform framework:
• the growth rate of the epidemic r;
• the mean generation interval of the infection T c ;
• or the generation interval distribution of the infection g(t).
We just mention that the mean generation interval T c is the first moment of the generation interval distribution g(t):
If r and T c are computed, the value of the reproductive number R 0 can be simply estimated through a linear equation( [11, 1, 8, 4, 5] ):
And if r and g(t) are estimated, R 0 can be computed as
where M (z) is the moment generating function of the distribution g(t):
Wallinga and Lipstch's processes are simple but powerful, which clearly demonstrate how generation intervals shape the relationship between growth rate and reproductive number. Specially, if g(t) is Gamma distribution with parameters (b, n) as in [11] , then we can have two estimates of R 0 , one is by (2.2) R Γ,c = 1 + nr b , (2.5) and the another is by (2.3)
Based on the formula of the generation interval, we know that b = 2 3 and n = 5, R Γ,g will be too sensitive on r, and we will choose (1.2) to obtain R 0 , and our main focus is to get an accurate and stable estimate for the growth rate r. The modified second order approximation to (2.6) is also important and has been widely used [11, 6] .

In [11] , Wallinga and Lipsitch point out that if the epidemic model is assumed to be susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered(SEIR) model, then the generation interval distribution is Gamma distribution.
So we can obtain our first conclusion.
Conjecture 2.1. The epidemic model for COVID-19 is SEIR if CCDC's data are correct.
The above conclusion may be interpreted by that CCDC assumed that the epidemic model should be SEIR. Now we introduce how we can estimate the growth rate r.
Our group has developed some models for the growth rate of COVID-19 (TDD-NCP models [2, 13] and Fudan-CCDC models [10] ) after Jin suggested to use the time delay model to fit the real data [2] . Because of the outstanding agreement with data from CCDC and the estimations on the growth rate are very stable, we decide to use the following Fudan-CCDC model. Other models also work very well to fit the CCDC data.
Firstly, Let us introduce some variables:
• I(t): (the distribution of) the cumulative number of cases in the infected stage at time t;
• J(t): (the distribution of) the cumulative ones in hospitalization stage at time t;
• G(t): (the distribution of) the number of infected and isolated but yet diagnosed cases at time t. They are infected in fact, but are not confirmed by the hospital, then not appeared in the infected list of CCDC;
We further make some assumptions on the transition probability functions f 2 (t), f 3 (t) and f 4 (t):
• f 2 (t): the transition probability from infection to illness onset;
• f 3 (t): the transition probability from illness onset to hospitalization;
• f 4 (t): the transition probability from infection to hospitalization, which can be calculated via the convolution of f 2 (t) and f 3 (t).
We assume the log-normal distribution for f 2 (t) and the Weibull distrubution for f 3 (t) [10] , and the distribution parameters can be estimated from CCDC by fitting the figures in [9] . In particular, two important parameters are used:
• β: denotes the growth rate, which is exactly the same as r: β = r.
• : denotes the quarantine strategy, for example, specially, we consider this parameter as the isolation rate. Large value of suggests that the government more likes to control the spreading of COVID-19.

One can also use the discrete system with each step representing one day just as we have implemented in the code:
We will fit and estimate appropriate values of β(or r) and based on the cumulative diagnosed data from CCDC. Other versions of our Fudan-CCDC model are developing, specially, we are considering the stochastic version: that is to take random inputs into account, which is important to account for the influences from other regions. In math, we can easily generalize the model by random terms such as Brownian motion in the system, meanwhile the parameters have to be obtained from the real data. The another important version is to consider the interactions of two or more regions, Jin's group have developed some models based on TTD-NCP model [3, 7] . These models will also be developed in need of disease control and prevention. The simulation is implemented via Matlab with some additional constraints imposed. Here the results are summarized in Table 1 with the real data employed up to Feb 16, 2020. In the Table 1 , we use two kind of quarantine strategies introduced below. We are surprised that our code can get uniform estimators on the growth rate r and the reproductive number R 0 . Two quarantine strategy: We can observe that is distinct for different time stages at the different regions. Now we assume two quarantine strategies, one uses the following assumption:

We report the results in Table 2 . We also find that for the Diamond Princes Cruise Ship is β = 0.3182, 1 = 0, 2 = 0.3239. Moreover, the results from the model imply the case in the Diamond Princes Cruise Ship may be very DANGEROUS, since is below one key THRESHOLD, where the number of the infected persons will growth quickly. We also very worry about the situations in Japan. We WARN here that every CDC in every country should track the number of the infected persons, and immediately increase to one suitable level.

0cb9c296684ca5e71462d825cab2827854a01544,"Summary Statement: DUX4 is thought to mediate cytopathology through p53. Here, DUX4 is shown to kill primary myoblasts and promote pathological phenotypes in the iDUX4[2.7] mouse model on the p53-null background, calling into question this notion.
FSHD is a genetically dominant myopathy caused by mutations that cause expression of the normally silent DUX4 gene. This transcription factor has been shown to interfere with myogenesis when misexpressed at very low levels in myoblasts, and to cause cell death when overexpressed at high levels. A previous report using adeno-associated virus to deliver high levels of DUX4 to mouse skeletal muscle demonstrated severe pathology that was suppressed on a p53 knockout background, implying that DUX4 acted through the p53 pathway. Here, we investigate the p53-dependence of DUX4 using both in vitro cellular and the transgenic iDUX4[2.7] mouse models. We find that inhibiting p53 has no effect on the cytoxicity of DUX4 in vitro. When crossed onto the p53 null background, we find no suppression of the male-specific lethality or skin phenotypes of the DUX4 transgene, and find that primary myoblasts from this mouse are still killed by DUX4 expression. These data challenge the notion that the p53 pathway is central to the pathogenicity of DUX4.

The genetic mutation underlying FSHD is usually a reduction in the copy number of a macrosatellite repeat on chromosome 4 referred to as D4Z4 (van Deutekom et al. 1993; Wijmenga et al. 1992 ). This repeat is GC-rich, highly methylated, and normally subjected to repeat-induced silencing, which is disrupted in an allelespecific manner by contractions to 10 or fewer copies (van Overveld et al. 2003) or on all D4Z4 repeats by mutation in the chromatin protein SMCHD1 (de Greef et al. 2009; Hartweck et al. 2013 ; Lemmers et al. 2012) . When silencing at D4Z4 breaks down, an RNA transcript encoding the DUX4 protein (Gabriels et al. 1999 ) is expressed. The presence of a poly(A) signal downstream of the D4Z4 repeats on chr4 (Dixit et al. 2007 ) leads to DUX4 expression and explains why disease is associated only with contractions of the D4Z4 repeats on chr4, and only on specific 4qter alleles, so called permissive alleles, which harbor the poly(A) signal (Lemmers et al. 2010; Lemmers et al. 2004 ). The DUX4 protein has been observed by immunostaining of cultured FSHD myoblasts which show infrequent, possibly episodic, expression (Jones et al. 2012; Snider et al. 2010 ) and differentiated myotubes which show more prevalent expression (Block et al. 2013; Rickard, Petek and Miller 2015) .
Mechanisms of DUX4-mediated pathology are currently being investigated actively. At high levels of expression, DUX4 causes toxicity that leads to cell death of myoblasts (Bosnakovski et al. 2008; Kowaljow et al. 2007 ), while at low levels of expression, it impairs myogenic differentiation (Dandapat et al. 2014) and sensitizes cells to oxidative stress (Bosnakovski et al. 2008 ). A mouse model allowing doxycycline-regulated DUX4 expression has recapitulated these phenotypes in primary myoblasts (Dandapat et al. 2014) while also having several nonmuscle related phenotypes due to low basal levels of DUX4 expression in the absence of All rights reserved.

Other animal model work includes a mouse carrying human D4Z4 repeats (Krom et al. 2013) which showed some evidence of sporadic DUX4 expression, but no myopathy; and adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated delivery of DUX4 to skeletal muscle, which showed profound myopathy (Wallace et al. 2011 ). This latter work implicated the p53 pathway in DUX4 pathology, as the p53 knockout background suppressed AAV-DUX4 toxicity. The linkage to p53 is compelling, as this pathway has the potential to push cells into apoptosis, however precisely how DUX4 would activate p53 is not clear. The immediate targets of the DUX4 transcription factor include genes with regulatory elements containing the sequence TAATCTAATCA (Geng et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2015) , or variants thereof. ChIP-seq has identified many genomic targets (Choi et al. 2016; Geng et al. 2012 ) and at the majority of these, DUX4 displaces nucleosomes, recruits p300 and/or CBP through its C-terminus which promotes acetylation of histone H3 and activation of transcription (Choi et al. 2016 ).
Here, we directly test the p53-dependence of the pathogenic phenotypes of DUX4 expression, by inhibiting p53 in cell lines while DUX4 is expressed, and by crossing the iDUX4[2.7] transgene onto the p53 knockout background. These experiments reveal that p53 is not necessary for DUX4-mediated pathology, neither in myoblasts, nor in other tissues.
Previously, overexpression of Pax3 or Pax7 was been shown to reduce the toxicity of DUX4 to C2C12 mouse myoblasts (Bosnakovski et al. 2008) . To see to what extent inhibiting p53 could similarly reduce DUX4 toxicity, we transduced iC2C12-DUX4 cells, which are immortalized mouse myoblasts engineered for doxycycline-inducible DUX4 expression, with retroviral vectors expressing several constructs known to interfere with p53: a dominant negative p53 (R175H All rights reserved.

Overexpressing cell lines were established and cells were exposed to two different doses of doxycycline, both of which resulted in significant cell killing in the absence of overexpression (empty vector control).
Notably, although the positive controls, Pax3 and Pax7, protected substantially at 24 hours, cells transduced with the three p53 inhibitors did not show a reduced death rate compared to empty vector (Fig. 1 ). This indicates that in this system, p53 is not a relevant player in the cell death phenotype.
We have previously generated a mouse model with a doxycycline-inducible 2.7 kb DUX4 transgene (Dandapat et al. 2014; Dandapat et al. 2016) , referred to as iDUX4[2.7]. One of the interesting features of this mouse is that the very low basal level of expression from the Tet-on promoter in the absence of doxycycline leads to various non-muscle phenotypes, especially in males, where 80% die as embryos, with the remaining 20% being severely runted and all dying before 6 weeks of age. Females are less severely affected and can thus propagate the strainbecause the transgene is X-linked, X-inactivation diminishes the phenotype in females. We reasoned that if p53 were necessary for the pathological effects of DUX4 on embryonic cell types, then on a p53 knockout background, males ought to be born at normal ratios, and ought to be relatively healthy compared to siblings with a functional copy of p53. We therefore crossed the iDUX4[2.7] transgene onto the p53 knockout background. Female carriers were obtained that were homozygous for the p53 knockout and these were bred to male p53 heterozygotes. We genotyped 65 progeny from this backcross and obtained no DUX4+ males, neither on the p53 knockout nor on the heterozygous background (Fig. 2) . Thus, absence of p53 has no effect on the pathological effects of DUX4 on development in the iDUX4[2.7] strain.
Although no males were produced from the backcross described above, we did eventually obtain live born p53 iDUX4[2.7] knockout males from F1 crosses to Rosa-rtTA p53 double All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Thus p53 is not necessary for the pathological effects of DUX4 on non-muscle tissues.
To determine whether DUX4 would be cytotoxic to muscle cells in the absence of p53, we established primary cell cultures from muscle tissue of these iDUX4[2.7] ; p53 KO animals.
Primary muscle cells were sorted into myogenic and fibro-adipogenic fractions by flow cytometry for VCAM/Itga7 and PDGFRα, respectively. These sorted primary cultures were then exposed to doxycycline over a series of doses to induce DUX4 expression to different levels. DUX4 expression was clearly cytopathic (Fig. 3A) and caused a dose-dependent loss of cellular viability in myoblasts (Fig. 3B) . The same was observed for fibroadipogenic progenitors (Fig.   3B ) on the p53 knockout background. Thus, in the absence of p53, DUX4 is still cytotoxic, to both myogenic and fibroadipogenic progenitors.
Using both the inducible C2C12 cell culture system, where it was originally demonstrated that DUX4 was pathogenic to myogenic progenitors (Bosnakovski et al. 2008) , and the iDUX4[2.7] mouse model (Dandapat et al. 2014 ), we find no evidence for p53 involvement in DUX4 pathogenicity. Interestingly, this applies to phenotypes caused by very low basal levels of DUX4 expression, as the developmental effects and runting are thought to be, as well as overt cytotoxicity in primary or immortalized cells, which is the result of high level DUX4 expression.
The previous study implicating p53 in DUX4 toxicity made use of a very different experimental system with vastly higher levels of DUX4 expression: recombinant adeno-associated virus vector-mediated production. The levels of DUX4 expression achieved in a cell infected with multiple copies of DUX4 driven from the CMV promoter are much higher than those in which DUX4 is expressed from its endogenous promoter from a single (terminal) D4Z4 repeat in All rights reserved.

It is possible that at these exceptionally high levels of expression, the p53 pathway does in fact become necessary for some aspect of extreme pathology, however the relevance of such high levels of expression is debatable. The nature of the muscle damage seen in the AAV model is quite distinct from that seen in FSHD, and DUX4 expression is in fact quite difficult to detect in biopsies of FSHD muscle, to the point where the most reliable readout of its expression in biopsies is its target gene fingerprint (Yao et al. 2014 ). It is also theoretically possible that some aspect of the AAV experimental system combines with the effect of DUX4 to make the pathology more severe than it would otherwise have been, and the p53 effect ascribed to DUX4 was in fact downstream of the cellular response to AAV infection.
Nevertheless, the studies presented here clearly demonstrate that p53 is not necessary for cytotoxicity of DUX4.
Animal work was conducted under a protocol approved by the University of Minnesota IACUC.
The p53 mutant allele used in these studies was obtained from Jackson Labs (strain 008651) and carries a floxed stop codon upstream of a dominant negative (R270H) p53 mutant. In the absence of cre, no functional p53 is produced, thus as used in the current study, it is a null allele. Mice homozygous for this allele developed papillomas and most eventually succumbed to thymic lymphomas, as predicted for a p53 null.

COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2.

We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic. (7, 8) .
The -1 PRF signal can be broken down into three discrete parts: the ""slippery site"", a linker region, and a downstream stimulatory region of mRNA secondary structure, typically an mRNA suggesting that it may present a target for small molecule therapeutics (7, 8) . In addition, the presence of a hairpin located immediately 5' of the slippery site has been reported to regulate -1 PRF by attenuating its activity (14) . Here, we report on the -1 PRF signal from SARS-CoV2.
The core -1 PRF signal is nearly identical to the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signal, containing only a single nucleotide difference, a C to A. This change maps to a loop region in the molecule that is not predicted to impact on the structure of the three-stemmed pseudoknot. The attenuator hairpin appears to be less-well conserved.
However, functional analyses reveal that both elements promote nearly identical rates of -1 PRF, suggesting that this element has been structurally and functionally conserved.

Comparative structural analyses of the two -1 PRF signals. The core of the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signal begins with the U UUA AAC slippery site. This is followed by a 6 nt spacer region, which is then followed by the three- revealed that the sequence of the attenuator hairpin was less well conserved than the frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot (Fig. 1B) .
The structure of the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signal was previously determined to include a threestemmed mRNA pseudoknot (11) . Using this as a guide, the single C to A base difference between the core SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF signals maps to a loop that is not predicted to alter the structure of the -1 PRF stimulating element (7) (Fig. 1C) . In contrast, the attenuator hairpin contains six differences in the nucleotide sequence between the two viruses, and the SARS-CoV-2 element is predicted to be less stable than its SARS-CoV counterpart (Fig. 1D) . This suggests that the attenuation activity of this element is not as important as the ability to direct -1 PRF per se.
Comparative functional analyses of the two -1 PRF signals. Standard dual-luciferase assays were used to monitor -1 PRF activities of the two -1 PRF signals (15, 16) in HEK and HeLa cells. For both of the elements, -1 PRF activity was ~20% in HEK ( Fig. 2A) and ~30% in HeLa (Fig. 2B) . Amino acid sequence silent coding mutation of the U UUA AAC slippery sites to C CUC AAC (the incoming 0-frame codons are indicated by spaces) ablated -1 PRF activity in both cases, to less than 1% (Fig. 2) . These findings support the hypothesis that structure and function of the -1 PRF signals has been conserved between the two viruses.
Unfortunately, the dual luciferase reporter pJD2359 which was used to generate the other reporters used in this study does not contain the attenuator sequence. Thus, differences in this element were not able to be assayed.
Mutations that alter rates of - AAC) -1 PRF signals were assayed in HEK cells using dual-luciferase assays as previously described (15, 16) . Assays were performed as three technical replicates, and were repeated a minimum three times apiece (biological replicates). A. Assays performed in HEK cells. B. Assays performed in HeLa cells.

0d7964c665ff0107c674bc6dab8f252cab08038e,"Honey bees are eusocial insects, living in a colony that is often described as a superorganism. RNA mobility among cells of an organism has been documented in plants and animals. Here we show that RNA spreads further in honey bees, and is horizontally transferred between individuals and across generations. We found that honey bees share biologically active RNA through secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. Such RNA initiates RNA interference, which is a known defense mechanism against viral infection. Furthermore, we characterized diverse RNA profiles of worker and royal jelly, including fragmented viral RNA. Our findings demonstrate a transmissible RNA pathway with potential roles in social immunity and epigenetic signaling among members of the hive.
One of the characteristics of RNA interference (RNAi) is systemic spread of the silencing signal among cells and tissues throughout the organism. Systemic RNAi, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion, has been reported in diverse invertebrates, including honey bees, demonstrating environmental RNA uptake that undermines homologous gene expression. However, the question why any organism would take up RNA from the environment has remained largely unanswered. Here, we report on horizontal RNA flow among honey bees mediated by secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jelly diets. We show that ingested dsRNA spreads through the bee's hemolymph associated with a protein complex. The systemic dsRNA is secreted with the jelly and delivered to larvae via ingestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transmission of jelly-secreted dsRNA to larvae is biologically active and triggers gene knockdown that lasts into adulthood. Finally, RNA extracted from worker and royal jellies harbor differential naturally occurring RNA populations. Some of these RNAs corresponded to honey bee protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNA as well as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These results reveal an inherent property of honey bees to share RNA among individuals and generations. Thus, our findings suggest a transmissible RNA pathway, playing a role in social immunity and epigenetic signaling between honey bees and potentially among other closely interacting organisms.","In eukaryotes, sequence-specific gene silencing pathways, generally termed RNA interference (RNAi), are induced and maintained by the presence of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) [1] . Through processing of based-paired RNA into small RNAs, these mechanisms regulate gene expression in both co-transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels [2] . While RNA-mediated nascent transcript destabilization and heterochromatin remodeling inhibits gene transcription, post-transcriptional gene silencing down regulates gene expression through guiding target RNA degradation or repression of translation [3, 4] .
RNAi could be divided into cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous [5] . In cell-autonomous RNAi, silencing is restricted to cells that produce or were exposed to the dsRNA trigger. Initiation of local RNAi could develop in some organisms into a non-cell autonomous silencing signal, affecting cells and tissues which originally did not generate or were not introduced to dsRNA [6, 7] . The mechanisms that facilitate RNA export from donor cells, extracellular spread and import into acceptor cells are not fully elucidated, but under ongoing investigation in diverse biological systems.
In 1998, Timmons and Fire were the first to report on gene silencing triggered by environmentally acquired dsRNA [8] . In essence, their finding represents a form of horizontal regulatory RNA transfer. To date, susceptibility to environmental RNAi has been established in fungus and animals from different phyla including Nematodes, Plathelminthes and Arthropods [reviewed in [9] ]. Environmental RNAi experiments mostly utilize bacterially expressed-or in vitro synthesized dsRNA through ingestion, suggesting that dietary consumption is an effective RNA uptake pathway. Further supporting this, potent RNAi transmission from transgenic dsRNA-expressing plants to invertebrate herbivores has been widely reported [10, 11] . Accordingly, host to-parasite RNAi transfer (commonly termed ""host-induced gene silencing""; HIGS) has been applied to agriculture in recent years, demonstrating a potential practical strategy to control various pest and viral related diseases [12, 13] .
One of the main questions in the field of environmental RNAi is whether natural and functional RNA transfer among organisms occurs. Recently, transmission of parasitic nematode-derived miRNA to its mammalian host has been shown to compromise immunity of infected mice [14] . Similarly, pathogenic fungi exploit mobile small RNA signals to modulate via RNAi plant immune responses [15] . Reciprocally, arabidopsis plants secrete and transfer vesicles-containing small RNAs that could suppress virulence fungal genes [16] . Furthermore, ingestion of pollen-derived plant miRNA induces worker bee sterility in a sequence specific manner [17] . Interestingly, while the aforementioned examples provide evidence that some organisms acquire, and are affected by foreign regulatory RNA, it is still puzzling why would they allow it? This evolutionary maintained susceptibility to non-self regulatory RNA is intriguing in light of the fact that the most well-known transmissible RNA are viruses.
The honey bee (Apis mellifera) has been established as a model to study various disciplines in biology. One of the remarkable characteristics of honey bees is their environmentally-mediated phenotypic plasticity [18] . Female bee larvae can either develop into worker or queen; two castes with distinct morphology, physiology, reproductive capability, life span and behavior. This developmental flexibility of genetically identical individuals is driven by differential diet consumption. A larva fed exclusively on royal jelly will develop into a queen, whereas larva fed on worker jelly will develop into a worker [19] . In other words, nutritional differences trigger one genome to direct two distinct phenotypic outputs in honey bees.
The honey bee caste determination is driven by the interplay of food quantity and quality, environmental conditions and gene expression [20, 21] . Epigenetic regulation has been suggested to play a role in the honey bee's clonal phenotypic variation. Knockdown of DNA methyl-transferase 3 (dnmt3), a key enzyme in DNA methylation process, has a royal jelly-like effect, and semi-queen workers emerge with fully developed ovaries and a transcriptome profile similar to naturally reared queens [22] . Moreover, the methylation imprint varies between the brain's DNA of workers and queens, demonstrating unique epigenetic profiles among workers and queens [23] . Consistently, (E)-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10HDA), a fatty acid that comprises up to 5% of the royal jelly, has been characterized as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) [24] . Nonetheless, although the general involvement of epigenetics has been established, it is still not clear how caste-specific DNA methylation marking is directed.
Previously, we reported on a RNAi-based ingestion system for the control of Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) disease in honey bees [25] . Field trials, in which this environmental RNAi system was employed, indicated that the colony performance of virus-inoculated hives deteriorated following virus infection in control hives, whereas that of dsRNA-treated hives remained strong [26] . Interestingly, dsRNA-treated hives also produced more honey, when the main honey flow was 3-4 months after the last dsRNA treatment. By that time, most of the originally treated bees would have been replaced by new generations. Honey bee viruses can be transmitted among individuals in the hive both horizontally and vertically [27] . It was therefore expected that hives would become virus-affected once the new generation gradually replaced the previous, dsRNA-treated one. Potential persistence of disease protection raised the question whether treated honey bees may serve as vectors for RNA.
Following this hypothesis, here we show that environmentally consumed dsRNA in honey bees is up-taken from the digestive system and systemically spread through the hemolymph associated with a protein complex. Then, these RNAi carrier bees transfer silencing-triggering molecules to the next generation via dsRNA secretion into the jelly. Moreover, we demonstrate that jelly-secreted dsRNA is biologically active and triggers a long lasting silencing effect in the recipient generation. Finally, we characterize diverse naturally occurring endogenous and exogenous RNA populations in royal and worker jellies. These findings demonstrate an environmentally mediated transmissible RNA in honey bees.
Adult honey bees exchange food via trophallaxis and all bees in a hive are regarded as having a ""shared stomach"" [18] . Consumed but pre-digested dsRNA may thus be distributed directly among adult bees. However, nurse honey bees nourish the young larvae for the first three days with a processed diet secreted from the mandibular and hypopharyngeal food glands, the worker and royal jellies [19] . Queens are exclusively fed on royal jelly their entire life. In order to transmit RNAi-triggering molecules to the next generation, the ingested dsRNA has to spread systemically and reach the food glands, and then be secreted in the jellies. Therefore, we first attempted to test whether ingested dsRNA occurs in the honey bee's circulatory system, where it can systemically spread. To that end, we applied Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled dsRNA (dsRNA*) for the direct detection of ingested dsRNA.
Adult worker bees were immobilized and fed on dsRNA* or mock solutions directly to their glossa in order to avoid cuticle contamination. Five hours post feeding, we extracted hemolymph of bees and tested for the presence of dsRNA* in whole raw hemolymph extracts. A labeled band corresponding to the purified dsRNA* size (430bp) was detected in the hemolymph of treated bees ( Figure 1A) , demonstrating uptake of full length dsRNA from the digestive system to the circulatory system.
Interestingly, two additional dsRNA* bands of higher molecular weight (corresponding approximately to 2.5 and 4 Kbp) were also observed in raw hemolymph extracts ( Figure 1A ). Two scenarios can be drawn to explain the appearance of high molecular weight labeled RNAs: (i) recombination between dsRNA* and other RNAs; or (ii) association of the dsRNA* with other components of the hemolymph. Following Proteinase K digestion of the hemolymph extract the size of the higher bands shifted back to the expected 430 bp, indicating that the higher compounds were complexes of ca. full length dsRNA and hemolymph protein(s) ( Figure 1B ). It is worth noting that no processed dsRNA forms could be detected in the hemolymph extracts tested.
The honey bee's hemolymph is a complex fluid mixture of immune cells (haemocytes), lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, hormones and proteins [28] . The finding of ingested dsRNA-protein complexes in the hemolymph indicates a possible active mechanism for uptake and translocation of dsRNA through the honey bee's circulatory system and possible spread to the jelly producing glands. If this happens, mobile dsRNA may be present in the jelly. Therefore, we next tested whether ingested dsRNA is secreted in the diet of worker-and queen-destined larvae.
Minihives with ca. 250 worker bees and reproductive queens were established and fed on sucrose only (control) or sucrose solution mixed with dsRNA carrying a foreign GFP sequence (dsRNA-GFP). Control and treated hives were kept in separate net houses. Worker jelly was collected from brood cells containing 5 th instar worker larvae and royal jelly was harvested from queen brood cells with 3 rd -4 th instar larvae (see Materials and Methods). We could detect the presence of dsRNA-GFP by Northern blot analysis performed on total RNA extracted from worker and royal jellies. Notably, while the full-length dsRNA could be detected, additional degraded or processed GFP-RNA forms appear in both jellies ( Figure 1C ).
The presence of ingested dsRNA in the circulatory system indicates systemic spread and the possibility of dsRNA transport to the food glands ( Figure 1A, B) . This was further supported by dsRNA presence in both worker and royal jellies ( Figure 1C ). Hence, dsRNA could presumably be transmitted from nurse bees to the young larvae through jelly consumption.
In order to test whether RNA can be transferred horizontally among bee generations down the line, we established reproductive mini-hives that were fed on sucrose solution (control hives) or sucrose solution containing dsRNA-GFP (See Material and Methods). During the experiment, adult workers, larvae, pupae and newly emerged bees were collected and analyzed for the presence of dsRNA-GFP. The experimental design is illustrated in figure 2A . RNA slot-blot assay with a GFP-specific probe was conducted and showed, as expected, the presence of dsRNA-GFP in adult workers that consumed directly dsRNA in their diet. It also demonstrated the occurrence of dsRNA-GFP in larvae that consumed jelly secreted by treated bees ( Figure 2B ). As previously reported, dsRNA is stable and persists in treated adult bees for a few days post feeding [25] . Here we show that dsRNA, which is transmitted from nurse bees to the larvae, persists in subsequent developmental stages including pupae and newly emerging bees. It appears that ingested foreign dsRNA diminished with time, but could be detected at least 14 days after the last dsRNA feed ( Figure 2B ).
While the presence of dsRNA-GFP in the jellies supports horizontal transfer to the progeny, it might also be explained by vertical dsRNA transmission from queen toegg. To distinguish between the two possible transmission routes, we designed an experiment in which only horizontal nurse bee to-larvae transmission could occur (experimental design is illustrated in Figure 2C ). A similar mini-hives set up was established and sucrose solution containing dsRNA-GFP or sucrose solution only (control hives) were provided for five days. On day six, combs containing 1 st instar larvae from control hives were transferred either to dsRNA-treated or to another control hive. The transferred larvae were then allowed to develop four additional days in the new untreated-or dsRNA-treated host colonies. On day ten, the 5 th instar larvae were collected from the transferred combs, washed rigorously and analysed for the presence of dsRNA-GFP. Northern blot analysis performed on total RNA detected a GFP-RNA signal in larvae that were nourished by dsRNA-treated bees, demonstrating an environmentally mediated horizontal RNA transfer route among honey bee generations ( Figure 2D ).
RNA transfer from nurse bee to larvae does not rule out paternal queen deposition of RNA to eggs and its persistence throughout the progeny development. Therefore, we attempted exploring whether vertical dsRNA transmission also occurs in honey bees (experimental design is illustrated in Figure 2E ). To this end, the reproductive mini-hive system was applied and dsRNA-GFP containing sucrose solution or sucrose only solution (control hive) were provided for six days. On day six, simultaneous queen swaps among treatments were performed as follows: i) the queen from dsRNA-GFP hive replaced the queen from a control hive; and ii) the substituted control queen replaced a queen from a different control hive. On day eight, after two days of acclimatization, the newly introduced queens were released and allowed to lay eggs in their new colony. On day ten, eggs were collected, pooled and analyzed for the presence of dsRNA-GFP. We could not detect GFP-RNA signal in eggs laid by a queen that was previously nourished with royal jelly provided by dsRNA-treated bees ( Figure  1C ). We acknowledge that such negative detection could be explained by the sensitivity limitation of the Northern blot assay. Thus, we conclude that while vertical transmission might occur to some extent, horizontal nurse to-larvae transfer is the main route to distribute RNA among honey bees.
We next asked whether horizontally transferred RNA (i.e. transmissible RNA) is biologically active within recipient individuals. It has been previously demonstrated that supplementing dsRNA into the natural larval diet induces potent RNAi against endogenous RNA [29, 30] . Moreover, similar application with dsRNA, corresponding to Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) and Sacbrood Virus (SBV), effectively reduced viral RNA titter as well as disease symptoms in infected worker larvae and adults [31, 32] . Notably, these studies showed that ingestion of jelly-containing dsRNA results in sustainable gene silencing that lasts until adulthood [29] [30] [31] .
Unlike previous reports, we examined whether dsRNA, which is originated from nurse bees and secreted into the jelly, could elicit RNAi response in the progeny. To answer this question, we established a minimal hive system in plastic boxes containing ca. 150 workers and a comb with eggs and young larvae. The adult bees were fed for eight days on sucrose solution (untreated), sucrose solution mixed with dsRNA-GFP (non-specific dsRNA control) or dsRNA that matched the vitellogenin mRNA sequence (dsRNA-Vg). When the brood cells were sealed, the adult bees were removed and the combs were kept until new workers emerged. We then collected ten days old workers and analyzed the expression levels of vitellogenin by RT-qPCR. Consistent with persistence of jelly-transmitted dsRNA ( Figure 2B ) and in agreement with the aforementioned reports [29] [30] [31] , we observed vitellogenin knockdown in adult workers that were nourished as larvae by dsRNA-fed nurse bees ( Figure 2F ). Therefore, we concluded that transmissible RNA, at least in a dsRNA form, is biologically active in recipient bees.
Royal jelly is a processed food substance secreted from the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of young nurse bees. It is mainly composed of proteins, sugars, lipids, vitamins and free amino acids [33] . While queens are exclusively fed on royal jelly, worker larvae consume it only during the first three days post hatching, and then their diet is switched towards worker jelly (mixture of jelly, honey and pollen) [20] .
The previous experiments described a mechanism that enables, through jelly consumption, transmission of biologically active RNA among individuals within and between generations in the hive. These findings suggest a naturally occurring transmissible RNA pathway in honey bees. In line with this hypothesis, it has been reported that both worker and royal jellies contain small honey bee RNA populations, demonstrating endogenous bee RNA secretion into the larval diet [17, 30] . To further explore the RNA repertoire in the jellies, including the natural occurrence of exogenous and pathogen-related RNA, we adapted a small RNA-seq protocol to sequence fulllength RNA up to 200nt (see materials and methods). Samples of royal jelly were collected from 3 rd instar queen larvae brood cells, and worker jelly was collected from 5 th instar worker larvae brood cells. The jellies were harvested from untreated healthy looking hives.
Size distribution analysis of sequenced RNA indicated that worker and royal jellies have different profiles, with RNAs corresponding to 39-and 72 nt mainly differentiate among the two jellies ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Figure 1A) . We next applied a metagenomics analysis to identify the origin of jelly RNA and again, found different profiles in the worker and royal jellies ( Figure 3B , Supplementary Figure 1B) . Surprisingly, bee RNA represents only a minor fraction in both jellies, representing 0.58% and 3.55% of worker and royal jelly, respectively. Instead, large proportions of plant, fungi and bacteria were identified alongside sequences originating from unknown sources. Remarkably, RNA corresponding to various exogenous bee-affecting viruses could also be detected in both jellies.
We next further characterized jelly RNA that corresponds to the honey bee genome ( Figure 4A , Supplementary Figure 2A -C). Like the previous jelly RNA analyses, different honey bee RNA profiles were detected in worker and royal jellies. In both jellies the large proportions represent bee RNA homologous to protein coding genes followed by tRNAs. However, worker jelly is relatively enriched in ribosomal, transposable elements (TE) and non-coding RNA. Interestingly, differential TE RNA occurrence could be detected among the jellies, which is mainly associated with LTRretrotransposons and TIR transposons ( Figure 4B ).
We hypothesized that bees treated with an IAPV-specific dsRNA in previous field trials [26] , may have transmitted the antiviral RNA to other bees, resulting in transmissible protection against the viral infection. The presence of naturally occurring viral RNA in both jellies supports the existence of such an RNA-based social immunity in bees. Therefore, we also characterized the viral RNA in worker and royal jellies.
Overall, RNA corresponding to four and ten bee-affecting viruses could be detected in worker and royal jelly respectively ( Figure 5A ). The most abundant viruses in both jellies were DWV and Varroa Destructor Virus 1 (VDV-1). Interestingly, both sense and antisense viral RNA strands are detected for most viruses. The presence of replicative forms (anti-sense viral genome) suggests an intracellular origin of the viral RNA and its secretion into the jelly rather than RNA derived exclusively from environmental capsids. Additionally, we analyzed the size distribution of viral sequences and identified diverse sense and anti-sense viral RNA fragments in both jellies ( Figure 5B ). Interestingly, while both worker and royal jellies contain large populations of small RNAs ( Figure 3A) , almost no small viral RNAs (20-25nt) were identified ( Figure 5B ). To assess fragment diversity as well as potential occurrence of base-paired viral RNA, reads were mapped against corresponding viral genomes ( Figure 
Employing dsRNA as a model, this study reports on an environmentally mediated RNA cycle among honey bees. The cycle is engaged by consumption of RNA-containing diet by an individual bee. Then, the ingested RNA is spread from the digestive system through the epithelial gut cells to the hemolymph, where it is associated with a protein complex. A systemic RNA signal reaches the food secretion glands of nurse bees, and is transmitted to the progeny, again, through RNA-containing jelly consumption ( Figure 6 ). This phenomenon is driven by horizontal RNA transfer among individual bees and across generations. Hence, it demonstrates an inherent nonorganism autonomous RNA -a transmissible RNA route in honey bees.
Larva and adult honey bees can ingest biologically active dsRNA [25, 29] . However, the ability of bees to efficiently take up dietary small RNAs (e.g. miRNAs, siRNAs) is currently debatable [17, 30, 34, 35] . While exchange of dietary RNA among adult bees can reasonably occur via trophallaxis [36] , in our experiments, secretion of jelly that contained dsRNA-GFP required systemic distribution of the environmentally consumed dsRNA within the nurse bee. A few RNA uptake mechanisms have been reported including internalization by extracellular vesicles, dsRNA channels and receptor-mediated endocytosis [37] [38] [39] [40] . Although these mechanisms have demonstrated cellular RNA import, little is known about the systemic spread of RNA through the insect's circulatory system. Here we show that ingested-dsRNA is exported into the bee's hemolymph where at least part of it is not naked, but associated with proteins, forming extracellular ribonucleoprotein complexes. In agreement with previous studies, which determined import preference of long dsRNA [39] [40] [41] in c. elegans and drosophila, we found that the hemolymph dsRNA-protein complex is comprised of long and mostly non-processed dsRNA ( Figure 1B ). These findings led us to propose potential parallel complementary functions of the extracellular dsRNA-protein complex involving stabilization, translocation and introduction of the circulatory RNAi signal to recipient cells and tissues in a specific and/or non-specific manner. Yet, investigating such potential roles would require the identification and characterization of the RNA binding hemolymph proteins in future studies.
Suspected prolonged viral disease resistance in field hives fed on dsRNA homologous to a bee virus (IAPV) [26] , suggested long-term effect of RNAi in treated colonies 3-4 months after the last dsRNA treatment. RNAi maintenance via dsRNA amplification, driven by the viral RdRp and/or endogenous expression [42] [43] [44] , can explain silencing persistence in an individual bee. Nevertheless, it is unlikely to explain long-term protection at the colony level since the honey bee's life span during the summer is ca. six weeks. Worker larvae are fed exclusively royal jelly for three days, and then predominantly jelly, honey and pollen mix. Therefore, the presence of dsRNA-GFP in royal jelly demonstrated jelly-secretion mediated RNA transfer to next generations ( Figure 1C ). Further supporting such nurse to-larva transfer, dsRNA-GFP could be detected in larvae originated from untreated hives, but nourished by workers fed on dsRNA ( Figure 2D ). Reciprocally, dsRNA-GFP could not be detected in eggs laid by a dsRNA-treated queen in an untreated hive ( Figure 1C) . These experiments show that horizontal RNA transfer is the main route to share and spread RNA, at least in a dsRNA form, among the bee population in the hive. However, our results cannot rule out additional vertical transmission of RNA from queen to eggs. Ingestion of dsRNAsupplemented jelly under natural or in vitro conditions has been reported to confer efficient endogenous and exogenous gene silencing in honey bee larvae and newly emerged adults [17, [29] [30] [31] . Here, we show that dsRNA that is secreted into the jelly and consumed by larvae is also biologically potent and can induce a long lasting RNAi that persists until adulthood ( Figure 2B ). Therefore, an interpretation of our results leads us to conclude that RNA transfer to larvae could potentially prime anti-viral RNAi and explain the suspected long term protection against viral disease in infected hives fed on IAPV-dsRNA [26] .
RNAi has been established in insects, including honey bees, as a key immune response against viruses [25, 44, 45] . During infection, local RNAi develops into a systemic signal to control viral spread and propagation in distant cells and tissues. Our data indicates that systemic RNAi signal is not limited to the infected bee, but spreads beyond to other individuals in the hive. Diverse fragments of bacterial, fungal and viral RNA naturally occur in both jellies, representing 25% and 16.75% of total worker and royal jelly RNA, respectively ( Figure 3B , 5A). The presence of both sense and antisense viral sequences suggests secretion of viral RNA originated from cells. Additionally, potential Dicer substrates seem to be common among natural viral jelly RNA ( Figure 5C, Supplementary Figure 3 ), supporting transfer of naturally occurring RNAi triggers to the larvae. Yet, the relative amount of viral RNA is somewhat low in jelly samples collected from healthy looking hives ( Figure 3B ). We previously demonstrated cross species bi-directional RNAi transfer between the honey bee and Varroa mite, which has been applied for Varroa control [13, 46] . Thus, in addition to individual-defense, transmissible RNA could elicit a colony-level protective outcome. Relative to other insects, the honey bee's genome encodes a reduced number and variety of immune gene families. It has been therefore suggested that the bees' behavioral group-defense provides a complementary level of immunity, compensating for the reduction of immune genes [47] . We hypothesize another form of collective defense; social immunity that is engendered through transfer of pathogen-related RNA among members in the hive.
It is generally agreed that RNAi evolved as a defense mechanism against selfish nucleic acids and further diversified to regulate endogenous gene expression. The presence of differential naturally occurring RNA among worker and royal jellies points towards a potential effect of transmissible RNA on genome function in recipient bees. Indeed, supplementing jelly with endogenous or exogenous miRNAs that are naturally enriched in worker jelly affected gene expression as well as developmental and morphological characters of newly emerged workers and queens [17, 30] . We speculate that bee to-larva RNA transfer could also play a role in epigenetic dynamics among honey bees. A general involvement of epigenetics in the phenotypic plasticity of female bees has been demonstrated [22] [23] [24] . Nonetheless, it is still not understood how castespecific epigenetic marking is directed. Continuous uptake of regulatory jelly RNA could contribute towards a specific gene-expression profile of a genome with a potential to differentiate into two castes; hence, shifting towards an emergence of worker or queen. Making of a queen is a multilevel process and presumably there are numerous factors interplaying one with the other. Further research should molecularly determine the impact of jelly RNA and its relation to other identified players, such as Royalactin [21] .
The presented mechanistic experiments with artificial RNA and the occurrence of natural RNA populations in the jellies indicated not only an RNA share among bees, but also its ability to persist in an external non-sterile environment. It has been reported that royal jelly contains bactericide components [48] . Although inhibition of microbial growth could contribute to the stability of RNAs in the jelly, it cannot solely protect against environmentally distributed nucleases and physical degradation. Moreover, after ingestion, jelly RNAs need to be further stabilized in the digestive system of the larva and adult queen, which harbors a diverse microbial population [49] . This raises the question how does the jelly support environmental persistence and activity of RNA?
The GFP sequence and primers as well as dsRNA synthesis procedure were described in Maori et al., 2009 . Apis mellifera sequence that corresponds to the Vitellogenin mRNA (bases 4648-5084; accession no. NM_001011578.1) served as a template for dsRNA-Vg transcription, and was amplified by the following primers: 5' TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAAAAGCTTATCAGAAGGTGGAAGAAAA 3'; 5' TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGACAATGTTTGTTAACGTTATGGTGGTA 3' (T7 promoter in bold). Labeling of GFP-dsRNA was performed using a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche) with a DIG-11-UTP concentration of 70 µm per reaction.
Cloning, transcription, RNA preparations, cDNA synthesis, RNA slot blot, Northernblot, PCR and Proteinase K digestions were carried out according to published protocols (Sambrook & Russell, 2001) or to the manufacturers' instructions. Northern-blot analyses for the detection of labeled-dsRNA were conducted without using a probe; a standard DIG Northern-blot protocol was modified by omitting the probe-hybridization step. Briefly, 10 µl of pooled whole hemolymph extracts (detailed below) were electrophorased in the Northern-blot analyses of labeled dsRNA, using native 1.2% agarose gel. Slot-and Northern-blot analyses for detection of non-labeled dsRNA were probed with a DIG-labeled PCR probe (Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis, IN, USA) of a sequence corresponding to GFP-sequence used as template for the dsRNA-GFP synthesis.
Young worker bees were collected from a single hive and immobilized within plastic straws. Individual bees were fed on 10 µl 50% sucrose solution (w/w) containing DIGlabeled dsRNA-GFP in a final concentration of 50 ng/µl. The control group was fed on 50% sucrose solution (w/w) only. To control dsRNA spillage and cuticle contamination, the immobilized bees were fed directly to their glossa and complete uptake was monitored. Hemolymph was collected from a small incision at the level of the 3rd dorsal tergite, using a microcapillary. The hemolymph of 10 workers was pooled per sample and stored at -80°C for later analysis.
Caged fertile queen bees, together with approximately 250 worker bees, were placed in mini-hives (26x17x15.5 cm polystyrene) fitted with four mini-combs each. The minihives were sealed and placed in a temperature-controlled room (28°C) for three days in which the combs were constructed and queen-workers recognition had been established. During the first three days, the bees were fed on a mixture of 33% honey and 67% sucrose powder (candy). Next, the mini-hives were transferred into two net-houses separating between dsRNA treated, and untreated mini-hives. The bees were free to fly within the net-houses and to forage for water from buckets. The first 14 days were an adaptation period, during which the colonies were fed on demand with candy, and pollen supplement patties (5 g each) were placed on top of the combs and replaced once a week. An established mini-colony was determined by at-least two constructed combs and egg-laying activity of the queen; only these hives were included in the experiment. During all the experiments, established colonies (two per treatment) were fed on pollen supplement patties (5 g each), and had unlimited water supply.
Treated colonies were fed daily on 10 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) containing dsRNA-GFP in a final concentration of 20 ng/µl (200 µg dsRNA-GFP per day), and untreated mini-hives were fed daily on 10 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) only. Feeding dsRNA-GFP was continued for five days and subsequently the colonies were fed only on 50% sucrose solution until the experiment's end. At the beginning of day four, the queens were removed in order for the bees to rear new queens. We waited two hours, and placed artificial queen cells containing 1 st -2 nd instar larvae grafted from a different untreated hive. On day 6, we carefully removed intact 3 rd -4 th instar larvae with a fine paintbrush and harvested royal jelly. Royal jelly was harvested from five artificial queen cells, pooled and stored at -80°C.
Treated colonies were fed daily on 10 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) containing dsRNA-GFP in a final concentration of 20 ng/µl (200 µg dsRNA-GFP per day), and untreated mini-hives were fed daily on 10 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) only. Feeding dsRNA-GFP was continued for eight days. On day five and eight, 4 th-5 th instar larvae were carefully removed from worker brood cells and checked for any physical damage. Worker jelly was collected by washing cells with nuclease free water to resuspend the low jelly quantity available. Samples were stored at -80°C.
Two treated colonies were fed daily on 15 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) containing dsRNA-GFP in a final concentration of 20 ng/µl (300 µg dsRNA-GFP per day), and two untreated mini-hives were fed daily on 15 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) only. Feeding dsRNA-GFP was continued for seven days and subsequently all the colonies were fed only on 50% sucrose solution until the experiment's end. The day in which dsRNA was first introduced represents 'day-1' (Figure 2A ). Samples were collected in different time points, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C for further analysis. Prior to RNA extraction, samples were rigorously washed with nuclease-free water.
For five days, treated colonies were fed daily on 10 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) containing dsRNA-GFP in a final concentration of 20 ng/µl (200 µg dsRNA-GFP per day), and untreated mini-hives were daily fed on 10 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) only. On day six, combs containing 1 st instar larvae were removed from an untreated hive and transferred either to another untreated or dsRNA-treated colony. On day ten, 5 th instar worker larvae were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C for further analysis ( Figure 2C ). Prior to RNA extraction, samples were rigorously washed with nuclease-free water.
For six days, one treated colony was fed daily on 10 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) containing dsRNA-GFP in a final concentration of 20 ng/µl (200 µg dsRNA-GFP per day), and three untreated mini-hives were fed daily on 10 ml of 50% sucrose solution (w/w) only. On day six, the queens from both untreated and dsRNA-treated minihives were caged, and on day seven swapped with other queens as follows: the queen taken from the dsRNA-treated colony replaced the queen of an untreated minihive, and a queen from the untreated colony replaced a queen from another untreated minihive ( Figure 2E ). To allow acclimation, the queens remained caged for a day and then they were released to lay eggs for three days. 100 eggs were collected per treatment on day ten and stored at -80°C for further analysis.
Nine plastic boxes were populated each with ca. 150 workers (collected nearby open brood cells) and a piece of comb containing eggs and young larvae. The plastic boxes were placed in an incubator at 34° C with 45-55% humidity. The boxes were divided into three groups (three boxes per treatment) and were fed daily for eight days with: i) 100µg dsRNA-Vg in 2ml 35% sucrose solution; ii) 100µg dsRNA-GFP in 2ml 35% sucrose solution; and iii) 2ml 35% sucrose solution. Bees were fed with additional 4 ml 35% sucrose solution per day, to avoid hunger. In addition, the bees were routinely fed pollen-sugar supplement to encourage larvae rearing (70% pollen and 30% sugar powder). On day eleven, all cells were sealed and the adult bees were removed. The newly emerged bees were paired for ten days. The pairs were prepared by placing together two bees from different treatments that emerged at the same day and originated from the same hive. Paired bees were fed with 35% sucrose solution and pollen-sugar supplement. On day ten, we collected workers samples from each treatment for Vitellogenin expression analysis.
qRT-PCR reactions were performed using the EvaGreen® qPCR Plus Mix kit (SOLIS BIODYNE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Vitellogenin mRNA was amplified using primers: 5'-CCAAACTGGAACGGGACCTGC-3' and 5'-TGTAGCTGTCAGTCGGCGTGC-3'. Calmodulin was used as a control for normalization using primers: 5'-CGAGAGAGAACGGTGGACTC-3' and 5'-ATACGACACAGCCGACGAG -3'. Statistical analyses were conducted with JMP statistical software version 13 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. To test for significant differences in relative expression of Vg in workers, one-way ANOVA was conducted on dCt values as previously described [50] .
Significant differences between treatments were tested by the Tukey-Kramer (HSD) test.
Royal jelly was collected from queen brood cells containing 3 rd instar larvae, and worker jelly was collected from 5 th instar worker larvae brood cells; all brood belonged to untreated healthy looking hives. The jelly samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C for further analysis. Total RNA extracted from worker and royal jellies was subjected to Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP) treatment using the Cap-Clip enzyme (CellScript). Modified RNA was purified again by standard Phenol/Chloroform extraction followed by Ethanol precipitation in the presence of Glycogen. The RNA pellet was taken up in 12 ul nuclease-free water. RNA quality and quantity was verified using Agilent RNA 6000 pico chip on a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument. Libraries construction and sequencing were provided by Cambridge Genomic Services (Cambridge University). Briefly, full-length RNA libraries were prepared using the NEXTflex small RNA-seq kit v3 (Bioo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications; Adaptor ligation was .

The bead cleanup (step F) was performed following an amended one-sided purification protocol to retain also long fragments (no size selection protocol) as provided by the manufacturer. The final purification of the PCR product (step H1) followed also the amended protocol without size selection as provided by the manufacturer. Sequencing was performed in a NextSeq 500 instrument, in a 150 bp paired-end read run using the high output kit (300 cycle). RNA-seq data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under accession number E-MTAB-6557.
An in-house script utilizing cutadapt (version 1.11) [51] , fastx_trimmer (FASTX Toolkit 0.0.13) [52] and FastQC (version v0.10.1) [53] was used to trim raw fastq files. Briefly, Illumina NEXTflex small RNA 5' and 3' adapter sequences were trimmed from paired-end fastq sample files, while retaining sequences that were at least 23 bp long. Due to the two colour method of sequencing and other technical sequencing considerations, reads that were shorter than the total number of sequencing cycles had a poly-A tail followed by a poly-G tail that were both trimmed. Then, the four random index bases were trimmed from both ends of the sequences. Next, 5' and 3' Illumina NEXTflex small RNA adapter sequences were trimmed anew and only sequences for which the length of both paired reads was at least 15bp long were retained. QC, performed with FastQC, revealed low quality bases at both ends of the reads. These low quality bases were trimmed using fastx_trimmer and an additional QC run indicated that all the samples are properly trimmed. Total number of reads that passed trimming and QC per library is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. All in-house scripts have been deposited in Github and can be downloaded: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1302437.
The genome of A. mellifera was downloaded from ensembl (release 32). Using in-house scripts (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1302437), the fastq files (R1 & R2) of each royal and jelly sample were converted into fasta files, which were then aligned to the A. mellifera genome using blat [54] . The best hit for each R1 mapped read was matched with the best hit for its R2 mapped read. Therefore determining the final mapping of the read as well as the size of its matching RNA.
For each royal and worker jelly sample, we computed the length of the sequenced RNA's independent of any genome alignment. That is, we used blat to align an R1 read and the reverse complement of its matching R2 read. We then calculated the length of the sequence the two reads span from the 5' of R1 to the 3' of R2. The size of reads that did not overlap is indicated as being greater that the length of the longer between the R1 and R2 reads (e.g. >38 where 38 is the length in bp of the longer read). Using the described method, we managed to map the size of approximately 98.5% of the all the reads in each of the samples
To compare the size distributions of RNA in royal jelly and worker jelly samples, we computed a histogram of all RNA sizes present in the jellies and calculated the log of Reads Per Million, hereof denoted as RPM, using the following formula:
To compute the log(RPM) of royal and worker jelly samples in general, we calculated the average number of RNA's in each size group for all royal / worker jelly samples, that is | ! |, and used it to calculate the general royal / worker log(RPM) value using the following formula:
To identify the origin of royal and worker jelly RNAs we used blat [54] to map the RNA sequences against the genomes of A. mellifera, 13 viral genomes, 5243 bacterial genomes, 1038 fungi genomes and two plant genomes. The names and the sizes of the genomes are depicted in Supplementary Table 2 . Each of the royal and worker jelly RNA samples were mapped to the above mentioned genomes and the percentage of RNA mapped to each specie were recorded as the number of RNA sequences mapped to each specie out of the total number of RNA sequences in the sample. The RNA in each sample were first searched against the bee genome and then against viral genomes, bacterial genomes, fungi genomes and finally against plant genomes. Each blat search was performed with the RNAs that did not match the previous genome they were searched against. That is, all the RNAs in each sample were searched against the bee genome but only RNA reads that did not match the bee genome were searched against viral genomes, only RNAs that did not match any of the viral genomes were searched against bacterial genomes etc'. In order to calculate the number of RNA sequences mapped to each genome for each type of jelly (i.e. royal / worker), the data from the three royal jelly samples were treated as a single sample and the data from the three worker jelly samples were treated as a single sample. We then recorded the percentage of RNAs that were mapped to each species for the merged royal jelly samples and for the merged worker jelly samples. For individual sample analysis, we simply recorded the percentage of RNAs that were mapped to each species for each royal or worker jelly sample.
We used the ensembl annotation file for the genome of A. mellifera (release 32) to characterize the jelly RNA corresponding to the honey bee genome. Using an in-house script, we converted the ensembl annotation file into a bed format file and intersected it with a bed file version of the RNAs corresponding to the honey bee genome using intersectBed (bedtools version 2.17.0) [55] . The number of RNAs in each annotation category was then recorded, excluding matches in which the overlap between the RNA and the annotation element was shorter than 7bp. To further characterize the jellies corresponding to the honey bee genome, we performed a blat search against two transposable elements (TE) databases, the TREP database (release 16) [56] and RepBase (version 22.04) [57] . The number of RNAs that mapped to each of the TE categories was then recorded from which the percentage of each TE category was calculated.
To detect the presence of pathogen-related RNA, we performed a blat search [54] against 13 honey bee viral genomes (Supplementary Table 2 ). That is, the RNAs of each of the six jelly samples were searched against each of the viral genomes and their genomic position, length (i.e. insert length), orientation (i.e. forward/reverse) and abundance, relative to each viral genome, were obtained (Supplementary Tables 3 and  4 ).
To enable a comparison between the abundance of virus-related RNAs in each of the 13 viral genomes, we calculated for each jelly (i.e. royal or worker) its log(TPM), where TPM = Transcripts Per Million, using the following formula:
To analyze the size distribution of viral RNAs for each jelly type (i.e. royal / worker) or for each sample separately, we grouped the various insert lengths into nine distinct size groups: 15-19nt, 20-25nt, 26-31nt, 32-50nt, 51-75nt, 76-100nt, 101-125nt, 126-200nt and >200nt and calculated the log(TPM) of each viral genome in each size group using the following formula:

To evaluate the abundance of viral RNAs along the genome of each virus, we calculated the log(TPM) at each position along the viral genome of each virus using the following formula: A) Presence of ingested dsRNA in the hemolymph. Probe-free Northern blot analysis performed on pooled raw hemolymph extracts (ten bees per pool, 10 µl per well). Raw hemolymph extracts were collected from bees that were fed on 50% sucrose solution (w/w) containing DIG-labeled dsRNA-GFP, or sucrose solution only. The 430 bp band represents free full-length dsRNA.
Association of ingested-dsRNA with a protein complex in the hemolymph. Probefree Northern blot analysis performed on untreated or protease K-treated pooled raw hemolymph extracts (ten bees per pool, 10 µl per well). The hemolymph in both treatments was derived from the same hemolymph sample.
Occurrence of ingested dsRNA in the larval diets and newly laid eggs from dsRNA-GFP treated and untreated minihives. Northern blot analysis of 1 µg total RNA extracted from worker jelly (WJ), royal jelly (RJ) and eggs. Eggs were laid in untreated minihives by queens that were transferred from dsRNA-treated or untreated minihives. Purified dsRNA-GFP was used as a positive control and a size marker for full-length dsRNA.
A) Experimental design for detecting RNA transmission within the hive. Reproductive minihives contained ca. 250 bees and an active queen. Treated colonies were provided with 300 µg dsRNA-GFP in 50% sucrose solution (w/w) per feeding. Control minihives were fed on 50% sucrose solution (w/w) only. Adult bees and brood were sampled from the available developmental stages.
Occurrence of dsRNA in adult bees and its transfer to the next generation. RNA slotblot analysis of 1.5 µg total RNA extracted from individual larvae, pupae and adult bees from dsRNA-GFP treated or untreated colonies (Figure 2A ).
Experimental design to test horizontal RNA transfer among bees. Reproductive minihives contained ca. 250 bees and an active queen. Treated colonies were provided with 200 µg dsRNA-GFP in 50% sucrose solution (w/w) per feeding. Control minihives were fed on 50% sucrose solution (w/w) only.
Transfer of dsRNA from worker bees to nourished larvae. 1 st instar larvae were transferred from untreated hive and nourished by workers from dsRNA treated or untreated minihives for four days. Northern blot of 5 µg total RNA extracted from individual 5 th instar larvae.
Experimental design to test vertical RNA transfer among bees. Reproductive minihives contained ca. 250 bees and an active queen. Treated colonies were provided with 200 µg dsRNA-GFP in 50% sucrose solution (w/w) per feeding. Control minihives were fed on 50% sucrose solution (w/w) only. Queens from dsRNA treated or untreated minihives were removed to untreated minihives. The queens were then isolated for two days to acclimatize. Next, the queens were released and their newly laid eggs were collected.
F) Transmissible RNA is biologically active. Vitellogenin (Vg) knockdown in ten-days old workers that were nourished as larvae by dsRNA-Vg treated bees. Vg expression was quantified by RT-qPCR. Values were normalized relative to a reference calmodulin gene. Individual workers were tested in the untreated (N=6), dsRNA-GFP (N=6), and dsRNA-Vg (N=7) treatments. Data are shown as the mean ±SE. Different letters above the plots indicate statistically significant difference according to the Tukey-Kramer (HSD) test (P<0.05).
A) Size distribution of naturally occurring royal and worker jelly RNA. RNA size was determined through sequencing full-length jelly RNA by a small RNA-seq protocol that was adapted to sequence broad full RNA length spectrum (i.e. 15-200 nt). Data represent a merged analysis of three biological repeats per jelly and are presented as the normalized number of Reads Per Million (RPM). Common peak sizes are marked in black font, and differential sizes in red font. A) A working model for transmissible RNA pathway in honey bees. Bees are able to take up RNA from the environment through ingestion. The ingested RNA is taken up from the digestive system through the epithelial gut cells to the circulatory system, the hemolymph. In the hemolymph, ingested extracellular RNA is associated with a protein complex and systemically spread, including to the jelly producing hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands. Then, ingested and other RNAs are secreted in the royal and worker jellies. A new environmental RNA cycle is initiated through ingestion of jellycontaining RNA. A few potential RNA sources could participate in the transmissible RNA pathway including systemic antiviral RNAi and endogenous mobile RNA, jelly-.

Three biological samples were individually sequenced per jelly; sequencing outcomes were merged and analysed. Data are presented as the number of reads normalized to log Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM). Reads that correspond to the sense viral RNA strand (genome) are in positive TPM values, and reads that derived from the antisense viral RNA strand (anti-genome) are in negative TPM values. Not all viruses could be detected in both jellies.

0da2ec30d7dfdef624833a36890f0297f19d09ec,"Compound heterozygotes occur when different mutations at the same locus on both maternal and paternal chromosomes produce a recessive trait. Here we present the tool VarCount for the quantification of mutations at the individual level. We used VarCount to characterize compound heterozygous coding variants in patients with epileptic encephalopathy and in the 1000 genomes participants. The Epi4k data contains variants identified by whole exome sequencing in patients with either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or Infantile Spasms (IS), as well as their parents. We queried the Epi4k dataset (264 trios) and the phased 1000 genomes data (2504 participants) for recessive variants. To assess enrichment, transcript counts were compared between the Epi4k and 1000 genomes participants using minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoffs of 0.5% and 1.0%, and including all ancestries or only probands of European ancestry. In the Epi4k participants, we found enrichment for rare, compound heterozygous mutations in six genes, including three involved in neuronal growth and development -PRTG (p=0.00086, 1% MAF, combined ancestries), TNC (p=0.0221% MAF, combined ancestries), and MACF1 (p=0.0245, 0.5% MAF, EU ancestry). Due the total number of transcripts considered in these analyses, the enrichment detected was not significant after correction for multiple testing and higher powered or prospective studies are necessary to validate the candidacy of these genes.
However, PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are potential novel recessive epilepsy genes and our results highlight that compound heterozygous mutations should be considered in sporadic epilepsy.","Using the premise that effective variants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with common polymorphisms and haplotypes, linkage and association studies have identified genes involved in the development of traits and pathologies. Upon their identification, the regions flanking associated markers are sequenced to find the linked, penetrant mutation. However, rare variants are often not detectable using LD-based methods.
This problem has been alleviated by recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) , and the detection of highly penetrant rare variants associated with disease has reduced the heritability gap for such diseases as autism, Crohn's disease, and osteoporosis (Bomba, Walter, & Soranzo, 2017; Kosmicki, Churchhouse, Rivas, & Neale, 2016) . Despite these advances, for most traits and complex disorders the underlying genes and mutations remain elusive.
Recessive traits are caused by mutations in both copies of a gene. The mutations may be homozygous, i.e. identical, or compound heterozygous. Compound heterozygous (CH) mutations are two different mutations in a gene on opposite alleles of a chromosome and it is speculated that compound heterozygous mutations account for many recessive diseases (Li et al., 2010; Sanjak, Long, & Thornton, 2017) . Lack of detection of CH may explain a significant portion of missing heritability for all phenotypes (Li et al., 2010; Sanjak et al., 2017; Zhong, Karssen, Kayser, & Liu, 2016) .
Association studies using polymorphisms are LD-based and recent association studies using rare variants compare total variant burden between cases and controls to account for the contributions of multiple alleles at a locus to phenotype. Importantly, because LD-based studies require recessive mutations to be on the same genetic background and total variant burden analyses are not allele-specific, neither discerns between dominant and recessive models of inheritance. 2010). The vcf files were then annotated with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) from EVS (Exome Variant Server, NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA (URL: http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/)), 1000 genomes and ExAC (Monkol Lek et al., 2015) , and with information regarding the effect of each variant using SNPSift/SNPEff (Cingolani et al., 2012) . The databases used for annotation were dbNSFP2.9 (for MAF and CADD score) and GRCh37.75 for protein effect prediction.
SnpSift was used to remove any variants not inducing a protein-changing event (not ""HIGH"" or ""MODERATE"" impact) based on SNPEff annotation -this includes missense, nonsense, splice-site and insertion/deletion variants. Variants with quality flags and multiallelic variants, i.e. those with more than two known nucleotide values, were also removed. Variants remaining after filtering were cross-referenced with the 1000 genomes variants from the same MAF threshold to ensure that any variants removed from one dataset were removed from the other. The annotated vcf was used as input for VarCount. Ancestry for each exome was determined using LASER (Wang et al.) and this information was input to VarCount via the SampleInfo.txt file. Ancestry and phenotype information for each proband are described in Supplementary Table 1. In addition to the annotated vcf file, the parameters.txt and subjectinfo.txt (containing sex and ancestry information) were used as input. Within the parameters file, the following qualifications were selected: (1) counting at the transcript (rather than gene) level, (2) protein-changing effects, (3) MAF threshold of either 0.005 or 0.01, (4) all within-dataset and annotated (1000 genomes, ExAC and EVS) MAFs, and (5) either compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations. Analyses were run separately for the two MAFs and using all Epi4k probands (264) and only those of Eurpoean ancestry (207) . Because the variants were not phased, VarCount was used to query the vcf file for individuals with two or more mutations in each transcript. The output, a list of author/funder. All rights reserved.

Final counts were determined using parental genotype information. Custom python scripts were used to query for parental genotypes and to count true compound heterozygotes or homozygotes. De novo mutations were excluded in the determination of true in trans mutations.
Vcf files for the 2504 participants in the 1000 genomes sequencing project (Genomes Project et al., 2015) were downloaded by chromosome from the 1000 genomes ftp site.
To reduce input file size, the genomic regions for the hg19 mRNA transcripts were downloaded via UCSC's Table Browser and used to remove non-coding regions from the vcf files. Including all exons from UCSC allowed for a more conservative analysis, given that the Epi4k data were sequenced using various exome captures, which are not inclusive of all possible exons. The variants were annotated and filtered via the same steps as the Epi4k vcf file. Multi-allelic variants were also removed prior to analysis by VarCount. A diagram showing the steps involved in processing and analyzing the variant files is shown in (Figure 1 ). VCF files were queried for homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations using VarCount. Because the variants in the 1000 genomes vcf files are phased, determining true compound heterozygotes is automatic using VarCount. In addition to the annotated vcf file, the parameters.txt and subjectinfo.txt (containing sex and ancestry information) were used as input.

The final output from analyses was for each MAF cutoff and for each population, counts for every transcript in which at least one individual harbored recessive variants.
Using R statistical software, a Fisher's exact test was used to detect transcripts with significant differences in the proportion of individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous variants between the Epi4k dataset and the 1000 genomes dataset. Odds ratios and p-values were calculated using the number of individuals with and without qualifying mutations in each superpopulation. Analyses were performed using all ancestries, and for only individuals of European ancestry. Both Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments were used to determine significance thresholds after correction for multiple testing. The number of tests was based on the number of transcripts with at least one individual in either the Epi4k or 1000 genomes dataset with in trans coding variants with minor allele frequencies below the set threshold.
The three-dimensional structure of Protogenin (PRTG) was modeled off the crystal structure of the human receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PDB: 4PBX; 25.1% sequence identity) using MODELLER 9.14 (Webb & Sali, 2016 ). The resultant model superimposed with the template had an RSMD of 4.94 Å over 442 Ca atoms.
Protein and solvent dielectric constants were set to 2.0 and 78.0, respectively. All structural figures were generated by PyMOL(W).
Varcount is a free, open source tool useful for the quantification of heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous mutations per sample. Input variants may be phased or unphased. All python scripts and supporting files may be downloaded from Github at https://github.com/GeneSleuth/VarCount. Supporting files include the ""parameters.txt"" file where the user may select variant filters for mutation effect, minor allele frequency, and inheritance pattern (homozygous, compound heterozygous, one mutation or two mutations), and Sample filters based on information entered into the ""SampleInfo file"". Input vcf files must be annotated with SNPSift/SNPEff using the dbNSFP and GRCh37/38 databases. A readme file with instructions is also provided.

We used VarCount to query the Epi4k dataset for rare homozygous and CH mutations.
The Epi4k data are whole exome data from 264 trios with a child affected by epileptic encephalopathy, either infantile spasms (IS) or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (6).
Counts were performed using individuals of all ancestries or just those of European ancestry (207/264). Individuals from the 1000 genomes study were used as controls.
The individual counts and p-values for the analyses are listed in (Supplementary Tables   2-5 ). Including only rare variants (MAFs below 0.5% and 1.0%) determined enrichment for compound heterozygous mutations in six genes. For combined ancestries, the six genes are in order of significance: OSBP2, PRTG, ABCC11, MACF1, STAB1, and TNC.
PRTG and TNC were also highly ranked in the 1% MAF analysis, with one additional count for each transcript. Variants for all six genes are listed in Table 1 . In our analysis of just individuals of European ancestry, MACF1 was the most significantly enriched gene using a 0.5% MAF. The p-values indicated in Table 1 are for individual tests; there were no p-values significant after correction for multiple testing.

The de novo variants identified by Epi4K Consortium and the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (Epi et al., 2013) in the nine probands with either PRTG, TNC, or MACF1 recessive variants are described in Table 2 . For the three patients with compound heterozygous PRTG variants, one patient harbors a de novo missense variant in HSF2, the second has a nonsense variant in CELSR1, and the third patient has two de novo variants -a missense in Fam102A and a 3'UTR variant in USP42.

The first patient has a 5' and 3'UTR de novo variant in FAM19A2 and GLRA2, respectively and the second patient also has a 3'UTR de novo change in the gene LRRC8D and a missense change in SNX30. One de novo variant was identified in the third proband in the gene FAM227A. Polyphen2 categories and CADD scores for each de novo variant as well as missense and loss-of-function constraint metric values for each gene (from ExAC) are also listed in Table 2 . The z-score is a ratio of expected to identified missense variants in a particular gene, and pLI is a gene's probability of being loss-of-function intolerant. These constraint metrics are calculated using genomic data from controls without severe genetic diseases in the ExAC database (Monkol Lek et al., 2015) .

Epileptic encephalopathies are a group of severe, early-onset seizure disorders with consistent EEG abnormalities that over time interfere with development and cause cognitive decline (Covanis, 2012) . The Epi4k dataset contains exome sequence from 264 trios that include a proband with epileptic encephalopathy, either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or Infantile Spasms (IS). LGS is characterized by frequent, mixed epileptic seizures that arise most frequently between the ages of 3 and 5 (Amrutkar and Riel-Romero, 2018) . IS occurs during the first year of life and is cryptic in its presentation, with mild head bobbing and is often not detected until the seizures have caused significant neurological damage (Kossoff, 2010) . IS often progress into LGS over time.

We developed a free and user-friendly tool, VarCount, to query vcf files for individuals harboring variants that qualify according to user specification. To test its function, we used VarCount to quantify rare, compound heterozygous mutations in probands from the Epi4k trio dataset and found enrichment for variants in six genes including PRTG, TNC and MACF1. PRTG codes for protogenin, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is involved in axis elongation and neuronal growth during early vertebrate development (Toyoda, Nakamura, & Watanabe, 2005; Vesque, Anselme, Couve, Charnay, & Schneider-Maunoury, 2006) . TNC and MACF1 are also directly involved in neuronal development and/or growth. TNC (Tenascin-C) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in axonal growth and guidance (Jakovcevski, Miljkovic, Schachner, & Andjus, 2013) . Seizures up-regulate TNC in the hippocampus, and in a pilocarpine epilepsy model up-regulation was shown to be mediated by TGF-b signalling (Mercado-Gomez, Landgrave-Gomez, Arriaga-Avila, Nebreda-Corona, & Guevara-Guzman, 2014). MACF1 is a cytoskeletal crosslinking protein highly expressed in the brain and is crucial for neuron development and migration (Moffat, Ka, Jung, Smith, & Kim, 2017) . MACF1 mutations are associated with the neurological pathologies Parkinson's disease, autism, and schizophrenia (Moffat et al., 2017) .
Recently, highly penetrant de novo MACF1 mutations were identified in several patients with a newly characterized lissencephaly with a complex brain malformation (Dobyns et al., 2018) . This new phenotype highlights MACF1 mutations' variable impact on disease pathogenesis. Given both the enrichment in Epi4k probands for compound heterozygous mutations in these genes as well as their known involvement in neuronal processes, we suggest that PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are candidate recessive epilepsy genes.

The primary publication reporting analysis of the Epi4k trio dataset was a description of de novo mutations in the probands (Epi et al., 2013 ). An analysis of compound heterozygous variants was also reported, using a minor allele frequency cutoff of 0.15%, which is lower than the cutoff used in the work presented here. In this analysis, the parents were used as internal controls, and compound heterozygous variants in 351 genes were identified, without genome-wide significance. The authors only listed five of the genes which are known to cause Mendelian disorders that include a seizure phenotype -ASPM, CNTNAP2, GPR98, PCNT, and POMGNT1. In our analysis using the 1000 genomes participants as controls, enrichment for compound heterozygous variants was not detected in any of these genes. Using the number of individuals with in trans variants in a gene (transcript) as an indicator function required at least two probands to have qualifying variants in order to detect single-test significance, with complete absence of qualifying variants in controls. It is clear from the analyses using either internal controls or the 1000 genomes as controls that a larger sample size is required to achieve genome-wide significance.
The de novo variants reported by the Epi4K Consortium and the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (Epi et al., 2013) in the nine probands with compound heterozygous variants in PRTG, TNC, or MACF1 are described in Table 2 . Of the twelve genes with de novo variants identified in the nine patients, three are implicated in neurological disease. CELSR1 is a planar cell polarity gene in which mutations are known to cause neural tube defects including spina bifida (Robinson et al., 2012) . De novo deletions of DIP2C have been reported in two patients with cerebral palsy, one of whom also had ADHD, and the other had seizures in infancy (Zarrei et al., 2018) . In another report, deletions including DIP2C and/or ZMYND11 were identified in several patients with developmental delay including three patients with seizures (DeScipio et author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/496133 doi: bioRxiv preprint al., 2012). GLRA2 is a glycine receptor involved in neurodevelopment in which mutations are implicated in autism, (Pilorge et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017) including a patient with comorbid epilepsy (Zhang et al., 2017) .
Of the de novo variants reported in these genes, the nonsense variant in CELSR1 identified in one of the probands with in trans PRTG variants is the most likely to be pathogenic. However, regarding their involvement in neural tube defects, mutations in CELSR1 are thought to contribute to pathogenesis but not in a Mendelian fashion, as variants have been found to be inherited from unaffected parents or to be ineffective in functional assays (Robinson et al., 2012; Allache et al., 2012) . The nonsense CELSR1 mutation in the patient reported here may contribute to epilepsy in the presence of a genetic modifier. The de novo missense mutation in DIP2C is predicted to be deleterious (CADD = 23.6) and has a low rate of benign missense variation based on constraint metrics (z = 5.82). The de novo variant in GLRA2 is in the 3'UTR so it is difficult to predict its impact on gene function and subsequent pathogenicity.
The compound heterozygous variants in PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are similarly variable in predicted pathogenicity, with CADD scores ranging from between less than one to thirty-eight. PRTG and TNC both have constraint metrics indicative of a high tolerance to both missense and loss-of-function variants, while MACF1 is moderately intolerant of missense variants (z = 2.63) and extremely intolerant of loss-of-function variants (pLI = 1.0). Interestingly, aside from the 3'UTR variant in GLRA2, none of the de novo variants in the Epi4k participants with MACF1 compound heterozygous variants are in genes associated with neurological disease or predicted with confidence to have a negative impact on gene function. This, in addition to MACF1's intolerance to missense or nonsense variants, is supportive of the pathogenicity of the biallelic variants in the gene. author/funder. All rights reserved.

In summary, we present a free tool VarCount for the quantification of qualifying mutations as an indicator function per individual in the analysis of variant lists (vcf files). We used VarCount to assess enrichment of rare, coding, compound heterozygous variants in a cohort of 264 epilepsy probands and found enrichment in three genes involved in neurodevelopmental processes -PRTG, TNC and MACF1. A missense change at the E104 residue of PRTG was identified three times in two different probands. Significance was not maintained after correction for multiple testing, and larger cohorts or candidate gene studies using a different sample set are necessary to validate this enrichment. In the context of the de novo mutations also present in these patients, experimentation is necessary in order to delineate if the compound heterozygous or de novo mutations, or both, are pathogenic in the development of epileptic encephalopathy. PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are candidate recessive epilepsy genes and our work highlights that inheritance of compound heterozygous variants should not be excluded from gene discovery or diagnostic analyses of patients with epilepsy.

0e2ba405f636e06821999876cd82c00e26404b43,"Members of the Nidovirales order have (+)RNA genomes amongst the largest in size in the RNA virus world. Expression of their genes is promoted through reading of genomic RNA and mRNA transcripts by the ribosome of the infected cell. The 5'-end of these RNAs is supposedly protected by an RNA-cap structure (m7GpppNm) whose most synthesis steps remain elusive. In Eukaryotes, the RNA-cap structure is methylated by RNA methyltransferases (MTases) at the RNA-cap N7-guanine position as well as the 2'-O methyl position of the first transcribed nucleotide. In Coronaviridae, two separate enzymes (nsp14 and nsp16) perform the N7-guanine and the 2'-OH methylation, respectively. One salient feature of the Nidovirales N7-guanine MTase nsp14 is that it is the only example of non-Rossman fold viral MTase known so far. Conversely, all other Nidovirales nsp16-like MTases have a canonical Rossman fold. Many Nidovirales members lack either any RNA MTase signature sequence (e.g., Arteriviridae), or lack a N7-guanine MTase signature sequence (e.g., Tobaniviridae, Euroniviridae, Roniviridae, Medioniviridae). Both nsp14-and nsp16-like enzyme genes are usually located in Orf1b encoding for the replication machinery. Here, we report the discovery of a putative Rossman fold RNA MTase in the Orf1a of ten Tobaniviridae members. Multiple sequence alignments and structural analyses identify this novel gene as a typical RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase with substrate specificity and active-site organization similar to the canonical eukaryotic RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/639369 doi: bioRxiv preprint Up to recently, four viral families, Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae constituted the Nidovirales order. The Coronaviridae family was further divided in two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. The Torovirinae family contained two genus Torovirus and Bafinivirus, plus few unassigned species. Recently, the ICTV proposed a novel classification into the Nidovirales order, with the creation of nine families [1] . In this novel ICTV proposal, ratified on February 2019, Coronaviridae do not encompass both Coronavirinae and Toronavirinae subfamilies. Rather, the new suborder Tornidovirinae (including toroviruses and bafiniviruses) contains a novel family, Tobaniviridae, at the same level as the Coronaviridae, which is now within suborder Cornidovirineae. This new taxonomy is used here, as depicted in Fig. 1 .
Nidovirales have attracted much attention in the past decades for being causative agents of serious diseases in humans and animals. In humans, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) have been associated with high fatality/case ratios of ∼10% and ∼35 %, respectively (reviewed in [2]). In animals, pathogens of significant economical and societal impact include Equine Arteritis virus (EAV, Alphaarterivirus equid) and Porcine Reproductive Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRSSV 1-2, Betaarterivirus suid 1-2).
Two salient features of these viruses are, amongst others, their complex and still obscure replication/transcription mechanism as well as their broad genome-size range. Genomes of Arteriviridae (12.7 -15.7 kb in length), Mesoniviridae (∼20 kb), Medioniviridae (20.2 -25 kb), Euroniviridae (∼24.5 kb), Roniviridae (∼26 kb) Tobaniviridae and Coronaviridae (∼27-32 kb), Abyssoviridae (35.9 kb), and Mononiviridae (41.1 kb) members, share a similar genomic organisation generating viral mRNAs from a fixed genomic location, the 'nest', which has inspired the family name (Nido : latin for 'nest') [3, 4] . Nidovirales genomic and mRNAs are presumably capped, although direct demonstration of the presence of an RNA cap structure is still missing for many of these Nidovirales members.
In Eukaryotes, the RNA cap structure is thought to be synthesized post-transcriptionally [5] .
Most of (+)RNA viruses supposedly follow a conventional RNA capping pathway [6] in which nascent viral 5'-triphosphate genomic (or mRNAs) is thought to be processed through three enzymatic reactions to yield an RNA cap whose structure is indistinguishable from that of cellular mRNAs. The capping pathway implies that the 5'-triphosphate RNA is hydrolyzed into 5'-diphosphate by an RNA triphosphatase, a GMP residue (the « cap », coming from GTP) is next covalently transferred to the 5'-diphosphate RNA in the 5' to 5' orientation by a guanlylyltransferase (GTase), releasing inorganic pyrophosphate. Both the cap and the first transcribed nucleotide are then methylated at the N7-guanine (mGpppN-RNA, so-called Cap0 structure) and the 2'-oxygen position (mGpppNm-RNA, Cap1 structure) by one or two RNA methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. The MTase uses S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor and releases S-Adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH).
There is no high-resolution structural analysis available of Nidovirales RNA caps. The evidence for their presence comes from immunological detection in Torovirus genomic and mRNAs [7] , and co-migration analysis in low-resolution chromatographic techniques for MHV [8] and Simian Hemorragic fever virus [9] . In other instances, Nidovirales cap structures supposedly conform to the canonical eukaryotic RNA capping pathway because enzymes usually deemed necessary to perform RNA capping are present in cognate genomes (reviewed in [6]). Bioinformatic analyses have been used to detect signature-sequences typically associated with RNA capping/modifying enzymes i.e guanlylyltransferase (GTase), polymerase, helicase, nuclease, and methyltransferase (MTase). These signature-sequences have served in many instances to isolate corresponding enzymes endowed with the predicted activity. In Nidovirales, this approach has been pioneered for Coronavirus enzymes, yet author/funder. All rights reserved.

Until then, viral MTases matched a specific structural architecture, the Rossmann fold (RF), which possess a unique interaction geometry that represents a fingerprint of common ancestry. The discovery of a non-Rossmann fold (NRF) MTase unveiled the limitation of annotating ""dark proteome"" data [15] , lacking structural counterparts. In Nidovirales, enzyme activities have been experimentally evidenced only for coronaviruses and roniviruses [16] . The putative first step of the Nidovirales RNA capping pathway, involving a 5'-triphosphatase, is uncertain: such activity exists in the Coronavirus helicase (nsp13, [17] ), but its involvement in RNA capping has not been directly demonstrated. The guanylyltransferase also remains unknown: A nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) activity was found to be associated to the N-terminus of the arterivirus nsp9 RdRp [18] , but its role in arterivirus RNA synthesis, if any, remains to be determined.
Despite the conservation of MTases amongst large Nidovirales genomes, their distribution, type, and the function of MTases in the Nidovirales order is not homogenous (summarized in Table 1 , see text). Arterivirus or arterivirus-like genomes are not known to carry any obvious MTase signature sequence; Mesonivirus and Ronivirus genomes code for one 2'-O RF-MTase (nsp16-like) signature-sequence; The Tobaniviridae (e.g., toroviruses and bafiniviruses, see Fig. 1 ) carry a single 2'-O RF-MTase (nsp16-like) signature sequence, whereas Coronaviridae carry both a N7-guanine non-RF-MTase (NRF-MTase, nsp14-like) and a 2'-O RF-MTase (nsp16-like) signature-sequence. A single deviation for this MTasebased grouping is that of Fathead minnow nidovirus 1 (Tobaniviridae) which carries both MTases (see below) as in the case of Coronaviridae.
The Coronavirus nsp14 is a peculiar, bi-functional enzyme combining in N-terminus a 3'-to-5' exonuclease domain (ExoN) fused to the N7-guanine NRF-MTase domain in C-terminus [4, 11, 12, 19, 20] . First, it is the only known example of a viral SAM-dependent RNA MTase (and more generally, a unique example of an RNA-Cap 0 N7-guanine MTase) that does not have a Rossman fold [11] . Since the Rossman fold is extremely widely distributed in all kingdoms of life, why this NRF-MTase fold has appeared or been conserved through evolution is puzzling. Second, the ExoN activity of nsp14 is a marker of large RNA genomes [21] . The ExoN domain confers capability of RNA mismatch repair to the replicative complex, ensuring genetic stability [11, 20, 22] .
There is still a significant gap of general knowledge on Nidovirales RNA capping. For example, i) the guanylyltransferase step is still elusive in the whole order; ii) if any cap exists in Arteriviridae, how is RNA cap methylation achieved ? and iii) how is the cap N7-guanine methylated in Tobaniviridae and Roniviridae, since there is no N7-guanine MTase clearly identified in these families?
In this paper, we report the discovery of an RNA-cap N7-guanine RF-MTase sequence in the Orf1a of ten members of the Tobaniviridae family. Remarkably, within this family, this MTase is absent from mammalian toroviruses, but may well represent a genetic marker of non-mammalian Tobaniviridae.

Virus genome sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=439488) or Genbank (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank). The data set (given in Table 1 ) was that of Lauber et al. [21] , to which novel or recently described genome sequences (retrieved in NCBI of GenBank) were added purposely. Additionally, the putative and unpublished Palaemon nidovirus and Western flower thrips nidovirus, and the proposed Botrylloides leachii nidovirus [23] , were identified in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) runs SRR5658389, SRR492945 and SRR2729873, respectively, and the virus sequences were assembled, curated and annotated as described elsewhere [24, 25] . The resulting sequences are available upon request to H.D.
The conserved Nidovirales C-terminus RdRp core was used to build phylogenetic trees based on MAFFT v7.427 multiple sequence alignment with BLOSUM62 scoring matrix and G-INSi iterative refinement method. The alignments were used as input for maximum likelihood trees generated with the FasTtree v2.1.5 software (best-fit model = JTT-Jones-Taylor-Thorton with single rate of evolution for each site = CAT). Local support values were computed using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH) with 1,000 replicates. Structural alignment of reference or retrieved Mtases were done using EXPRESSO [26] and proofed with Chimera [27] . N7-Mtases reference motifs were inferred and defined based on visual inspection and analysis of the structures. The subsequent motifs were used as orthogonal validation and not used for the search.
Sequences were analyzed using HHblits and HHpred tools of the BioInformatics tookit ( [28] ). When available, authentic cleavage sites were used to predict protein gene products of the Orf1ab, Orf1a, and Orf1b polyproteins. The boundaries were otherwise approximately (+/-10 aa) determined using structural homologies detected using HHPred, except for the N-term boundary of the Orf1b gene product: In Nidovirales, the absence of any structural data nor homology (outside the order) on the N-terminus of the RdRp gene (nsp9 Arteriviridae, nsp12 in Coronaviridae), which was used for phylogenic analysis, precludes precise sequence homology search in this limited area comprised between the nsp10 and nsp12 proteins (Coronavirus gene-product naming).
Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were generated using Muscle in SeaView [29] . For each sequence of unknown structure, secondary structures were predicted using Predict Protein [30] . The predicted secondary structures were used to validate the alignment with structural references. The MSA was rendered using ESPript 3.0 [31] , together with appropriate structural models as indicated, to assign secondary structures. When possible, structural 3D models were generated using Phyre 2.0 [32] . Conserved patches of amino-acids were generated using WebLogo [33] and mapped in the structural models rendered in Chimera.
Available Nidovirales genome sequences were used to analyze the presence and primary structure of RNA MTases. Any RF-MTase signature sequence is detectable mainly due to the presence of a typical G-X-G-(X)n-G element part of a SAM-binding motif [34, 35] , whereas the detection of viral NRF-MTases is based on its homology to the MTase domain of Coronavirus nsp14. We made use of the conserved RdRp fold to build a phylogenetic tree along the whole order. From this tree, we first determined that most of Nidovirales code for at least one RF-MTase protein with the canonical K-D-K E catalytic tetrad of 2'O MTase ( Fig.1 green & Table 1 ). Conversely, as previously reported, this RF-2'O MTase is lacking in EAV, LDV, and PRRSV in the Arteriviridae family. Interestingly, we identified two RF-MTase signature sequences in the genomes of two recently identified arteri-like viruses: the Hainan Hebius Popei Arterivirus (HHPAV, 12,496 nt) and the Nanhai gost shark arterivirus (NGSAV, 13,162 nt). Their genomes carry a bona fide RF-2'-O-MTase signature sequence at the end of their Orf1b, in the gene order RdRp-Hel-(ExoN*)-EndoU-2'OMTase. The NGSAV does not carry a detectable ExoN signature sequence, whereas the HHPAV genome carries a nsp14-like ExoN domain coding region but not a detectable C-terminus NRF-MTase domain, hence the ExoN* labeling (Ferron, Decroly & Canard, unpublished) . All these RF-MTase with the K-D-K-E signature are localized in a conserved genomic position at the 3' end of the Orf1ab, much like their CoV and nsp16 homologues. We performed a MSA of nsp16 from Roniviridae and Tobaniviridae (Fig. 1 , in green), followed by modeling a typical representative of these nsp16 (not shown). All these nsp16-like enzymes appear to be predicted as canonical RNA 2'-O MTases with a typical K-D-K-E tetrad. As noted by others in the Ronivirus nsp16 model [16] , small structural differences are observed across the Tobaniviridae family, such as the absence of β3 strand and a shorter loop upstream helix αD. Thus, we conclude that non-arterivirus Nidovirales code for a RF-MTase with the canonical K-D-K E catalytic tetrad of 2'-O MTase, and that these enzymes are distributed in similar position along genomes.
As indicated above, many Nidovirales members, such as SARS-CoV, stand out because they possess a NRF-MTase, participating to cap N7-guanine methylation, embedded at the Cterminus of their nsp14 gene product. It have been previously reported that the N7-guanine-MTase domain is not uniformly present in nsp14-containing nidoviruses [21] . The phylogenetic tree of Figure 1 reports our findings, and confirms that coronaviruses and most mesoniviruses only possess signature-sequences lining the SAM binding site seen in the nsp14 MTase domain structure. Conversely, the other members of the Nidovirales order (Arteriviridae, Medionivirdae, Roniviridae, Euroniviridae, Abyssoviridae, Mononiviridae and Tobaniviridae) do not seem to embed any nsp14-like NRF-MTase. Two notable exceptions are apparent: First, the unique members of Abyssoviridae, Mononiviridae do possess a MTase signature-sequence at the C-terminus of their nsp14-like gene, (i.e., fused to the ExoN domain). Curiously, though, this MTase is readily detectable using HH-Pred as a RF-MTase which does qualify neither as a K-D-K-E 2'-O MTase nor as a N7-guanine MTase (see below). Second, the Fathead Minnow nidovirus 1, belonging to the Tobaniviridae, is also an exception as we detected a nsp14-like NRF MTase at the expected genomic Orf1b position. Against, based on the homology with the nsp14-like MTase domain characterized by the absence of K-D-K-E catalytic residue and NRF folding, we hypothesize that these enzymes might play a role in guanine N7 methylation of the RNA cap structure. Apart from coronaviruses and most mesoniviruses, how nidoviruses methylate their RNA-cap N7-guanine position is thus still unclear.
Unlike 2'-O MTases and their well-defined K-D-K-E tetrad, and apart from NRF nsp14-like MTases, signature sequences of RNA cap N7-guanine cap N7-guanosine MTases are much less obvious. The wealth of structural data and mechanistic insight on the N7-guanine MTases enzymes has been acquired from the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi [36] , the poxvirus MTase D1:D12 heterodimer [37] and Reoviridae [38, 39] in the case of RNA viruses. There are only three crystal structure of RF-MTase known to methylate N7-guanine RNA caps of RNA viruses : those of Reoviridae (Rotavirus VP4 and Reovirus Lambda2), and Flavivirus, whose NS5 N-terminus domain is a bi-functional N7-guanine and 2'O-MTase [40] . Taking together these data, and combining structural information with the human RNA N7-guanine methyltransferase crystal structure (PDB ID: 3BGV), one cannot define a specific N7-guanine MTase signature (Fig. S1 ). From this analysis and others [35] it is clear that the structure conservation prevailed over sequence conservation. No amino acid motifs typical of an RNA N7-guanine MTase can be clearly identified (Fig. S1) . A narrower structural comparison including only Encephalitozoon cuniculi, poxvirus and the human RNA N7-guanine MTase allows detection of 6 amino acids or motifs K / G/D/ HY / E / Y (Fig. S2 ). Typical SAM binding motifs are defined by a combination of 3 motifs placed at specific structural positions: K within an α helix, followed by a GxGxG motif within a loop and conserved D. The 3 latter motifs are located in the MTase structural pocket where the N7 methylation supposedly occurs. In order to use an independent method, we performed a structural search using HHpred on PDB and SCOPe databases [41] , using each sequence as a query. This allowed to refine the boundaries of the MTase domain. The structure with the closest hit is a SAM-dependent MTase from Pectobacterium atrosepticum and then Encephalitozoon cuniculi. A quick superimposition of the retrieved structures with N7-guanine MTase shows that these structures can be structurally aligned but with very limited sequence conservation. Surprisingly, apart from a conserved leucine residue 2 amino acid upstream the poorly conserved SAM binding motif (only the third G is strictly conserved) and a glycine-rich motifs in the fifth beta sheet, nothing else is conserved nor defines an active site (Fig. S3 ). Taking these criteria into account, there was no obvious indication of RF N7-guanine MTase features in Nidovirales other than the two mentioned above in Abyssoviridae and Mononiviridae. Currently, based on the detection of RF-MTase fold, one can infer a 2' O-MTase sequence signature when the K-D-K-E tetrad is present, but not a RNA-cap N7guanine MTase.
Then, how do Roniviridae and Tobaniviridae methylate the RNA-cap N7-guanine position? One possibility would be that these nsp16-like were bi-functional, carrying both 2'-O and N7guanine methylation activity such as evidenced in Flavivirus NS5 protein, with no obvious signature sequence of this bi-functionality. Another possibility would be that another gene author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We thus performed a larger search of MTase signature-sequences along the whole Orf1ab in all Nidovirales: surprisingly, a RF-MTase signature-sequence was detected in Orf1a of 10 members of the Tobaniviridae family (Fig. 2) . Strictly conserved amino-acids in these new viral MTases define three motifs: 3 glycines of the SAM binding site (G54, 56, and 58 in WBV) 2 residues downstream of a 3 amino acid hydrophobic patches in a β-strand structure, a histidine (H117 immediately followed by either F or Y, and Glu175 (Fig. S4) . Interestingly the catalytic K-D-K-E tetrad associated to 2'O-MTase is lacking, suggesting that they could correspond to the missing RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase.
Remarkably, the novel Orf1a MTase gene was associated with reptiles and fish. Nonetheless, in two cases (Xinzhou Nematode virus 6 and Xinzhou toro-like virus 1, from the Sectovirus 1 and Infratovirus 1 species respectively), the viruses were isolated from snakeassociated nematodes, although their proper host and life style has not been clearly assessed. The mammalian toroviruses (EToV, BToV, Bovine TCH5 nidovirus, GToV and PToV) do not carry the MTase signature sequence, and thus the latter is associated so far to nonmammalian Tobaniviridae.
We performed a structure-based alignment of this Orf1a MTase with the integration of several structurally-defined eukaryotic RNA-cap N7-guanine MTases (Fig. 3A) , of which Ecm1 can be considered as prototypic [36] . The conserved amino-acids in these new MTase set remain essentially the same: two glycines of the SAM binding site (G54 and 56 in WBV, G74-76 in Ecm1), a histidine (H117 in WBV, H144 in Ecm1) immediately followed by either F or Y. Glu175 is also very conserved, and in the Ecm1 structure, its homosteric counterpart Glu225 is positioned close to His144 and interacts also with the guanine base, strongly suggesting that this MTase is an N7-guanine MTase. The alignment allows to define 5 conserved motifs which are represented in Fig. 3B , and structurally aligned onto the vaccinia N7-guanine MTase structure D12 (PDB: 4KCB). author/funder.

RNA virus cap-MTases perform two types of reactions: the methylation of the N7-guanine of the RNA cap, and the methylation of the adenosine 2'-O ribose of the first transcribed nucleotide [6] . Regarding the guanine methylation, this reaction can also be achieved on a GTP molecule before capping, in some virus families, and the N7-methyl GTP is then used to cap the RNA [42] . This is the case with the alphavirus nsp1 enzyme, whose structure is currently unknown. Conversely, several crystal structures of viral enzymes involved in N7guanine methylation of RNA caps have been reported, such as that of flaviviruses (NS5, [43] ), rotaviruses and reoviruses (VP4 and lambda2, respectively [38, 39] ), and coronaviruses (nsp14, [11, 12] ).
The viral 2'-O MTases have been better defined than N7-guanine MTases at the structural and functional level. They all use a K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad, and crystal structures have been determined for several virus groups, such as Reovirus, Flavivirus, Coronavirus, and Mononegavirales (reviewed in [6] , [44] ). All these enzymes (N7-and 2'O-MTase), with SARS-CoV nsp14 as a notable exception (see below), belong to the Rossmann-fold (RF) type MTase (reviewed in [34, 35] ). They bind the methyl donor (SAM), and are characterized by several structural features: their Rossmann fold is a seven-strands β-sheet surrounded with 6 α-helices; the seventh β-strand is inserted in an anti-parallel orientation between the 5th and 6th strand. The SAM cofactor binds to the first structural motif βαβ, which bears the amino acid sequence motif G-x-G-(x) n -G. The RF is an evolutionary ancient fold, which has been widely evolved to perform a variety of chemical reactions. Its structural plasticity is well illustrated by the Flavivirus NS5 MTase, which is able to perform both N7-guanine and 2'-O ribose methylation with the same ~33 kDa domain fused at the N-terminus of the viral RdRp domain [40] .
The presence of a MTase in Nidovirales Orf1a is unexpected, and had not been reported before, although signature sequences of an uncharacterized MTase had been detected in Ball Python nidovirus, Sectovirus 1 and Infratovirus 1 [23] . Both protein and enzyme functions in Nidovirales have been classified into a functional triangle [21] , each side of the triangle representing a carrier of the following functions: Orf1a: host defence; Orf1b: genome maintenance; Orfs at the 3'-end: structural products. In this triangle, the MTase-type of activity involved in genome maintenance would usually map to Orf1b [21] . Perhaps indeed this MTase is involved in tasks other than RNA capping, which remain to be determined. Accordingly, it was recently reported that viral or cellular MTases can be recruited by viruses in order to induce internal methylation of their genome [45] and escape to the antiviral response mediated by MDA5 [46] . Out of the gain of this (still putative) enzyme activity in this virus group, the copy number of Orf1a products is expected to be 3-6 time higher than those of Orf1b, raising the following questions: why only these Tobaniviridae members need such additional MTase ? Why do they need it in high amounts, provided that the Orf1a stoichiometry is thought to be higher than that of Orf1b products? Are activity levels provided by this enzyme low? What is its actual substrate specificity?
Also, it is legitimate to question the specificity of single copy MTases in Nidovirales, such as mammalian Tobaniviridae or Roniviridae (Fig. 2 ). Since they do not have any obvious RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase, how is RNA-cap methylation achieved, if any? Are their nsp16-like enzymes of broad or promiscuous specificity?
Our work also uncovers an unexpected 2'-O MTase distribution in viruses seemingly blurring the contour of Arteriviridae, a discovery that, in turn, may have a significant impact on our understanding of genome size evolution in Nidovirales.

In any case, the type, diversity, and distribution of RNA MTases along the Nidovirales deserves a closer look : SAM-dependent MTases are ancient folds associated with RNA stability and evolution [47] . Their presence and properties in a phylogenetic tree may well give interesting clues regarding RNA genome evolution and its associated issue of host defense mechanisms.

0e38333bff68345492526fd39b70d1b18969cb83,"Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment. Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weaklysupervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and highperformance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. The developed deep learning software is available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection.","huge amount of efforts for radiologists, which is not acceptable when COVID-19 is spreading fastly and there are great shortages for radiologists. Thus, performing COVID-19 detection in a weakly-supervised manner is of great importance. One of the simplest labels for COVID-19 detection is the patient-level, i.e., indicating the patient is COVID-19 positive or negative. Therefore, aim of current study was to investigate the potential of a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT volumes using the weak patient-level label, for the sake of rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 at this critical situation to help to counter this outbreak, especially within Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
Patients This retrospective study was approved by Huazhong University of Science and Technology ethics committee, patient consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of this study.
Between Dec. 13, 2019 to Feb. 6, 2020, we searched unenhanced chest CT scans of patients with suspected COVID-19 from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) of radiology department (Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology). Finally, 540 patients (mean age, 42.5±16.1 years; range, 3-81 years, male 226, female 314) were enrolled into this study, including 313 patients (mean age, 50.7±14.7 years; range, 8-81 years; male 138, female 175) with clinical diagnosed COVID-19 (COVID-positive group) and 229 patients (mean age, 31.2±10.0 years; range, 3-69 years; male 88, female 141) without COVID-19 (COVID-negative group). There was no significant difference in sex between the two groups (χ 2 =1.744; P=0.187), age in COVIDpositive group significantly higher than that of COVID-negative group (t=17.09; P<0.001). The main clinical symptoms for these patients were fever, cough, fatigue, and diarrhea. Of all the patients, two were included by both groups due to the first and second follow-up CT scans. The first case (female, year 66) was diagnosed as COVID-19 negative on Jan 24, 2020, then changed into COVID-positive on Feb 6, 2020; the second case (female, year 23) was diagnosed as COVID-19 positive on Jan 24, 2020, then changed into COVID-negative on Feb 3, 2020. All the CT volumes scanned on and before Jan 23, 2020, were assigned for deep learning training, and all the CT volumes scanned after Jan 23, 2020, were assigned for deep learning testing.
The CT scanning of all the enrolled patients was performed on a gemstone CT scanner (GE Discovery CT750HD; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), and were positioned in a headfirst supine position, with their bilateral arms raised and placed beside bilateral ears. All the patients underwent CT scans during the end-inspiration without the administration of contrast material. Related parameters for chest CT scanning were listed as follows: field of view (FOV), 36 cm; tube voltage, 100 kV; tube current, 350 mA; noise index, 13; helical mode; section thickness, 5 mm; slice interval, 5 mm; pitch, 1.375; collimation 64×0.625 mm; gantry rotation speed, 0.7 s; matrix, 512×512; the reconstruction slice thickness 1 mm with an interval of 0.8 mm; scan rage from apex to lung base; the mediastinal window: window width of 200 HU with a window level of 35 HU, and the lung window: window width of 1500 HU with a window level of -700 HU.

COVID-19 has been regarded as current standard for clinical diagnostic cases in severely affected areas only in Hubei Province, indicating that chest CT is fundamental for COVID-19 identification of clinically diagnosed cases.
Typical CT findings for COVID-19 are also listed: multifocal small patchy shadowing and interstitial abnormalities in the early stage, especially for the peripheral area of the bilateral lungs. In the progressive period, the lesions could increase in range and in number; it could develop into multiple ground glass opacity (GGO) with further infiltration into the bilateral lungs. In severe cases, pulmonary diffuse consolidation may occur and pleural effusion is rarely shown.
The combination of epidemiologic features (travel or contact history), clinical signs and symptoms, chest CT, laboratory findings and real-time RT-PCR (if available) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is used for the final identification of COVID-19. The medical CT reports were acquired via the electronic medical record of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. According to the CT reports, if a CT scan was COVID-positive, its ground-truth label was 1; otherwise, the label was 0. Figure 1 : Architecture of the proposed DeCoVNet. The network took a CT volume with its 3D lung mask as input and directly output the probabilities of COVID-positive and COVID-negative.
The Proposed DeCoVNet We proposed a 3D deep convolutional neural Network to Detect COVID-19 (DeCoVNet) from CT volumes. As shown in Fig. 1 , DeCoVNet took a CT volume and its 3D lung mask as input. The 3D lung mask was generated by a pre-trained UNet [19] . DeCoVNet was divided into three stages for a clear illustration in Table. 1. The first stage was the network stem, which consisted of a vanilla 3D convolution with a kernel size of 5 × 7 × 7, a batchnorm layer and a pooling layer. The second stage was composed of two 3D residual blocks (ResBlocks). In each ResBlock, a 3D feature map was passed into both a 3D convolution with a batchnorm layer and a shortcut connection containing a 3D convolution that was omitted in Fig. 1 for dimension alignment. The resulted feature maps were added in an element-wise manner. The third stage was a progressive classifier (ProClf), which mainly contained three 3D convolution layers and a fully-connected (FC) layer with the softmax activation function. ProClf progressively abstracts the information in the CT volumes by 3D max-pooling and finally directly output the probabilities of being COVID-positive and COVID-negative. The 3D lung mask of an input chest CT volume helped to reduce background information and better detect COVID-19. Detecting the 3D lung mask was a well-studied issue. In this study, we trained a simple 2D UNet using the CT images in our training set. To obtain the ground-truth lung masks, we 4 .

The input size is 2 × T × 192 × 288. segmented the lung regions using an unsupervised learning method [20] , removed the failure cases manually, and the rest segmentation results were taken as ground-truth masks. The 3D lung mask of each CT volume was obtained by testing the trained 2D UNet frame-by-frame without using any temporal information. The overall training and testing procedures of UNet and DeCoVNet for COVID-19 detection were illustrated in Fig. 2 .
Preprocessing of 2D UNet All the CT volumes were preprocessed in a unified manner before training the 2D UNet for lung segmentation. First, the unit of measurement was converted to the Hounsfield Unit (HU) and the value was linearly normalized from 16-bit to 8-bit (i.e., 0-255) after determining the threshold of a HU window (e.g., -1 200-600 HU). After that, all the CT volumes were resampled into a same spatial resolution (e.g., 368×368), by which the CT volumes could be aligned without the influence of the cylindrical scanning bounds of CT scanners. This step was applied to the obtained ground-truth lung masks as well.
Preprocessing of DeCoVNet For each CT volume, the lung masks produced by the trained UNet formed a mask volume, then the CT volume was concatenated with the mask volume to obtain a CT-Mask volume. Finally, the CT-Mask volume was resampled into a fixed spatial resolution (e.g., 224×336) without changing the number of slices for DeCoVNet training and testing. The number of slices in the whole dataset was 141±16 ranging from 73 to 250.
Data Augmentation To avoid the overfitting problem since the number of training CT volumes was limited, online data augmentation strategies were applied including random affine transformation and color jittering. The affine transformation was composed of rotation (0 • ±10 • ), horizontal and vertical 5 .

The color jittering adjusted brightness (0%±50%) and contrast (0%±30%). For each training sample, the parameters were randomly generated and the augmentation was identically applied for each slice in the sampled CT volume.
Training and Testing Procedures The DeCoVNet software was developed based on the PyTorch framework [21] . Our proposed DeCoVNet was trained in an end-to-end manner, which meant that the CT volumes were provided as input and only the final output was supervised without any manual intervention. The network was trained for 100 epochs using Adam optimizer [22] with a constant learning rate of 1e-5. Because the length of CT volume of each patient was not fixed, the batch size was set to 1. The binary cross-entropy loss function was used to calculate the loss between predictions and ground-truth labels.
During the procedure of testing, data augmentation strategies were not applied. The trained DeCoV-Net took the preprocessed CT-Mask volume of each patient and output the COVID-positive probability as well as COVID-negative probability. Then the predicted probabilities of all patients and their corresponding ground-truth labels were collected for statistical analysis.
The cohort for studying the COVID-19 detection contained 630 CT scans collected from Dec 13, 2019 to Feb 6, 2020. To simulate the process of applying the proposed DeCoVNet for clinical computeraided diagnosis (i.e., prospective clinical trials), we used the 499 CT scans collected from Dec 13, 2019 to Jan 23, 2020 for training and used the rest 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020 to Feb. 06, 6 .

Statistical Analysis COVID-19 detection results were reported and analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves. The area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (PR AUC) were calculated. Besides, multiple operating points were chosen on the ROC curve, e.g., the points with approximately 0.95 sensitivity (high sensitivity point) and with approximately 0.95 specificity (high specificity point). ROC AUC, PR AUC, and some key operating points were used to assess the deep learning algorithm.
This was a retrospective case series study and no patients were involved in the study design, setting the research questions, or the outcome measures directly. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. The software for COVID-19 detection with the pre-trained model as well as the results was available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection, which will be made publicly available on the publication of this paper. Training DeCoVNet on the training set which consisted of 499 CT volumes took about 20 hours (11 hours for UNet and 9 hours for DeCoVNet) and testing a CT volume costed an average of 1.93 seconds (1.80 seconds for UNet and 0.13 seconds for DeCoVNet) on an NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU.

For every testing CT scan, we used the trained DeCoVNet to predict its probability of COVID-19. By comparing with their binary ground-truth labels, we plotted ROC and PR curves as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 respectively. In the ROC, we obtained a ROC AUC value of 0.959. When true positive rate (TPR, i.e., sensitivity) was approximately 0.95, our model obtained a true negative rate (TNR, i.e., specificity) of 0.786; when TNR was approximately 0.95, our model obtained a TPR of 0.880; there was another operating showed that our algorithm obtained both TPR and FPR larger than 0.9, i.e., sensitivity=0.907 and specificity=0.911. On the PR curve, our model obtained a PR AUC of 0.975.
When using the threshold of 0.5 to make COVID-19 detection prediction (i.e., if the probability of COVID-19 was larger than 0.5, the patient was classified as COVID-positive, and vice versa), the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901 with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.840 and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.982. By varying the probability threshold, we obtained a series of COVID-19 detection accuracy, PPV and NPV in Table 2 . Our data showed that the COVID-19 prediction accuracy obtained by the DeCoVNet algorithm was higher than 0.9 when the threshold ranged from 0.2 to 0.5. At the threshold setting of 0.5, there were 12 false positive predictions in total and only one false positive prediction by the algorithm in our study, indicating that the algorithm to have a very high negative predictive value.
The accurate predictions (a true positive and a true negative) were presented in Fig. 5 (A-B) , and erroneous predictions in Fig. 5 (C-F) . In images corresponding to the true positive and the false negative, the lesions of COVID-19 were annotated by red arrows. As shown in Fig. 5 (C, D, E) , the false negative predictions were made by the algorithm, and Fig. 5 (F) showed the only false positive prediction, in which the respiratory artifact had been mistaken as a COVID-19 lesion by the DeCoVNet algorithm.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform weakly-supervised computer-aided COVID-19 detection with a large number of CT volumes from the frontline hospital at the present epidemic period. By designing an effective weakly-supervised deep learning-based algorithm and training it on CT volumes collected before Jan 23, 2020 with only patient-level labels, the testing results on 131 CT scans collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were very impressive, e.g., the PR AUC value was 0.975. On the ROC curve, the algorithm obtained sensitivity and specificity values larger than 0.9, which were both clinically applicable.
The motivation of this study was to utilize AI to alleviate the problem of shortage of professional interpretations for CT images when the epidemic is still fast spreading. Though there were many effective applications of medical AI in previous studies [13, 23] , developing AI for automatic COVID-19 detection was still a challenging task. Firstly, in the current emergency situation, the number of enrolled patients is relatively smaller compared with that used in previous studies [13, 23] ; and patients enrolled in our study were clinically diagnosed cases with COVID-19, because the majority of them did not undergo the nucleic acid testing due to the sudden outbreak and limited medical resource in such a short time period. Secondly, the lesions of COVID-19 in CT volumes were not labeled by radiologists and only patientlevel labels (i.e., COVID-positive or COVID-negative) were utilized for training the AI algorithm in our study. Thirdly, some small infected areas of COVID-19 have the potential to be missed even by professional radiologists, and whether it is feasible to be detected by deep learning-based 3D DCNN model remains unclear. We hypothesized to solve these problems by proposing a delicate 3D DCNN, i.e., DeCoVNet. It solved the first problem by applying extensive data augmentation on training CT volumes to obtain more training examples. The second problem was solved by regarding the COVID-19 detection problem as a weakly-supervised learning problem [24] , i.e., detecting COVID-19 without annotating the regions of COVID-19 lesions. In the designed DeCoVNet, we used the spatially global pooling layer and the temporally global pooling layer to technically handle the weakly-supervised COVID-19 detection problem. The third problem was addressed by taking the advantages of deep learning and utilizing a pre-trained UNet for providing the lung masks to guide the learning of DeCoVNet.
The deep learning-based COVID-19 diagnostic algorithm used in our study is effective compared to recent deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis methods. On the task of predicting the risk of lung cancer [13] , the deep learning model was trained on 42290 CT cases from 14851 patients and obtained 0.944 ROC AUC. On the task of critical findings from head CT [23] , the deep learning model was trained on 310055 head CT scans and obtained ROC AUC of 0.920. In our study, only 499 scans were used for training, but the obtained ROC AUC was 0.959. By comparing the data between them, it was able to find that the task of COVID-19 detection may be easier and the proposed deep learning algorithm was very powerful. As for the erroneous 12 false negative predictions in our results, the most possible explanations after we rechecked the original CT images were listed as follows: those lesions were slightly increased in CT densities, and images of those ground-glass opacities were very faint without consolidation.
Our study provided a typical and successful solution for developing medical AI for emerging diseases, such as COVID-19. While we were developing this AI, doctors in Wuhan were still extremely busy with treating a huge number of COVID-19 patients and it may be impossible for them to annotate the lesions in CT volumes in the current austere fight against this epidemic. Thanks to the weaklysupervised algorithm in this study, locations of pulmonary lesions in CT volumes are not necessary to be annotated, and radiologists' annotating efforts can be minimized, i.e., only providing patient-level labels. Therefore, developing a helpful AI tool swiftly has become possible and available in the clinical application. In the future, the burden of AI experts could be lifted significantly by automatic machine learning (AutoML) [25] .
Limitations of this study There are still several limitations in this study. First, network design and training may be further improved. For example, the UNet model for lung segmentation did not utilize temporal information and it was trained using imperfect ground-truth masks, which could be improved by using 3D segmentation networks and adopting precise ground-truth annotated by experts. Second, the data used in this study came from a single hospital and cross-center validations were not performed. Third, when diagnosing COVID-19, the algorithm worked in a black-box manner, since the algorithm was based on deep learning and its explainability was still at an early stage. Related work of all limitations mentioned above will be addressed in our further studies.
In conclusion, without the need for annotating the COVID-19 lesions in CT volumes for training, our weakly-supervised deep learning algorithm obtained strong COVID-19 detection performance. Therefore, our algorithm has great potential to be applied in clinical application for accurate and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis, which is of great help for the frontline medical staff and is also vital to control this epidemic worldwide.",Deep Learning-based Detection for COVID-19 from Chest CT using Weak Label,medrxiv,10.1101/2020.03.12.20027185,,,medrvix,2020-03-17,Chuansheng Zheng; Xianbo Deng; Qing Fu; Qiang Zhou; Jiapei Feng; Hui Ma; Wenyu Liu; Xinggang Wang,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv
0eda8331214ca028350b07e2953702f3078a105e,"Estimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection.
Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness.
We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented .

Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3 .00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably.
A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.
The novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 quickly spread to all Chinese provinces and, as of February 6, 2020, to 24 other countries 1, 2 . Efforts to contain the virus are ongoing; however, given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and virulence, the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown.
The fraction of undocumented but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates the pandemic potential of an emergent respiratory virus 3−6 . These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to virus than would otherwise occur. Here, to assess the full potential of COVID-19, we use a modelinference framework to estimate the contagiousness and proportion of undocumented infections in China during the weeks before and after the shutdown of travel in and out of Wuhan.
We developed a mathematical model that simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of infections among 375 Chinese cities. The model incorporates information on human movement within the following metapopulation structure: [5] where < , < , < A , < B and < are the susceptible, exposed, documented infected, undocumented infected and total population in city i. Note that we define patients with symptoms severe enough to be confirmed as documented infected individuals; whereas other infected persons are defined as undocumented infected individuals. We specified a rate parameter, β, for the transmission rate due to documented infected individuals. The transmission rate due to undocumented individuals is reduced by a factor . In addition, is the fraction of documented infections, Z is the average latency period and D is the average duration of infection. The effective reproduction number ( 4 ) is calculated as 4 = + (1 − ) (see Supplementary Appendix for details). Spatial coupling within the model is represented by the daily number of people traveling from city j to city i ( <3 ) and a multiplicative factor, , which is greater than 1 to reflect underreporting of human movements (see below). We assume that individuals in the < A group do not move between cities. A similar metapopulation model has been used to forecast the spatial transmission of influenza in the United States 7 .
Daily numbers of travelers between 375 Chinese cities during the Spring Festival period (""Chunyun"") were derived from human mobility data collected by the Tencent Location-based Service (LBS) during the 2018 Chunyun period (February 1 -March 12, 2018) 8 . Chunyun is a period of 40 days -15 days before and 25 days after the Lunar New Year -during which there are high rates of travel within China. To estimate human mobility during the 2020 Chunyun period, which began January 10, we aligned the 2018 Tencent data based on relative timing to the Spring Festival. For example, we used mobility data from February 1, 2018 to represent human movement on January 10, 2020, as these days were similarly distant from the Lunar New Year. During the 2018 Chunyun, a total of 1.73 billion travel events were captured in the Tencent data; whereas 2.97 billions trips are reported 8 . To reconcile these two numbers, we include the parameter in the model system.
To infer COVID-19 transmission dynamics during the early stage of the outbreak, we simulated observations from January 10-23, 2020 (i.e. the period before the initiation of travel restrictions) using an iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) framework [9] [10] [11] . With this combined model-inference system, we estimated the trajectories of the four model state variables ( < , < , < A , < B ) for all 375 cities, while simultaneously inferring the six model parameters (Z, D, , , , ). The initial prior ranges of the model parameters were drawn from uniform distributions of the following ranges: 2 ≤ ≤ 5 , 2 ≤ ≤ 5 , 0.2 ≤ ≤ 1, 0.6 ≤ ≤ 1.5, 0.02 ≤ ≤ 0.8, 1 ≤ ≤ 1.75.
For the outbreak origin, Wuhan city, the initial exposed population, VBWXY , and initial undocumented infected population, VBWXY B , were drawn from a uniform distribution [0, \X] ]. The documented infected population in Wuhan VBWXY A on January 10 was set to zero. Although infections were reported prior to January 10, these cases were sporadic and the EAKF adjustment can account for the effects of these early infections (by selecting elevated exposed and unreported infection levels). For other cities, we defined < as the number of travelers from Wuhan to city on the first day of Chunyun. The initial exposed, documented infected and undocumented infected populations were set to < = < VBWXY / VBWXY , < A = 0 and <
To account for delays in infection confirmation, we also defined an observation model using a Poisson process. Specifically, for each new case in group < A , a reporting delay ! (in days) was generated from a Poisson distribution with a mean value of ! . In fitting both synthetic and the observed outbreaks, we performed simulations with the model-inference system using different fixed values of ! (4 ≤ ! ≤ 12 ) and \X] (500 ≤ \X] ≤ 6000). The best fitting model-inference posterior was identified by log-likelihood. Full details of the data and methods, including synthetic testing and sensitivity analyses, are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Finally, we also modelled the transmission of COVID-19 in China after January 23, when greater control measures were effected. These control measures included travel restrictions imposed between major cities and Wuhan; self-quarantine and contact precautions advocated by the government; and more available rapid testing for infection confirmation [12] [13] . These measures along with changes in medical careseeking behaviour due to increased awareness of the virus and increased personal protective behavior (e.g. wearing of facemasks, social distancing, self-isolation when sick), likely altered the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak after January 23. To quantify these differences, we re-estimated the system parameters using the metapopulation model-inference framework and city-level daily cases reported between January 24 and February 8. As inter-city mobility was restricted, we set = 0. In addition, to represent reduced person-to-person contact and increased infection detection, we updated the initial priors for and to [0.2, 1.0] and [0.2, 1.0], respectively (see Supplementary Appendix for more details).
We first tested the model-inference framework using synthetic outbreaks generated by the model in free simulation. These simulations verified the ability of the modelinference framework to simultaneously estimate the six target model parameters (see Supplementary Appendix, Figures S1-S8) .
We next applied the system to the observed outbreak before the travel restrictions of January 23 -a total of 811 documented cases throughout China. Figure 1 shows simulations of reported cases generated using the best-fitting model parameter estimates. The distribution of these stochastic simulations captures the range of observed cases well. In addition, the best-fitting model captures the spread of COVID-19 to other cities in China ( Figure S9 ). Our median estimate of the overall 4 is 2.23 (95% CI: 1.77−3.00), indicating a high capacity for sustained transmission of COVID-19 (Table 1) . This finding aligns with other recent estimates of the reproductive number for this time period 6, [12] [13] [14] . In addition, the median estimates for the latent and infectious periods are approximately 3.77 and 3.45 days, respectively. Further, we find that, during January 10-23, only 14% (95% CI: 9-26%) of total infections in China were reported. This estimate reveals a very high rate of undocumented infections: 86%. This finding is independently corroborated by the infection rate among foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan (see Supplementary Appendix). These undocumented infections are estimated to have been half as contagious per individual as reported infections (µ = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.44 -0.69). Other model fittings made using alternate values of ! and \X] produced similar parameter estimates ( Figure S10 ).
Using the best-fitting model ( To highlight further this impact of contagious, undocumented COVID-19 infections on overall transmission and reported case counts, we generated a set of hypothetical outbreaks using the best-fitting parameter estimates but with = 0, i.e. the undocumented infections are no longer contagious (Figure 2) . We find that without transmission from undocumented cases, reported infections during January 10-23 are reduced 66.4% across all of China and 64.0% in Wuhan. Further, there are fewer cities with more than 8 cumulative documented cases: only 1 city with more than 8 documented cases versus the 10 observed by January 23 (Figure 2 ). This finding indicates that contagious, undocumented infections facilitated the geographic spread of COVID-19 within China.
The results of inference for the January 24-February 8 period are presented in Table  2 , Figure S11 and Table S1 . Control measures are continually shifting, so we show estimates for both January 24 -February 3 (Period 1) and January 24 -February 8 (Period 2). The best-fitting model for both periods has a reduced reporting delay, ! , of 5 days (vs. 10 days before January 23), consistent with more rapid confirmation of infections. Estimates of both the latency and infectious periods are relatively unchanged; however, , and 4 have all shifted considerably. The contact rate, , drops to 0.51 (95% CI: 0.39 -0.69) during Period 1 and 0.34 (95% CI: 0.27 -0.48) during Period 2, less than half the estimate prior to travel restrictions. The reporting rate, , is estimated to be 0.71 (95% CI: 0.55 -0.85), i.e. 71% of infections are documented during Period 1, up from 0.14 prior to travel restrictions, and is nearly the same in Period 2. The reproductive number is 1.51 (95% CI: 1.17 -2.10) during Period 1 and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.73 -1.38) during Period 2, down from 2.23 prior to travel restrictions. While the estimate for the relative transmission rate, , is similar to before January 23, the contagiousness of undocumented infections, represented by , is substantially reduced, possibly reflecting that only very mild and asymptomatic infections remain undocumented.
Our findings indicate that a large proportion of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to the implementation of travel restrictions and other heightened control measures in China on January 23, and that a large proportion of the total force of infection was mediated through these undocumented infections (Table 1) . This high proportion of undocumented infections, many of whom were likely not severely symptomatic, appears to have supported the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. Indeed, suppression of the infectiousness of these undocumented cases in model simulations reduces the total number of documented cases and the overall spread of COVID-19 (Figure 2 ).
Our findings also indicate that a radical increase in the identification and isolation of currently undocumented infections would be needed to fully control COVID-19.
Increased news coverage and awareness of the virus in the general population have already likely prompted increased rates of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms. In addition, awareness among healthcare providers, public health officials and the availability of viral identification assays suggest that capacity for identifying previously missed infections has increased. Further, general population and government response efforts have increased the use of face masks, restricted travel, delayed school reopening and isolated suspected persons, all of which could additionally slow the spread of COVID-19.
Combined, these measures are expected to increase reporting rates, reduce the proportion of undocumented infections, and decrease the growth and spread of infection. Indeed, estimation of the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak after January 23, indicate that government control efforts and population awareness have reduced the rate of spread of the virus (i.e. lower , , 4 ) and increased the reporting rate. The overall reduction of the effective reproductive number is encouraging; however, the control efforts have yet to critically and clearly reduce 4 below 1.
Importantly, the situation on the ground in China is changing day-to-day. New travel restrictions and control measures are being imposed on new populations in different cities, and these rapidly varying effects make certain estimation of the epidemiological characteristics for the outbreak difficult. Further, reporting inaccuracies and changing care-seeking behavior add another level of uncertainty to our estimations. While the data and findings presented here indicate that travel restrictions and control measures have reduced COVID-19 transmission considerably, whether these controls are sufficient for reducing 4 below 1 for the length of time needed to eliminate the disease locally and prevent a rebound outbreak once control measures are relaxed is unclear. Further, similar control measures and travel restrictions would have to be implemented outside China to prevent re-introduction of the virus.
Our findings underscore the seriousness and pandemic potential of COVID-19. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus also caused many mild cases, quickly spread globally, and eventually became endemic. Presently, there are four, endemic, coronavirus strains currently circulating in human populations (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43). If the novel coronavirus follows the pattern of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, it will also spread globally and become a fifth endemic coronavirus within the human population.
Many characteristics of the COVID-19 remain unknown or uncertain. Consequently, care should be taken when interpreting our estimates. For instance, after January 23, we assume a complete travel shutdown with no inter-city human mobility; however, the degree and initial date of travel restrictions has varied among cities. Our estimates may therefore represent an upper-bound of the potential impact of travel restriction on COVID-19 transmission. Further studies accounting for heterogenous travel interventions are warranted.

0eee9760aee0ca2fdf8d1d215c3689d5f8d84df5,"Background With the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, Hubei Province to other areas of the country, medical staff in Fever Clinics faced the challenge of identifying suspected cases among febrile patients with acute respiratory infections. We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing.","The first cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown origin emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in early December, 2019 1,2 . A novel coronavirus had been isolated from these patients, and subsequently named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on January 12, 2020 3 , and later as SARS-CoV-2. The initially confirmed cases were localized in Wuhan and mostly associated with Huanan Seafood Wholesale market in the city 2 , but soon the disease spread rapidly to other areas of the country. On January 19, 2020, two cases in Beijing and one case in Guangdong Province were reported 4 , and subsequently more cases were reported elsewhere 5-8 .
Since the outbreak in Wuhan, as a quick response, Fever Clinics were requested to reinforce case finding of pneumonia of unknown etiologies. Fever Clinics, mostly affiliated to the Division of Infectious Diseases in general hospitals, had been established after SARS outbreak in 2003, and since then served as the first line to monitor and manage acute febrile respiratory infections, mostly seasonal influenza in recent years. For 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), this time, patients with body temperatures≥37.2 o C were asked to firstly visit Fever Clinics, where a triage strategy was implemented 9 , and probable or possible cases were identified by experts or expert panels, and samples were sent for quick viral detection. On Jan. 21, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was identified in our Fever Clinic, and up to Feb. 15, 21 cases were diagnosed, with 19 cases confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV results, among 88 patients with pneumonia sent for viral detection. As far as we know, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting Fever Clinics has not been reported, and there is lack of data comparing the clinical features between COVID-19 and pneumonia of other etiologies.
Therefore, we collected and reviewed the medical records of patients who visited the Fever Clinic in our hospital. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in pneumonias during this period and to find the unique features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias caused by other agents. We believe that the results of our study will add to the knowledge of COVID-19 for practice in Fever Clinics facing newly emerging respiratory infections.
We conducted a retrospective, single-centered study and recruited patients visiting the Fever Clinic at Peking University Third Hospital from January 21 to February 15, 2020. Based on epidemiological history, clinical and radiological manifestations, cases with possible or probably COVID-19 were sent for panel discussion and then for 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. Pediatric patients were not included in our study. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Peking University Third Hospital and the data were analyzed anonymously.
The 
From January 21 to February 15, 2020, based on epidemiological evidence, fever and/or respiratory symptoms, chest radiological findings and blood white blood cell (WBC) results, physicians at the Fever Clinic referred 156 cases to panel discussion by multi-discipline experts. After discussion, 110 were considered to be possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV real-time PCR testing, which was positive in 19 cases (confirmed cases). In another 2 patients, though PCR testing was negative, a clinical diagnosis was made according to epidemiological evidence, consistent clinical and CT findings (clinical cases). These 21 cases were grouped as COVID-19 for this analysis. For the remaining cases with negative viral detection, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was excluded based on inconsistent epidemiological, clinical or radiological data. Among these, 22 were excluded from the analysis because of lack of CT scan or no signs of pneumonia on CT scan, and finally 67 patients with pneumonia of other etiologies were included for analysis as the non-COVID-19 group (see patient selection flowchart in Figure 1 ).
In the study period, 2123 patients visited the Fever Clinic because of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, and 342 patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia based on CT scan or in a few cases on Chest X-ray. The prevalence of COVID-19 in all these pneumonia patients was 6.14% (21/342). The prevalence of COVID-19 in cases with CT-confirmed pneumonia sent for 2019-nCoV testing was 23.9% (21/88).
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the 21 patients with COVID-19 were shown in Table 1 . The median age was 42.0 years (25th-75th percentile, 34.5-66.0 years). Men and women were equally affected. Nineteen patients (90.5%) had a clear epidemiological history All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In the two patients with unclear epidemiological link, one was a social worker contacting a high-flow of people and his wife was confirmed to have COVID-19 by positive 2019-nCoV test about one week later. The other one had no epidemiological history on presentation, but another patient, who had had dinner with him, was also diagnosed to have COVID-19 later. An incubation period was elicited from 12 patients (57.1%), ranging from 2 to 10 days with a median of 6.5 days.
Most of the patients were mild-moderate in disease severity (mild-moderate cases, n=18, 85.7%).
Three patients were classified as severe cases with SpO 2 ≤ 93% on presentation, while no very severe cases were identified in our series.
On presentation, most patients (85.7%) had fever with a mean body temperature of 37.8 o C.
Cough (42.9%), expectoration (33.3%), fatigue (57.1%), headache or dizziness (38.1%) were common symptoms. Other symptoms included shortness of breath, myalgia or arthralgia, sore throat, nasal symptoms and diarrhea ( Blood routine showed that decreased lymphocyte count was present in 38.1% of the COVID-19 patients. More than 80% of COVID-19 patients had normal WBC and neutrophil counts. Compared with COVID-19 patients, the total WBC and neutrophil counts were higher in non-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, more non-COVID-19 patients had higher than normal WBC and neutrophil counts. However, lymphocyte counts and the proportions of patients with decreased lymphocytes were not statistically different between the two groups (Table 3 ).
In non-COVID-19 patients, infiltrates on the CT scan mainly involved 1-2 lung lobes, while in COVID-19 patients, lesions involving 4-5 lobes were more common. In COVID-19 patients, lung lesions were mostly peripheral or sub-pleural in distribution, and in severe cases were diffusely distributed (Figure 2 ). In non-COVID-19 patients, 34.3% showed airway-dominant lesions, while diffuse distribution was found in only 4.5%. The patterns of the lesions showed no significant difference between the two groups. However, centrilobular nodules were observed in non-COVID-19 patients but not in COVID-19 patients (Table 4 ).
As of Feb 15, 2020, 57416 cases of confirmed COVID-19 were reported in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in China, among which 49030 were in Hubei Province, while in Beijing municipality, 380 confirmed cases were reported. Since the outbreak in early December, 2019, case finding and reporting of COVID-19 were required for medical staff in Fever Clinics around the country. During this study period, in Beijing, as in other regions of the country, influenza and other respiratory infections were also prevalent; it was a challenge for physicians to identify suspected COVID-19 from patients with fever, particularly from pneumonia of varied etiologies. Our results here provide information on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the busy Fever Clinic of a teaching hospital and differential characteristics from non-COVID-19 pneumonias.
From January 21, 2019, when the first case of COVID-19 was identified, up to Feb.15, 2020, 2123 patients visited our Fever Clinic because of fever and/or respiratory symptoms, and 342 patients were confirmed to have pneumonia by CT scan or in a few cases by Chest X-ray. The prevalence of COVID-19 in all these pneumonia patients was 6.14% (21/342). The prevalence of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We found that epidemiological history was extremely important for identification of suspected cases of COVID-19 and for differential diagnosis. Over 90% of the COVID-19 patients had clearly identified epidemiological evidence, while in non-COVID-19 patients, epidemiological links could only be found in 32.8%. In our series, most cases were imported from the city of Wuhan or Hubei Province, including traveling to or living in Wuhan or other cities in Hubei, and a few had a history of close contact with individuals coming from the above areas. In the later phase of our study, contact with family members with confirmed COVID-19 was an epidemiological feature and five family clusters were found. A report from Chinese CDC showed that the incidence of COVID-19 outside Hubei Province peaked in Jan 24-27 and most cases (68.6%) had ever exposed to Wuhan or Hubei within 14 days 11 . Weight of exposure history related to Wuhan and Hubei in confirmed cases was decreasing after February 11 . Consistent to previous reports, the incubation period of our cases was in a range of 2-10 days, with a median of 6.5 days [12] [13] [14] .
A unique feature of our study was the comparison between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases visiting the same Fever Clinic at a certain period, with the finding that the total WBC count and the neutrophil count were different between the two groups of patients. Increased total WBC and neutrophil counts were more common in patients with other causes of pneumonia. In contrast, although decrease of lymphocytes was also common in our study, the difference between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases was not significant, probably due to the fact that pneumonias enrolled for this analysis were mostly viral(for example, influenza) or atypical, as classical bacterial pneumonia had been excluded by first screening/triage. Additionally, the percentage of our patients with decreased lymphocytes was not as high as that reported in some previous studies 2, 15 , perhaps due to differences in disease severity. Blood lymphopenia was observed in up to 85% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 16 . Compared with mild and moderate cases, severe cases were more likely to have lymphopenia 2,16,17 . A recent paper by Xu and colleagues showed a lymphocyte decrease in 38% of the cases within symptom onset ≤ 10 days 18 , which was consistent with our data. Therefore, we speculate that persisting decrease of lymphocytes may be an indicator of severe disease, rather than a criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
Unlike pneumonia caused by other pathogens, COVID-19 has some unique characteristics on the CT scan. Firstly, multi-lobe involvement was more common in COVID-19 as compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. The lesions, including GGO, mixed GGO and consolidation, or patchy consolidation, were mainly distributed in peripheral and sub-pleural areas in mild to moderate cases, while in severe cases diffuse ground glass lesions were present. In the study by Pan and colleagues, 11.1% and 44.4% of the 63 patients showed four and five lobe involvement, with patchy/punctate GGO and patchy consolidation being the dominant patterns on CT scan 19 .
Other studies also demonstrated similar CT findings 20 . Our study had several limitations. As a single-center, retrospective study of patients mainly from Haidian District in Beijing, the prevalence of COVID-19 in this Fever Clinic was not representative. The sample was small-sized and mostly mild and moderate in severity, which may not reflect the whole picture of the disease. Furthermore, the pathogens causing pneumonia in patients without COVID-19 were not identified, therefore we were unable to evaluate the prevalence of other common viral pneumonias of this season, such as influenza pneumonia and All rights reserved.

During the study period when COVID-19 was epidemic, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting our Fever Clinic was 6.14%. Most of the COVID-19 cases were mild and moderate in severity and more than 90% had identified epidemiological exposure.
Changes of WBC and neutrophil counts showed clinical significance for differential diagnosis of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV or other pathogens. CT findings of COVID-19 were characteristic, including the number of affected lobes, lesion patterns and distribution, which may be helpful for clinicians to identify suspected cases of COVID-19 from pneumonia of other etiologies.

0fa18c47543c3ce69a3c9e4d77958c4d3691b1ed,"Sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also denominated sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is an integral membrane protein with multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.","The sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also defined the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) or also liver bile acid transporter, is an integral transmembrane protein that is encoded by the SLC10A1 (solute carrier family 10, member 1) human gene and shows multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains (1) . This transporter plays a critical role in maintenance of the enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids and hepatocyte function. The protein is constituted by 349 aminoacids with a resulting molecular mass of 56 kDa and works by binding two sodium ions and one (conjugated) bile salt molecule, in this manner determining hepatic influx of bile salts. Other molecules that may be transported by this protein comprise steroid and thyroid hormones, and xenobiotics of different origin (2) . NTCP also represents the receptor for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the interaction between the aminoacid sequences of NTCP and those of HBV surface proteins has been characterized in molecular details. The preS1 sequence of large envelope protein (L) is essential for interaction with a stretch of nine hydrophobic residues (157-KGIVISLVL-165) located in the third transmembrane domain of NTCP. The sequence of the preS1 L protein binding NTCP is constituted by a stretch of predominantly hydrophobic aminoacids (residues 2-48) and, within this stretch, there is a highly conserved motif (9-NPLGF(F/L)P-15) that is essential for binding (3) . It is apparent that knowledge of the mechanics of interaction at this level may be instrumental in developing strategies aimed at preventing preS1/NTCP interaction with consequent internalization. We therefore decided to use computational tools to investigate sequence similarities in other proteins that may interact with the preS1 sequence as well as with other surface proteins of viruses. To this end, we chose a well-characterized multifunctional serum protein that has the ability to work as a transporter, a hormone-and fatty acid binding protein, and an immune stimulating cytokine, the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) macrophage activating factor (MAF). This is a serum alpha-2 glycoprotein constituted by a single polypeptide chain showing a molecular mass of 51-58 kDa. From the structural point of view, it is related to serum albumin and it is also known as Gc (Group-component) globulin. DBP synthesis occurs in the liver and its level in human plasma is around 20-55 mg/100 ml. DBP is a multifunctional protein that, in addition to vitamin D, binds actin, acting as an actin scavenger, and also binds fatty acids. The protein is constituted by 458 aminoacids and shows three domains that share limited sequence similarity with each other as well as with similar sequences of human albumin. The first domain contains the vitamin D-binding site that is located in a shallow cleft that allows interaction with the plasma membrane. DBP is present on the surface of several cell types that comprise yolk sac endodermal cells and T lymphocytes. In B lymphocytes, DBP is responsible for the linkage of surface immunoglobulins, thus contributing to the balance of the immune response (4). The de-glycosylated form of DBP is a powerful macrophage activating factor -hence the designation DBP-MAF -and shows a number of biological effects (5) . We demonstrated that, in addition to its presence in human serum, DBP-MAF is formed during fermentation of milk and colostrum (6) as well as during fermentation of hemp seed proteins (7). Here, we demonstrate that DBP-MAF shares significant similarities with hydrophobic sequences of NTCP that interact with the preS1 sequence of L protein. We also show that DBP-MAF, but not NTCP, shares similarities between the hydrophobic sequence of the fatty acid binding site and the domain IV of the same L protein. Finally, we show the .

Study of in vitro interaction between DBP-MAF or the product of microbial fermentation of milk and colostrum mentioned above, here abbreviated in PMF (Product of Microbial Fermentation), and NAGAB_HUMAN was was performed by R.E.D. Laboratories (Zellik, Belgium) where NAGAB_HUMAN and DBP-MAF had been purified. NAGAB_HUMAN is an enzyme that cleaves terminal alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine residues from glycolipids, glycopeptides and glycoproteins; it binds to the alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine moiety that is attached to threonine in the sequence TPTELAK close to the carboxyl terminus of DBP-MAF. Therefore, binding of NAGAB_HUMAN is a direct method to evaluate DBP-MAF activity in serum or other matrices. For these experiments, microtiter plates coated with a specific antibody directed against NAGAB_HUMAN were used. Samples were incubated with standardized dilutions of NAGAB_HUMAN coming from a pool of 300 human sera from healthy subjects who did not show any sign of chronic inflammation or any disease. After 1 h incubation and exhaustive washing, complexes formed by NAGAB_HUMAN and purified DBP-MAF, used as positive control, or NAGAB_HUMAN and PMF, were revealed with horse radish peroxidase conjugate to rabbit antibody. The serum pool was mixed either with 200 ng of purified DBP-MAF, or with the fermented product in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with the goal of studying the kinetics of interaction between NAGAB_HUMAN and DBP-MAF or NAGAB_HUMAN and the PMF. The compounds were incubated at 25C for 4, 24, 48, 72 and 120 h. Values for NAGAB_HUMAN binding activity in the absence of DBP-MAF or the PMF, with only PBS in the reaction mixture, were taken as 1.00. The experiment was repeated twice and the results reported in this study are the means of the two experiments.

The degree of similarity in the aminoacid sequences is apparent in several regions of the proteins. Fig. 2, panel A, shows the infectivity determinant of HBV. The preS1 sequence in L protein (residues 2-48) is the sequence that specifically interacts with NTCP. Within this sequence, a highly conserved motif (9-NPLGF(F/L)P-15) is crucial for binding (11) . Fig. 2, panel B , shows the preS1 binding sequence of NTCP aligned with the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF. It is worth noticing that the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP, that is the stretch that binds preS1, shows four amino acids that are identical to those of the aligned sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. Fig. 2 , panel C, shows that DBP-MAF presents a sequence that is very similar to that of domain IV of the L NH2-EC1  TM1   TM1  TM2   TM3  TM4   TM5   TM6  TM6   TM7   TM7   IC1   IC2   IC3   COOH-IC4   EC2   EC3   EC3 EC4 .

Both sequences are rich in hydrophobic residues; the sequence of DBP-MAF is located in a shallow cleft of the proteins that facilitates its binding to fatty acids that are sandwiched between the protein and the plasma membrane as we proposed in 2013 (12) . The sequence of domain IV of the L protein of HBV is a transmembrane domain that participates in infectivity (11) . Fig. 2, panel D, shows the peculiar concentration of negatively charged residues in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence of NTCP that binds preS1. In DBP-MAF, there are two contiguous negatively charged amino acids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED) for a total of five negatively charged residues, whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in the binding and electrostatic neutralization of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. In particular, it may be involved in binding the sequences TNGTKR, HKNNKS, RSYLTPGDSSSG, and QTNSPRRA that are characterized by a high surface concentration of positive charges interspersed with hydrophobic residues (10, 13) . It is worth noticing that neutralization of positively charged residues may represent a strategy that exploits electrostatic interactions between charges on the surface of molecules. Such as strategy may not be limited to proteins; negatively charged glycosaminoglycans such as lowmolecular-weight chrondroitin sulfate (14) might also serve the scope of binding and neutralizing those sequences.

This latter protein has enzymatic activity and directly interacts with DBP-MAF, more precisely, it binds to alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine that is attached to threonine in the sequence TPTELAK close to the carboxyl terminus of DBP-MAF (see the sequence within the red square in Fig. 3) . We chose to study this protein because of its role in DBP-MAF function and we found that there is a high degree of similarity with the other two proteins, DBP-MAF and NTCP, with particular reference to stretches of hydrophobic aminoacids. Based on these evidence, we asked an independent laboratory to perform in vitro experiments to assess the binding of DBP-MAF to NAGAB_HUMAN using, as ligands, purified DBP-MAF and PMF (6, 8) . Fig. 4 , shows that purified DBP-MAF, used as positive control, bound NAGAB_HUMAN only after 4 h incubation, reached a peak at 48 h, and returned below baseline values at 120 h. PMF, diluted 1:10 with PBS, had an initial value (at time 0) higher than that observed with PBS alone and higher than that observed with purified DBP-MAF; we interpret this result as indication that PMF has a much higher NAGAB_HUMAN-binding activity in comparison with purified DBP-MAF. At every time point, the PMF showed significantly higher activity in comparison with purified DBP-MAF. At 120 h, the activity of PMF was still well above the value obtained with the negative control, PBS, whereas DBP-MAF did not show any residual activity (not shown). Other experiments performed with 1:100 dilution showed a similar trend and the activity of PMF was always higher than that of purified DBP-MAF even at the highest dilution. These results led us .

We attribute this higher activity to the presence of vitamin D 3 and fatty acids that are natural constituents of milk and colostrum. The presence of these hydrophobic moieties may favor interaction between DBP-MAF and NAGAB_HUMAN stabilizing the complex formed by the two proteins. The sequence similarities shown in Fig. 3 seem to support this hypothesis that is further corroborated by the recent observation that DBP-MAF conjugated with vitamin D 3 is much more efficient than DBP-MAF alone as an immune stimulating factor (15) . Hydrophobic interactions between the sequences of DBP-MAF and preS1 and domain IV of L protein may also help interpreting the biological effects reported in Fig. 4 (insert) . In this case, we can hypothesize two binding sites located at the two extremities of L protein. These interactions would be stabilized, as in the case of DBP-MAF/NAGAB_HUMAN complexes, by vitamin D 3 and fatty acids. This hypothesis is corroborated by the observation that viral proteins are able to bind directly vitamin D 3 (16) , and fatty acids show anti-viral properties that are due to prevention of entry of the viral genome into the host cell (17) as we propose being the case for the interaction between DBP-MAF/vitamin D 3 /fatty acids and preS1 and L protein hydrophobic sequences.

The process of fermentation of hemp seed protein extract was performed using the following materials a proprietary probiotic formula containing Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and proprietary cultured kefir grains whose peculiar microflora was recently described (8) . The fermented hemp seed protein extract caused inhibition of HCT116 cell proliferation that was statistically significant (p < 0.05). We attribute this effect to formation of bioactive peptides from edestin. Edestin is an hexameric globular protein that bears striking functional resemblance to DBP-MAF. We postulate that proteases secreted by the microbes of the probiotic formulation, together with the increase of acidity that is characteristic of fermentation, led to formation of peptides functionally very similar to DBP-MAF and, in",Significance of hydrophobic and charged sequence similarities in sodium-bile acid cotransporter and vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor,biorxiv,10.1101/2020.03.03.975524,,,biorxiv,2020-03-05,"Zunaid, I.

Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for complex diagnostic infrastructure.

The diagnostics industry has responded rapidly, with Emergency Use Authorization granted for PCR-based tests from the US CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html), Seegene in Korea and BGI in China (https://www.bgi.com/global/company/news/bgi-develops-realtime-dna-based-kit-for-detecting-the-2019-novel-coronavirus/) among many other providers releasing reagents, primers and probes, and other materials to support this urgent public health need. The current diagnostic standard combines clinical symptoms and molecular method, and as many of the symptoms resembles those of common cold and influenza, an accurate molecular result is critical for final diagnosis. These molecular methods include metagenomics sequencing mNGS (1) and RT-qPCR(2), both are excellent and sensitive techniques, but approaches not without limitations. mNGS is restricted by throughput, turnover time, formidable high cost and requirement for high technical expertise. As with most molecular diagnostics, RT-qPCR is the most widely used method, but it requires expensive laboratory instruments and is difficult to utilize outside of well-equipped facilities. In combination to the different patient samples containing variable number of virus, a high proportion of patients were diagnosed as false negatives (3, 4) .
Here we describe a molecular diagnostic approach for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and simple visual detection of amplification for potential use in rapid, field applications. LAMP was developed as a rapid and reliable method to amplify from a small amount target sequence at a single reaction temperature, obviating the need for sophisticated thermal cycling equipment (5) . Since the initial description of LAMP, a number of advancements in detection technology have helped establish LAMP as a standard method for simple isothermal diagnostics. These detection methods have allowed detection by visual examination without instrumentation using dyes that utilize inherent by-products of the extensive DNA synthesis, such as malachite green (6), calcein (7) and hydroxynaphthol .

We recently developed a method for visual detection of LAMP amplification (9) using pH-sensitive dyes to exploit the change of pH that resulting from proton accumulation due to dNTP incorporation. This method has been used in a large scale field survey of Wolbachia-containing mosquitos (10), Grapevine red blotch virus without DNA extraction (11) , testing urine samples for Zika virus (12) and even amplification detection on the International Space Station (13) . The breadth of application highlights the applicability of visual detection methods to provide an advantage in simplicity and portability for enabling new, rapid diagnostics.
This study describes testing and validation of 5 sets LAMP primers targeting two fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 genome using short (~300bp) RNA fragments made with in vitro transcription and RNA samples from patients. We also demonstrate compatibility with simple approaches to RNA purification to simplify the detection procedure and avoid complex RNA extraction, and with clinical swab samples taken from COVID-19 patients. Our aim is to share this information in order to help develop a reliable and easy method to detect this viral RNA outside of sophisticated diagnostic laboratories and expand the toolbox of molecular tests used to combat and surveil this growing public health threat.
We designed 5 sets of LAMP primers targeting two fragments (Table 1) of SARS-CoV-2 sequence (GenBank accession number MN908947) using the online software Primer Explorer V5 (available for free use at: https://primerexplorer.jp/e/). DNA fragments containing these two regions were synthesized as gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies) and T7 RNA polymerase promoters were added by PCR (NEB M0493, numbers indicate NEB catalog ID unless otherwise noted) using primer pairs where one primer containing the promoter sequence. RNAs were then synthesized by in vitro transcription (E2050) using these PCR products as templates and purified using RNA clean up columns (T2040). The resulting RNAs as well as the gBlocks were serially diluted in 10-fold increments using 0.1x TE buffer containing 0.01% Tween 20. RT-.

If the samples were not for use immediately, they were stored at 4 °C.
Total viral RNA was extracted from the deactivated samples using automated extraction instrument, Purifier TM Modesty (Genfine Biotech, Beijing-China, LTD), according to the .

We designed 5 full LAMP primers sets targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with amplicon regions designed to the 5′ region of the ORF1a gene and Gene N. Each set was tested with synthetic DNA substrates and RNA transcribed from that DNA substrate before consideration for use clinically. To evaluate detection sensitivity, synthetic RNAs were serially diluted from ~120 million copies down to ~120 copies (per 25 μ L reaction) at 10fold intervals in LAMP reactions. All five primer sets showed similar detection sensitivity and could consistently detect as low as a few hundred copies, with sporadic detection of 120 copies (or 4.8 copies/μL; Fig. 1 ). The results from colorimetric detection were 100% in agreement with the real time detection. To estimate the relative efficiency using RNA or DNA templates, we compared synthetic RNA with similarly diluted gBlock dsDNA on real-time LAMP signal (Fig. 2) . For the 2 primer sets we compared, one showed slightly slower amplification and detection with RNA template while the other appeared slightly faster, confirming the RNA is efficiently converted to cDNA by the reverse transcriptase (WarmStart RTx) and subsequently amplified via LAMP by the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (Bst 2.0 WarmStart).

This will of course enable maximum efficiency and sensitivity but requires skill and instrumentation in addition to adding extra time to the diagnostic workflow. We investigated whether it is possible to perform detection using crude cell lysate in order to avoid this RNA purification step. The results indicated that ~480 copies were detected with all four primer sets, a similar sensitivity as the detection sensitivity with synthetic RNA alone (Fig. 3A) with no interference by the lysate to either the amplification efficiency or visual color change. We also tested whether we could recover the synthetic RNA spiked into biological sample with a mock experiment during purification of total RNA. We spiked various amount of synthetic RNA into whole human blood and purified the total blood RNA. We were able to recover and detect the spiked RNA (Fig. 3B) , indicating the total RNA has no interference during the purification or the detection process. While the column-based approach is less compatible with the simple, field detection enabled by colorimetric LAMP, this is a typical laboratory workflow and can be used with simple isothermal amplification in a similar fashion to more expensive and involved qPCR detection workflows.
With this preliminary evaluation of potential LAMP primer sets, the best performing sets (ORF1a-A, GeneN-A) were shared and synthesized in Wuhan for testing with actual COVID-19 samples. RNA was extracted from swabs using the standard laboratory protocol (see Materials and Methods) and RNA tested in colorimetric RT-LAMP alongside a commercial RT-qPCR assay. In addition to controls, a total of 7 patient RNA samples were tested, 6 of which were determined to be positive by RT-qPCR using ORF1a primers (C q 25-36.5, Table 2 ) and 4 positive with Gene N primers. One sample was negative by both RT-qPCR primer sets. When these samples were tested in the colorimetric LAMP assay, all 6 RT-qPCR positive samples showed visible color change indicating positive amplification, while the single RT-qPCR negative samples maintained pink color and was judged negative (Figure 4 ). Thus the colorimetric LAMP assay showed 100% agreement with the RT-qPCR results across a range of C q values. Although a small number of samples were tested here, the colorimetric LAMP assay enables reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection without sophisticated instrumentation, matching the RT-qPCR performance in field and point-of-care settings.

Not only purified RNA can be used as the sample input, but also direct tissue or cell lysate may be used without an RNA purification step. This combination of a quick sample preparation method with an easy detection process may allow the development of portable, field detection in addition to a rapid screening for point-of-need testing applications. This virus represents an emerging significant public health concern and expanding the scope of diagnostic utility to applications outside of traditional laboratories will enable greater prevention and surveillance approaches. The efforts made here will serve as a model for inevitable future outbreaks where the use of next generation portable diagnostics will dramatically expand the reach of our testing capabilities for better healthcare outcomes.

0fd300aefb704c20f32152b97b6194015f1c74e7,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originating from Wuhan, China in early December, has infected more than 70,000 people in China and other countries and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, a city located in central China, in early December, is fast spreading to more than 30 countries (Benvenuto et al., 2020; She et al., 2020) . In less than 3 months, the disease has infected more than 70,000 people globally, and has caused more than 2,000 deaths. On January 30 th , 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. Upon composing this manuscript, the coronavirus is concurrently spreading and claiming more than 100 lives per day. This outbreak induces an urgency to determine the characteristics of COVID-19 transmission and implement optimal strategies to control the epidemic.
Coronavirus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus found in a variety of mammals, including bats, civets, camel, and pangolins (Ge et al., 2013; Kandeil et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2007; Rockx et al., 2011) . Two strains of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, have been reported to cause severe respiratory syndromes, resulting in deadly epidemics in 2002 and 2012, respectively (Fung and Liu, 2019; Luk et al., 2019) . This current coronavirus, denoted as SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans. (Benvenuto et al., 2020) .
To effectively fight and end the COVID-19 epidemic, the transmission of the disease and zoonotic source of origin must be accurately identified, leading to the discovery of an optimal strategy to control this outbreak. By studying the cases and clinical features from early reports, this paper illustrates rigorous epidemiological models and the associated statistical methods to estimate the transmission rates in different stages and scenarios and predict the outcomes for different control strategies.
The numbers of cases from January 21 st to February 20 th , 2020 were obtained from the daily reports by National Health Commission (NHC) of China. As NHC did not release case reports until January 21 st , the case numbers prior to January 21 st were obtained from two recent clinical reports (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . The number of patients diagnosed out of Wuhan was obtained from the report by which summarized 1,099 cases confirmed by January 29 th , 2020. The case numbers for the Diamond Princess Cruise were obtained from the daily reports by Yokohama Port Quarantine Center.
A susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine model was used for transmission analysis and prediction of epidemiological spread,

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 where S, E, I, Q and N were the number of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), quarantined (Q) and total population. The population in Wuhan (N) is 11,081,000. Assuming that a patient was quarantined immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed, Q was equal to the confirmed number of cases. β is the daily transmission rate, defined as the expected number of infections caused by one infectious person per day. Once a susceptible (S) person becomes infected, the status is changed to exposed for an incubation period, 1/α. Theoretically, the patient is not infectious during the incubation period. After incubation, the patient experiences disease onset and becomes infectious (I). The time interval between disease onset to quarantine (Q) is the infectious time, 1/γ.
Because the SEIQ model cannot be solved explicitly, β was estimated using the Monte carlo method, which simulated the two independent Poisson processes: daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time. To estimate β, there are two scenarios to consider. Firstly, the number of cases may only be available at the beginning and end of the study period. The examples used were the Diamond Princess Cruise and Wuhan prior to January 20 th when the diagnosis kit was not sufficiently available. In this scenario, β was estimated by Monte carlo approximation of the number of cases at the end of the targeted time period. Secondly, the number of Q is made available each day for the examples and the number of confirmed cases in China after January 20 th . In this scenario, γ was first determined from clinical reports for the targeted time period, and then β was estimated by minimizing the mean squared errors from 1,000 Monte carlo samples that approximated the Q curve.

To evaluate different control strategies, Monte carlo samples were generated given β, γ, initial E, and initial I. The simulation was based on two independent Poisson processes: daily exposed cases and the individual incubation time. The daily means and 95% confidence intervals for Q were obtained over 1,000 Monte carlo runs.
Epidemiological analysis was performed on data collected from the Mainland of China between January 1 st and January 20 th , 2020. During this period, the suspected zoonotic source, the Huanan Seafood Market, was closed and travel restrictions were not yet enforced by the government. Based on the reported clinical analysis for the 425 cases prior to January 23 rd , the average inoculation time interval was found to be 5.2 days and the average time interval from disease onset to a clinical visit was 5.8 days . In this study, the total number of cases, 8247, including both confirmed and suspected patients, on January 26, 2020 were used as the number of onsets (I+E) for January 20 th , 2020. In the same way, the total number of cases reported between January 1 st and January 7 th , which totaled 136, was used as I0 in the SEIQ model. Because the SEIQ model cannot be solved explicitly, Monte carlo simulation was exploited to determine the daily transmission rate β0=0.44 with 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43 to 0.47 ( Figure 1A ). Given the mean time interval between onset and hospital quarantine of 12.5 days, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 5.5 (95% CI 5.3 to 5.8).

Most of infected cases in December 2019 were linked to the Huanan Seafood Market, which retails seafood and wild animals. It is believed that an enclosed and crowded environment is favorable for coronavirus transmission, however the epidemiological data is lacking. To test the hypothesis, the recent Diamond Princess cruise epidemic was used as a comparable case study. A clear disease outbreak was reported on this cruise. A passenger, who visited China on January 10 th , was on board from January 20 th and January 25 th before being confirmed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. All people on board have been quarantined at sea since February 5 th and 621 out of 3711 people were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. As some of the patients were known to be infected after the quarantine, possibly due to central air conditioning and family infection, only the confirmed cases (n=135) by February 10 th (five days incubation plus one day diagnosis) were used for a conservative estimation of transmission. Using a SEIQ model while Q=0, the daily transmission rate, β, was found to be 1.04 (95% CI 0.69-1.87) ( Figure 1B ), which is twice as much as the transmission rate in open cities. Using the infection period of 12.5 days, the effective reproductive number on the cruise, Rc, was 13.0 (95% CI 8.63-23.375).
The link between many of the December cases and the Huanan Seafood Market indicates that the Huanan Seafood Market is one of the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2, if not only.
After the forced shutdown of the Huanan Seafood Market on January 1 st , the effectiveness of the zoonotic infection and a potential secondary source of SARS-CoV-2 that continued to infect the Wuhan people remained in question.

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 To characterize the zoonotic infection of COVID-19, a SEIQ model was constructed to analyze for the epidemic from the Hunan Seafood Market in December 2019. The first SARS-CoV-2 onset was found on December 1 st 2019 (Huang et al., 2020) , and by the 1 st of January, 41 patients were confirmed and quarantined. Using the 5.8-day interval between disease onset and clinical visit, 136 cases diagnosed in the first 6 days of January were included, bringing the total number of infections to 177. Given β0=0.44, the development of the epidemic was simulated by initializing with a range of numbers (from 1 to 5) of infections on December 1 st using the SEIQ model. It showed that at most one infected patient can be allowed in the model, which induced a mean of 174 infections (95% CI 161-187) by January 1 st . Instead of one, if two unrelated people were infected by December 1 st , the 95% CI would be (291, 318) on January 1 st , significantly larger than the expected 177 cases. Thus, the transmission would be so minimal that it would not substantially contribute to the final number of infections, even if there existed a second zoonotic source. In the same sense, the results did not support a continuous zoonotic source within the Huanan Seafood Market, which would have resulted in a higher overall number of infections in the later trajectory.
As an RNA virus, coronavirus conveys a high mutation rate (Benvenuto et al., 2020) , raising concerns whether the transmission would change between generations. The significantly higher mortality rate observed in Wuhan suggested that the transmission may attenuate over generations. To test this hypothesis, the patients infected in December 2019 were considered as the first generation because most of the cases had links to the Huanan Market, while the patients infected in January 2020 were considered the second-or-later generation. Given the data from December (assuming there is only one case at the beginning of December), β was estimated to be .

Furthermore, the transmission rates between Wuhan and other cities were also compared. Based on Guan et al's analysis of 1,099 patients confirmed by January 29 th , 616 were identified outside of Wuhan. Out of the 616 patients193 had recently visited Wuhan. Using a mean infectious period of 5 days, β was calculated to 0.438 (β=(616-193)/193/5=0.438), which was within the 95% confidence interval of the previous estimation of β0 in Wuhan, 0.44 (95% CI 0.43-0.47). Therefore, no evidence of attenuation of transmission was found.
Unprecedented measures were taken in Wuhan to stop the spread of COVID-19. Immediately after the official announcement of the novel coronavirus, home isolations and personal protection equipment such as face masks and gloves were enforced. Public transportation was limited and, eventually, all canceled. On January 23 rd , the government suspended all plane, train and bus travel in and out of Wuhan. On February 2 nd , a comprehensive quarantine strategy was taken by the Chinese government. All home-isolated patients were mandated to be hospitalized in the newly built square cabin hospitals, and all people who had suspected symptoms or had close contacts were demanded for mandatory isolation in the quarantine stations. The effects of these steps may not be clear until the end of the epidemic. Nevertheless, an intermediate analysis is needed for evaluating various control strategies.
Considering the one-day delay in the quarantine of the patients in the square cabin hospitals, the SEIQ model was used to fit the data into two phases, from January 23 rd to February 2 nd , and from February 3 rd to February 20 th . In the first phase, γ was chosen to be 1/6 based on the analysis by .

Using least squared errors for an exhaustive search of β, the optimal transmission rate became 0.54, which was greater than the basic transmission rate β0=0.44 ( Figure   2A ). In the second phase, the time interval from disease onset to quarantine was assumed to drop by another 50% due to the implication of the square cabin hospitals. Thus, γ=1/6, the transmission rate β decreased to 0.10, which was an 81.5% reduction from the first phase and a 77.3% reduction from the basic transmission rate. In conclusion, the aggressive quarantine strategy of building square cabin hospitals has effectively decreased the transmission, whereas the usefulness of the travel ban, home isolation, and personal protection is still unclear.
To further investigate the timing of the comprehensive quarantine, given β=0.10 and γ=1/6, simulated isolations were employed to track the numbers of confirmed cases (Q) at various starting dates, January 1 st , 10 th , 20 th , and 30 th . The initial number of cases was estimated by the SEIQ model.
The predicted Q value was plotted on a logarithm scale up to February 29 th ( Figure 2B) . It was noted that all curves tended to stabilize after the quarantine measures, and the time interval to stabilization increased as the number of initial cases increased. Beginning the quarantine on January 1 st , 136 initial cases were reported. Curve stabilization was achieved after about 10 days, with 235 cases reported at the end of this period. January 10 th started with approximately 1,250 cases and ended with 1,834 cases and January 20 th started with about 8,250 and ended with about 12,000. The January 30 th quarantine took almost 20 days to reach stabilization, and the final number of cases, 62,635, was nearly double the initial number of cases, 38,397. It was noted that the prediction was rather accurate as illustrated by the small 95% CI (gray area), and the CI decreased to negligible as the initial number of cases increased.

The basic reproductive number, R0, for SARS was determined to be 3 with 95% CI being 2 to 4 (Dye and Gay, 2003) . However, contrary to public knowledge, the earlier reports from the COVID-19 outbreak provided a R0 number less than or equal to that for SARS Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . This may have resulted from an inaccurate number of clinical cases due to delayed clinical visits, overloading of clinical resources, and a low sensitivity of the COVID-19 diagnosis kit. With more clinical reports published, the case numbers were adjusted based on the information presented, which gave a more accurate transmission estimation. The basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was then found to be 5.6, which is substantially higher than that for SARS.
In an enclosed and crowded environment, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was thought to significantly increase. The Diamond Princess Cruise provided an excellent case study as the development of COVID-19 on the cruise line has a clear infectious source, exposure time, quarantine time, and total number of infections. The transport of the virus through the central air conditioning system and the ineffective quarantine of the ship's crew, however, raised some concerns. Nevertheless, a conservative estimation of transmission using only 50% of the confirmed cases has proven the high transmission rate in an enclosed crowded ship. This suggested that the initial offense within the Huanan Seafood Market could be at a high level.
The likely zoonotic origin also raised questions about additional sources other than the Huanan Seafood Market. This argument was partially supported by several early cases with no .

known links to the Huanan Seafood Market. Rigorous statistical models were used to test the hypothesis of a second zoonotic source, and the development of case numbers did not support this hypothesis. Though our model cannot completely exclude the possibility of additional zoonotic sources, it suggested a minimal effect by such sources. Furthermore, the model did not support the constant zoonotic infection within Huanan Seafood Market throughout December. If the zoonotic transgression was sustained, a larger number of infected cases would have been observed. Based on the data from the Diamond Process Cruise, the transmission rate was higher in an enclosed and crowded place, like the Huanan Seafood Market. However, similar transmission rate was observed in December as in January. This is likely due to the market's daytime only operating hours, reducing the contact time. This result further suggested similar transmission rate between generations, which was confirmed by comparing the transmission in Wuhan and other cities. High mutation rates have been observed in the genome sequences collected from more than 100 human specimens. However, the effect that these mutations have on transmission may not be observed in such a short time period.
The Chinese government took unprecedented measures to fight the new epidemic and those measures raised global controversy for their necessity and effectiveness. The restrictive travel ban and home isolation enforced in Wuhan was expected to largely decrease the transmission and prevent further spread of the disease within weeks. Nevertheless, the coronavirus infection was continuously increasing exponentially in late January and early February in Wuhan. In this model, an increase in the transmission rate (from 0.44 to 0.54) was observed during this time period. It suggested that the travel ban and home isolation cannot effectively prevent the disease spread. This was likely due to the probable cross-contamination in the long waiting lines at the .

The limited medical resources only allowed patients with severe symptoms to be hospitalized. A low sensitivity of diagnosis further increased the waiting time for a confirmed case. Insufficient hospital beds resulted in a large number of home isolated patients, often leading to family infection. Observing the tremendous epidemic, the Chinese government built square cabin hospitals with more than twenty thousand beds and quickly moved all patients into these hospitals. All people with suspected symptoms or with close patient contacts were isolated in the government-managed quarantine stations. This comprehensive quarantine method has successfully reduced the transmission rate by 81.5%, and also greatly shortened the infectious time interval. The analysis in this study showed that the epidemic can be controlled within a few weeks if the comprehensive quarantine was conducted on January 20 th or earlier. Concurrently with the development of this manuscript, it was reported that South Korea had more than 1,000 home isolations in the city of Daegu for a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is highly recommended that other countries immediately quarantine all suspected patients.
This model was developed using the cases up to February 20 th . As the case numbers increase, the transmission features may change and some of the assumptions, such as the infectious period, may vary. The cases reported in Wuhan were known to be less than the actual number in January due to overloading of clinical resources and the low sensitivity of diagnosis.
This study attempted to overcome these limitations by using the clinical information verified by several reports and relying only on the beginning and ending cases. Therefore, this model tended to reflect the real trend of this critical epidemic and it provides more convincing evidence to guide the control of this disease by the government.

0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number R 0 -the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of R 0 vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of R 0 across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation intervalḠ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. We then apply our framework to early estimates of R 0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early R 0 estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of R 0 , including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate R 0 at the outset of an epidemic.","Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading in China and other parts of the world (World Health Organization, 2020d). Although the virus is believed to have originated from animal reservoirs (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020), the ability of SARS-CoV-2 ability to directly transmit between humans has posed a greater threat for its spread World Health Organization, 2020c) . As of February 27, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 82,294 cases of the coronavirus disease , including 3,664 confirmed cases in 46 different countries, outside China (World Health Organization, 2020a).
As the disease continues to spread, many researchers have already published their analyses of the outbreak as pre-prints (e.g., Bedford et al. (2020) ; ; Liu et al. (2020) ; Majumder and Mandl (2020) ; Read et al. (2020a) ; ) and in peer-reviewed journals (e.g., ; Riou and Althaus (2020b) ; Wu et al. (2020) ; ), focusing in particular on estimates of the basic reproductive number R 0 (i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case in a fully susceptible population (Anderson and May, 1991; Diekmann et al., 1990) ). Estimates of the basic reproductive number are of interest during an outbreak because they provide information about the level of intervention required to interrupt transmission (Anderson and May, 1991) , and about the potential final size of the outbreak (Anderson and May, 1991; Ma and Earn, 2006) . We commend these researchers for their timely contribution and those who made the data publicly available. However, it can be difficult to compare a disparate set of estimates of R 0 from different research groups (as well as the associated degrees of uncertainty) when the estimation methods and their underlying assumptions vary widely.
Here, we show that a wide range of approaches to estimating R 0 can be understood and compared in terms of estimates of three quantities: the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation intervalḠ, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. The generation interval, defined as the interval between the time when an individual becomes infected and the time when that individual infects another individual (Svensson, 2007) , plays a key role in shaping the relationship between r and R 0 (Wearing et al., 2005; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007; Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Park et al., 2019) ; therefore, estimates of R 0 from different models directly depend on their implicit assumptions about the generation-interval distribution and the exponential growth rate. Early in an epidemic, information is scarce and there is inevitably a great deal of uncertainty surrounding both case reports (affecting the estimates of the exponential growth rate) and contact tracing (affecting the estimates of the generation-interval distribution). We suggest that disease modelers should make sure their assumptions about these three quantities are clear and reasonable, and that estimates of uncertainty in R 0 should propagate error from all three sources (Elderd et al., 2006) .
We compare seven disparate models published online between January 23-26, 2020 that estimated R 0 for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (Bedford et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Majumder and Mandl, 2020; Read et al., 2020a; Riou and Althaus, 2020a; . We use a Bayesian multilevel model to construct pooled estimates for the three key quantities: r,Ḡ, and κ; the pooled estimates reflect the uncertainties present in modeling approaches and their underlying assumptions. We use these pooled estimates to illustrate the importance of propagating different sources of error, particularly uncertainty in both the growth rate and the generation interval. We also use our framework to tease apart which assumptions of these different models led to their different estimates and confidence intervals. Despite the availability of more recent and/or updated estimates of R 0 , we restrict ourselves to the estimates above in order to focus on the resolution of uncertainty in the earliest stages of an epidemic.
We gathered information on estimates of R 0 and their assumptions about the underlying generation-interval distributions from 7 articles that were published online between January 23-26, 2020 (Table 1) . Five studies (Liu et al., 2020; Majumder and Mandl, 2020; Read et al., 2020a; Riou and Althaus, 2020a; were uploaded to pre-print servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN); one report was posted on the web site of Imperial College London ; and one report was posted on nextstrain.org (Bedford et al., 2020) . Their modeling approaches vary widely: a branching process model (Bedford et al., 2020; Riou and Althaus, 2020a) , a deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model (Read et al., 2020a) , an exponential growth model , a Poisson offspring distribution model (Liu et al., 2020) , and the Incidence 3 .

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint Table 1 : Reported estimates of the basic reproductive number and the assumptions about the generation-interval distributions. Estimates of R 0 and their assumptions about the shape of the generation interval distributions were collected from 7 studies. * We treat these intervals as a 95% confidence interval in our analysis. † We assume κ = 0.5 in our analysis. ‡ The authors presented R 0 estimates under different assumptions regarding the reporting rate; we use their baseline scenario in our analysis to remain consistent with other studies, which do not account for changes in the reporting rate.
Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model (Majumder and Mandl, 2020) . Four studies estimated R 0 by directly fitting their models to incidence data (Read et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2020; Majumder and Mandl, 2020) . The remaining three studies estimated R 0 by comparing the predicted number of cases from their models with the estimated number of total cases by January 18 (between 1,000 and 9,7000 ) Some of these studies have now been published in peer-reviewed journals (Riou and Althaus, 2020b; or have been updated with better uncertainty quantification (Read et al., 2020b) .
Early in an outbreak, R 0 is difficult to estimate directly; instead, R 0 is often inferred from the exponential growth rate r, which can be estimated reliably from incidence data (Ma et al., 2014) . Given an estimate of the exponential growth rate r and an intrinsic generationinterval distribution g(τ ) (Champredon and Dushoff, 2015) , the basic reproductive number can be estimated via the Euler-Lotka equation (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007) :
In other words, estimates of R 0 must depend on the assumptions about the exponential growth rate r and the shape of the generation-interval distribution g(τ ).
Here, we use the gamma approximation framework (Park et al., 2019) to (i) characterize the amount of uncertainty present in the exponential growth rates and the shape of the generation-interval distribution and (ii) assess the degree to which these uncertainties affect the estimate of R 0 . Assuming that generation intervals follow a gamma distribution with the meanḠ and the squared coefficient of variation κ, we have

This equation demonstrates that a generation-interval distribution that has a larger mean (higherḠ) or is less variable (lower κ) will give a higher estimate of R 0 for the same value of r (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007).
As most studies do not report their estimates of the exponential growth rate, we first recalculate the exponential growth rate that correspond to their model assumptions. We do so by modeling reported distributions of the reproductive number R 0 , the mean generation intervalḠ, and the generation-interval dispersion parameter κ with appropriate probability distributions; we used gamma distributions to model values reported with confidence intervals and uniform distributions to model values reported with ranges. For example, Study 3 estimated R 0 = 2.92 (95% CI: 2.28-3.67); we model this estimate as a gamma distribution with a mean of 2.92 and a shape parameter of 67, which has a 95% probability of containing a value between 2.28 and 3.67 (see Table 2 for a complete description). For each study i, we construct a family of parameter sets by drawing 100,000 random samples from the probability distributions ( Table 2 ) that represent the estimates of R 0i and the assumed values ofḠ i and κ i and calculate the exponential growth rate r i via the inverse of Eq. 2:
This allows us to approximate the probability distributions of the estimated exponential growth rates by each study; uncertainties in the probability distributions that we calculate for the estimated exponential growth rates will reflect the methods and assumptions that the studies rely on. We construct pooled estimates for each parameter (r,Ḡ, and κ) using a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, which assumes that the parameters across different studies come from the same gamma distribution. The pooled estimates, which are represented as probability distributions rather than point estimates, allow us to average across different modeling approaches, while accounting for the uncertainties in the assumptions they make:
where µ r , µ G , µ κ represent the pooled estimates, and σ r , σ G , and σ κ represent between-study standard deviations. We account for uncertainties associated with r i ,Ḡ i and κ i (and their correlations), by drawing a random set from the family of parameter sets for each study at each Metropolis-Hastings step. Since the gamma distribution does not allow zeros, we use κ = 0.02 instead for Study 7. We note that this approach does not account for nonindependence between the parameter estimates made by different modelers. As we add more models, the pooled estimates can become sharper even when the models no longer add more information. Thus, the pooled estimator should be interpreted with care.

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint Table 2 : Probability distributions for R 0 ,Ḡ, and κ. We use these probability distributions to obtain a probability distribution for the exponential growth rate r. The gamma distribution is parameterized by its mean and shape α. Constant values are fixed according to Table 1 . * We do not account for this uncertainty during our recalculation of the exponential growth rate r because the reported estimate of R 0 and its uncertainty assumesḠ = 8; the original article reports three R 0 (and 95% CIs) estimates using three different values ofḠ: 7.6 (MERS-like), 8 (average), and 8.4 (SARS-like). We still account for this uncertainty in our pooled estimates (µ G ). † Study 6 uses the IDEA model (Fisman et al., 2013) , through which the authors effectively fit an exponential curve to the cumulative number of confirmed cases without propagating any statistical uncertainty. Instead of modeling R 0 with a probability distribution and recalculating r, we use r = 0.114 days −1 , which explains all uncertainty in the reported R 0 , when combined with the considered range ofḠ.
We use weakly informative priors on hyperparameters:
µ r ∼ Gamma(mean = 1 week −1 , shape = 2) µ G ∼ Gamma(mean = 1 week, shape = 2) µ κ ∼ Gamma(mean = 0.5, shape = 2) (σ r , σ G , σ κ ) ∼ half-normal(0, 10).
We followed recommendations outlined in Gelman et al. (2006) , parameterizing the top-level gamma distributions in terms of their means and standard deviations and imposing weakly informative prior distributions on between-study standard deviations, i.e., half-normal(0, 10). We had initially used gamma priors with small shape parameters (< 1) on between-study shape parameters (= µ 2 /σ 2 ) but found this put too much prior probability on large betweenstudy variances. This phenomenon is a known problem (Gelman et al., 2006) . Alternative choices of prior for the between-study shape parameters are also suboptimal: imposing strong priors (e.g. half-t(µ = 0, σ = 1, ν = 4) assumes a priori that between-study variance is large, while weak priors (e.g. half-Cauchy(0,5)) can lead to poor mixing.
We run 4 independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo chains each consisting of 500,000 burnin steps and 500,000 sampling steps. Posterior samples are thinned every 1000 steps. Convergence is assessed by ensuring that the Gelman-Rubin statistic is below 1.01 for all hyperparameters (Gelman et al., 1992) ; trace plots and marginal posterior distribution plots are presented in Appendix. 95% confidence intervals are calculated by taking 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles from the marginal posterior distribution for each parameter.

We find that there is a large uncertainty associated with the underlying parameters; many models rely on stronger assumptions that ignore these uncertainties. Surprisingly, no studies take into account how the variation in generation intervals affects their estimates of R 0 : all studies assumed fixed values for κ, ranging from 0 to 1. Assuming fixed parameter values can lead to overly strong conclusions (Elderd et al., 2006 ). Fig. 2 shows how propagating uncertainty in different combinations would affect estimates and CIs for R 0 . For illustrative purposes, we use our pooled estimates, which may represent a reasonable proxy for the state of knowledge as of January 23-26 ( Fig. 2A) . Comparing the models that include only some sources of uncertainty to the ""all"" model, we see that propagating error from the growth rate (which all but one of the studies reviewed did) is absolutely crucial: the middle bar (""GI mean""), which lacks growth-rate uncertainty, is relatively narrow. In this case, propagating error from the mean generation interval has negligible effect compared to propagating the uncertainty in r. Uncertainty in the generation-interval dispersion also has important effects as it determines the functional form of the relationship between r and R 0 (compare ""growth rate + GI mean"" with ""all""). For example, reducing the dispersion parameter κ from 1 (assuming exponentially distributed generation intervals) to 0 (assuming fixed generation intervals) changes the r-R 0 relationship from linear to exponential, therefore increasing the sensitivity of R 0 estimates to r andḠ.
As uncertainty associated with the exponential growth rate decreases, accounting for uncertainties in generation intervals becomes even more important (Fig. 2B) . Propagating error only from the growth rate gives very narrow confidence intervals in this case. Likewise, propagating errors from the growth rate and the mean generation interval gives wider but still too narrow confidence intervals. We expect this hypothetical example to better reflect more recent scenarios, as increased data availability will allow researchers to estimate r with more certainty. Figure 2 : Effects of r,Ḡ, and κ on the estimates of R 0 . We compare estimates of R 0 under five scenarios that propagate different combinations of uncertainties (A) based on our pooled estimates (µ r , µ G , and µ κ ) and (B) assuming a 4-fold reduction in uncertainty of our pooled estimate of the exponential growth rate (using (µ r + 3 × median(µ r ))/4, instead). base: R 0 estimates based on the median estimates of µ r , µ G , and µ κ . growth rate: R 0 estimates based on the the posterior distribution of µ r while using median estimates of µ G and µ κ . GI mean: R 0 estimates based on the the posterior distribution of µ G while using median estimates of µ r and µ κ . growth rate + GI mean: R 0 estimates based on the the joint posterior distributions of µ r and µ G while using a median estimate of µ κ . all: R 0 estimates based on the joint posterior distributions of µ r , µ G , and µ κ . Vertical lines represent the 95% confidence intervals.
We also compare the estimates of R 0 across different studies by replacing their values of r,Ḡ, and κ with our pooled estimates (µ r , µ G , and µ κ , respectively) one at a time and recalculating the basic reproductive number R 0 (Fig. 3) . This procedure allows us to assess the sensitivity of the estimates of R 0 across appropriate ranges of uncertainties. We find that incorporating uncertainties one at a time increases the width of the confidence intervals in all but 7 cases. We estimate narrower confidence intervals for Study 3, Study 6, and Study 7 when we account for proper uncertainties in the generation-interval dispersion because they assume a narrow generation-interval distribution (compare ""base"" with ""GI variation""); when higher values of κ are used, their estimates of R 0 become less sensitive to the values of r andḠ, giving narrower confidence intervals. We estimate narrower confidence 8 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

intervals for Study 5 and Study 7 when we account for proper uncertainties in the mean generation interval (compare ""base"" with ""GI mean"") because the range of uncertainty in the mean generation intervalḠ they consider is much wider than the pooled range (Fig. 1) . Substituting the reported r orḠ from Study 1 with our pooled estimates give narrower confidence intervals for similar reasons.
We find that accounting for uncertainties in the estimate of r has the largest effect on the estimates of R 0 in most cases (Fig. 3) . For example, recalculating R 0 for Study 7 by using our pooled estimate of r gives R 0 = 3.9 (95% CI: 2.3-8.6), which is much wider than the uncertainty range they reported (2.0-3.1). There are two explanations for this result. First, even though the exponential growth rate r and the mean generation intervalḠ have identical mathematical effects on R 0 in our framework (Eq. 2 in Methods), r is more influential in this case because it is associated with more uncertainty (Fig. 1) . Second, assuming a fixed generation interval (κ = 0) makes the estimate of R 0 too sensitive to r andḠ. One exception is Study 1: we find this estimate of R 0 is most sensitive to generation-interval dispersion κ. This is because Study 1 assumes an exponentially distributed generation interval (κ = 1): estimates that rely on this assumption make R 0 relatively insensitive and thus tend to have particularly narrow confidence intervals.
Finally, we incorporate all uncertainties by using posterior samples for µ r , µ G , and µ κ to recalculate R 0 and compare it with the reported R 0 estimates. Our estimated R 0 from the pooled distribution has a median of 2.9 (95% CI: 2.1-4.5). While the point estimate of R 0 is similar to other reported values from this date range, the confidence intervals are wider than all but one study. This result does not imply that assumptions based on the pooled estimate are too weak; we believe that this confidence interval more accurately reflects the level of uncertainties present in the information that was available when these models were fitted. In fact, because the pooled estimate does not account for overlap in data sources used by the models, we feel that it is more likely to be over-confident than under-confident. Our median estimate averages over the various studies, and therefore particular studies have higher or lower median estimates. We note in particular that, while the baseline example we used from Study 6 may appear to be an outlier, the authors of this study also explore different scenarios involving changes in reporting rate over time, under which their estimates of R 0 are similar to other reported estimates. Here, our focus is on estimating uncertainty, not on identifying potential explanations for these discrepancies.
Estimating the basic reproductive number R 0 is crucial for predicting the course of an outbreak and planning intervention strategies. Here, we use a gamma approximation (Park et al., 2019) to decompose R 0 estimates into three key quantities (r,Ḡ, and κ) and apply a multilevel Bayesian framework to compare estimates of R 0 for the novel coronavirus outbreak. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for uncertainties associated with the underlying generation-interval distributions, including uncertainties in the amount of dispersion in the generation intervals. Our analysis of individual studies shows that many 9 .

We replace the reported parameter values (growth rate r, GI meanḠ, and GI variation κ) with our corresponding pooled estimates (µ r , µ G , and µ κ ) one at a time and recalculate R 0 (growth rate, GI mean, and GI variation). The pooled estimate of R 0 is calculated from the joint posterior distribution of µ r , µ G , and µ κ (all); this corresponds to replacing all reported parameter values with our pooled estimates, which gives identical results across all studies. Horizontal dashed lines represent the 95% confidence intervals of our pooled estimate of R 0 . The reported R 0 estimates (base) have been adjusted to show the approximate 95% confidence interval using the probability distributions that we defined if they had relied on different measures for parameter uncertainties.
early estimates of R 0 rely on strong assumptions.
Of the seven studies that we reviewed, two of them directly fit their models to cumulative number of confirmed cases. This approach can be appealing because of its simplicity and apparent robustness, but fitting a model to cumulative incidence instead of raw incidence can both bias parameters and give overly narrow confidence intervals, if the resulting nonindependent error structures are not taken into account (Ma et al., 2014; King et al., 2015) . Naive fits to cumulative incidence data should therefore be avoided.
Many sources of noise affect real-world incidence data, including both dynamical, or ""process"", noise (randomness that directly or indirectly affects disease transmission); and observation noise (randomness underlying how many of the true cases are reported). Disease modelers face the choice of incorporating one or both of these in their data-fitting and 10 .

This is not always a serious problem, particularly if the goal is inferring parameters rather than directly making forecasts (Ma et al., 2014) . Modelers should however be aware of the possibility that ignoring one kind of error can give overly narrow confidence intervals (King et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2016) .
There are other important phenomena not covered by our simple framework. Examples that seem relevant to this outbreak include: changing reporting rates, reporting delays (including the effects of weekends and holidays), and changing generation intervals. For emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, there may be an early period of time when the reporting rate is very low due to limited awareness or diagnostic resources; for example, (Study 6) demonstrated that estimates of R 0 can change from 5.47 (95% CI: 4.16-7.10) to 3.30 (95% CI: 2.73-3.96) when they assume 2-fold changes in the reporting rate between January 17, when the official diagnostic guidelines were released (World Health Organization, 2020b), and January 20. Delays between key epidemiological timings (e.g., infection, symptom onset, and detection) can also shift the shape of an observed epidemic curve and, therefore, affect parameter estimates as well as predictions of the course of an outbreak (Tariq et al., 2019) . Even though a constant delay between infection and detection may not affect the estimate of the growth rate, it can still affect the associated confidence intervals. Finally, generation intervals can become shorter throughout an epidemic as intervention strategies, such as quarantine, can reduce the infectious period (Hethcote et al., 2002) . Accounting for these factors is crucial for making accurate inferences.
Here, we focused on the estimates of R 0 that were published within a very short time frame (January 23-26). During early phases of an outbreak, it is reasonable to assume that the epidemic grows exponentially (Anderson and May, 1991) . However, as the number of susceptible individuals decreases, the epidemic will saturate, and estimates of r used for R 0 should account for the possibility that r is decreasing through time. Although our analysis only reflects a snapshot of a fast-moving epidemic, we expect certain lessons to hold: confidence intervals must combine different sources of uncertainty. In fact, as epidemics progress and more data becomes available, it is likely that inferences about exponential growth rate (and other epidemiological parameters) will become more precise; thus the risk of over-confidence when uncertainty about the generation-interval distribution is neglected will become greater.
We strongly emphasize the value of attention to accurate characterization of the transmission chains via contact tracing and better statistical frameworks for inferring generationinterval distributions from such data (Britton and Scalia Tomba, 2019) . A combined effort between public-health workers and modelers in this direction will be crucial for predicting the course of an epidemic and controlling it. We also emphasize the value of transparency from modelers. Model estimates during an outbreak, even in pre-prints, should include code links and complete explanations. We suggest using methods based on open-source tools allow for maximal reproducibility.
In summary, we have provided a basis for comparing exponential-growth based estimates of R 0 and its associated uncertainty in terms of three components: the exponential growth rate, mean generation interval, and generation interval dispersion. We hope this framework will help researchers understand and reconcile disparate estimates of disease transmission 11 .

10138816c67a562b55bc9c2b882b62c81fc4b062,,"A novel coronavirus, formerly called 2019-nCoV, or SARS-CoV-2 by ICTV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) caused an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, now officially called COVID-19 by WHO (coronavirus disease 2019, by World Health Organization) first in Wuhan, Hubei province in Dec., 2019 and then rapidly spread out in the whole China 1 . As of 24:00 Feb.
13th, 2020 (Beijing Time), there are over 60, 000 reported cases (including more than 1, 000 death report) in China, among which, over 80% are from Hubei province and over 50% from Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province 2,3 .
The central government of China as well as all local governments, including Hubei, has tightened preventive measures to curb the spreading of COVID-19 since Jan. 2020. Many cities in Hubei province have been locked down and many measures, such as tracing close contacts, quarantining infected cases, promoting social consensus on self-protection like wearing face mask in public area, etc. However, until the finishing of this manuscript, the epidemic is still ongoing and the daily confirmed cases maintain at a high level.
During this anti-epidemic battle, besides medical and biological research, theoretical studies based on either statistics or mathematical modeling may also play a non-negligible role in understanding the epidemic characteristics of the outbreak, in forecasting the inflection point and ending time, and in deciding the measures to curb the spreading.
For this purpose, in the early stage many efforts have been devoted to estimate key epidemic parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, doubling time and serial interval, in which the statistics models are mainly used [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Due to the limitation of detection methods and restricted diagnostic criteria, asymptomatic or mild patients are possibly excluded from the confirmed cases. To this end, some methods have been proposed to estimate untraced contacts 10 , undetected international cases 11 , or the actual infected cases in Wuhan and Hubei province based on statistics models 12 , or the epidemic outside Hubei province and overseas 6, [13] [14] [15] . With the improvement of clinic treatment of patients as well as more strict methods stepped up for containing the spread, many researchers investigate the effect of such changes by statistical reasoning 16, 17 and stochastic simulation 18, 19 .

Among them, the classical susceptible exposed infectious recovered model (SEIR) is the most widely adopted one for characterizing the epidemic of COVID-19 outbreak in both China and other countries 25 . Based on SEIR model, one can also assess the effectiveness of various measures since the outbreak 23, 24, [26] [27] [28] , which seems to be a difficult task for general statistics methods. SEIR model was also utilized to compare the effects of lock-down of Hubei province on the transmission dynamics in Wuhan and Beijing 29 .
As the dynamical model can reach interpretable conclusions on the outbreak, a cascade of SEIR models are developed to simulate the processes of transmission from infection source, hosts, reservoir to human 30 . There are also notable generalizations of SEIR model for evaluation of the transmission risk and prediction of patient number, in which model, each group is divided into two subpopulations, the quarantined and unquarantined 23, 24 . The extension of classical SEIR model with delays 31,32 is another routine to simulate the incubation period and the period before recovery. However, due to the lack of official data and the change of diagnostic caliber in the early stage of the outbreak, most early published models were either too complicated to avoid the overfitting problem, or the parameters were estimated based on limited and less accurate data, resulting in questionable predictions.
In this work, we carefully collect the epidemic data from the authoritative sources: the Such a design aims to minimize the influence of Hubei province and Wuhan city on the data set due to their extremely large infected populations compared to other regions.

A. Generalized SEIR model {S(t), P (t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t), D(t)} denoting at time t the respective number of the susceptible cases, insusceptible cases, exposed cases (infected but not yet be infectious, in a latent period), infectious cases (with infectious capacity and not yet be quarantined), quarantined cases (confirmed and infected), recovered cases and closed cases (or death). The adding of a new quarantined sate is driven by data, which together with the recovery state takes replace of the original R state in the classical SEIR model. Their relations are given in Fig. 1 and characterized by a group of ordinary differential equations (or difference equations if we consider discrete time, see SI). Constant N = S + P + E + I + Q + R + D is the total population in a certain region. The coefficients {α, β, γ −1 , δ −1 , λ(t), κ(t)} represent the protection rate, infection rate, average latent time, average quarantine time, cure rate, and mortality rate, separately.

In this case, the basic reproduction
It is noted that here we assume the cure rate λ and the mortality rate κ are both time dependent. As confirmed in Fig. 2a -d, the cure rate λ(t) is gradually increasing with the time, while the mortality rate κ(t) quickly decreases to less than 1% and becomes stabilized after Jan. 30th. This phenomenon is likely raised by the assistance of other emergency medical teams, the application of new drugs, etc. Furthermore, the average contact number of an infectious person is calculated in Fig. 2e-f and could provide some clue on the infection rate. It is clearly seen that the average contact number is basically stable over time, but shows a remarkable difference among various regions, which could be attributed to different quarantine policies and implements inside and outside Hubei (or Wuhan), since a less severe region is more likely to inquiry the close contacts of a confirmed case. A similar regional difference is observed for the severe condition rate too. In Fig. 2g -h, Hubei and Wuhan overall show a much higher severe condition rate than Shanghai. Although it is generally expected that the patients need a period of time to become infectious, to be quarantined, or to be recovered from illness, but we do not find a strong evidence for the necessity of including time delay (see SI for more details). As a result, the time-delayed equations are not considered in the current work for simplicity.
According to the daily official reports of NHC of China, the cumulative numbers of quarantined cases, recovered cases and closed cases are available in public. However, since the latter two are directly related to the first one through the time dependent recovery rate and mortality rate, the numbers of quarantined cases Q(t) plays a key role in our modeling.
A similar argument applies to the number of insusceptible cases too. Furthermore, as the accurate numbers of exposed cases and infectious cases are very hard to determine, they will be treated as hidden variables during the study.
Leaving alone the time dependent parameters λ(t) and κ(t), there are four unknown coefficients {α, β, γ −1 , δ −1 } and two initial conditions {E 0 , I 0 } about the hidden variables (other initial conditions are known from the data) have to be extracted from the time series 5 All rights reserved.

Such an optimization problem could be solved automatically by using the simulating annealing algorithm (see SI for details). A major difficulty is how to overcome the overfitting problem.
To this end, we firstly prefix the latent time γ −1 , which is generally estimated within several days 5, 33, 34 . And then for each fixed γ −1 , we explore its influence on other parameters (β = 1 nearly unchanged), initial values, as well as the population dynamics of quarantined cases and infected cases during best fitting. From Fig. 3a -b, to produce the same outcome, the protection rate α and the reciprocal of the quarantine time δ −1 are both decreasing with the latent time γ −1 , which is consistent with the fact that longer latent time requires longer quarantine time. Meanwhile, the initial values of exposed cases and infectious cases are increasing with the latent time. Since E 0 and I 0 include asymptomatic patients, they both should be larger than the number of quarantined cases. Furthermore, as the time period between the starting date of our simulation (Jan. 20th) and the initial outbreak of COVID-19 (generally believed to be earlier than Jan. 1st) is much longer than the latent time (3-6 days), E 0 and I 0 have to be close to each other, which makes only their sum E 0 +I 0 6 All rights reserved.

An additional important finding is that in all cases β is always very close to 1, which agrees with the observation that COVID-19 has an extremely strong infectious ability. Nearly every unprotected person will be infected after a direct contact with the COVID-19 patients 5,33,34 .
As a summary, we conclude that once the latent time γ −1 is fixed, the fitting accuracy on the time series data {Q(t)} basically depends on the values of α, δ −1 and E 0 + I 0 . And based on a reasonable estimation on the total number of infected cases (see Fig. 3c-d) , the latent time is finally determined as 2 days.
In order to further evaluate the influence of other fitting parameters on the long-term forecast, we perform sensitivity analysis on the data of Wuhan (results for other regions are similar and not shown) by systematically varying the values of unknown coefficients 35, 36 .
As shown in Fig. 3e-f , the predicted total infected cases at the end of epidemic, as well as the the inflection point, at which the basic reproduction number is less than 1 6 , both show a positive correlation with the infection rate β and the quarantined time δ −1 and a negative correlation with the protection rate α. These facts agree with the common sense and highlight the necessity of self-protection (increase α and decrease β), timely disinfection (increase α and decrease β), early quarantine (decrease δ −1 ), etc. An exception is found for the initial total infected cases. Although a larger value of E 0 + I 0 could substantially increase the final total infected cases, it shows no impact on the inflection point, which could be learnt from the formula of basic reproduction number.
We apply our pre-described generalized SEIR model to interpret the public data on the cumulative numbers of quarantined cases, recovered cases and closed cases from Jan. 20th to Feb. 9th, which are published daily by NHC of China since Jan. 20th. Our preliminary study includes five different regions, i.e. the Mainland * , Hubei * , Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai.

There are several remarkable facts could be immediately learnt from Table 1 . Firstly, the protection rate of Wuhan is significantly lower than other regions, showing many infected cases may not yet be well quarantined until Feb. 9th (the smaller α for Wuhan does not necessarily mean people in Wuhan pay less attention to self-protection, but more likely due to the higher mixing ratio of susceptible cases with infectious cases). Similarly, although the average protection rate for Hubei * is higher than that of Wuhan, it is still significantly lower than other regions.

Again, the quarantine time for Wuhan and Hubei * are the longest. Finally, the estimated number of total infected cases on Jan. 20th in five regions are all significantly larger than one, suggesting the COVID-19 has already spread out nationwide at that moment. We will come back to this point in the next part. the initial values for exposed cases and infectious cases separately. The time-dependent cure rate λ(t) and mortality rate κ(t) can be read out from Fig. 2 and are given in SI.
Most importantly, with the model and parameters in hand, we can carry out simulations for a longer time and forecast the potential tendency of the COVID-19 epidemic. In Fig.   4 and Fig. 5a -b, the predicted cumulative number of quarantined cases and the current number of exposed cases plus infectious cases are plotted for next 30 days as well as for a shorter period of next 13 days.

10th to 15th are marked in red spots and taken as a direct validation. Overall, except Wuhan, the validation data show a well agreement with our forecast and all fall into the 95% confidence interval (shaded area). And we are delighted to see most of them are lower than our predictions, showing the nationwide anti-epidemic measures in China come into play. While for Wuhan city (and also Hubei province), due to the inclusion of suspected cases with clinical diagnosis into confirmed cases (12364 cases for Wuhan and 968 cases for Hubei * on Feb. 12th) announced by NHC of China since Feb. 12th during the preparation of our manuscript, there is a sudden jump in the quarantined cases.

Towards the epidemic of COVID-19, our basic predictions are summarized as follows:
1. Based on optimistic estimation, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Beijing and Shanghai would soon be ended within two weeks (since Feb. 15th). While for most parts of mainland, the success of anti-epidemic will be no later than the middle of March. The situation in Wuhan is still very severe, at least based on public data until Feb. 15th.
We expect it will end up at the beginning of April. are not included into parameter estimation). By coincidence, on the same day, we witnessed a sudden jump in the number of confirmed cases due to a relaxed diagnosis caliber, meaning more suspected cases will receive better medical care and have much lower chances to spread virus. Besides, Wuhan local government announced the completion of community survey on all confirmed cases, suspected cases and close contacts in the whole city.
Besides the forecast, the early trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak is also critical for our understanding on its epidemic as well as future prevention. To this end, by adopting the shooting method, we carry out inverse inference to explore the early epidemic dynamics 10 All rights reserved.

With respect to the parameters and initial conditions listed in Table 1 , we make an astonishing finding that, for all three cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 all point to 20-25 days before Jan. 20th (the starting date for public data and our modeling). It means the epidemic of COVID-19 in these regions is no later than Jan. 1st (see Fig. 5d ), in agreement with reports by Li et al. 5, 33, 34 . And in this stage (from Jan. 1st to Jan. 20th), the number of total infected cases follows a nice exponential curve with the doubling time around 2 days. This in some way explains why statistics studies with either exponential functions or logistic models could work very well on early limited data points. Furthermore, we notice the number of infected cases based on inverse inference is much larger than the reported confirmed cases in Wuhan city before Jan. 20th.
In this study, we propose a generalized SEIR model to analyze the epidemic of COVID-19, which was firstly reported in Wuhan last December and then quickly spread out nationwide in China. Our model properly incorporates the intrinsic impact of hidden exposed and infectious cases on the entire procedure of epidemic, which is difficult for traditional statistics analysis. A new quarantined state, together with the recovery state, takes replace of the original R state in the classical SEIR model and correctly accounts for the daily reported confirmed infected cases and recovered cases.
Based on detailed analysis of the public data of NHC of China from Jan. 20th to Feb. 9th, we estimate several key parameters for COVID-19, like the latent time, the quarantine time and the basic reproduction number in a relatively reliable way, and predict the inflection point, possible ending time and final total infected cases for Hubei, Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, etc. Overall, the epidemic situations for Beijing and Shanghai are optimistic, which are expected to end up within two weeks (from Feb. 15th, 2020). Meanwhile, for most parts of mainland including the majority of cities in Hubei province, it will be no later than the middle of March. We should also point out that the situation in Wuhan city is still very severe. More effective policies and more efforts on medical care and clinical research are eagerly needed. We expect the final success of anti-epidemic will be reached at the beginning 11 All rights reserved.

Furthermore, by inverse inference, we find that the outbreak of this epidemic in Mainland, Hubei, and Wuhan can all be dated back to 20-25 days ago with respect to Jan. 20th, in other words the end of Dec. 2019, which is consistent with public reports. Although we lack the knowledge on the first infected case, our inverse inference may still be helpful for understanding the epidemic of COVID-19 and preventing similar virus in the future.

10424da2599f0258bfaf71a3186b999ab2d747d0,"Many mammalian carnivore species have been reduced to small, isolated populations by habitat destruction, fragmentation, poaching, and human conflict. Their limited genetic variability and increased exposure to domestic animals such as dogs place them at risk of further losses from infectious diseases. In India, domestic and feral dogs are associated with villages in and around protected areas, and may serve as reservoirs of pathogens to the carnivores within. India's Kanha Tiger Reserve (KTR) is home to a number of threatened and endangered mammalian carnivores including tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), wolf (Canis lupus), and dhole (Cuon alpinus). It also has more than 150 villages with associated dog populations. We found that dog populations ranged from 14 to 45/village (3.7 to 23.7/km 2 ), and did not vary with village area, human population size, or distance from the KTR's core area, though they all increased between summer 2014 and winter 2015, primarily through reproduction. No dog tested positive for rabies but seroprevalence levels to three other generalist viral pathogens were high in summer (N=67) and decreased somewhat by winter (N=168): canine parvovirus (83.6% to 68.4%), canine distemper virus (50.7% to 30.4%) and canine adenovirus (41.8% to 30.9%).
The declines in seroprevalence were primarily due to new recruitments by birth and these were not yet exposed to the viruses. Wild carnivores frequently entered the villages, as shown by tracks, scats, kills and other indicators, and the dogs are known to leave the villages so that encounters between dogs and wild carnivores may be common. We conclude that there is a large population of unvaccinated dogs in and around Kanha Tiger Reserve, with high levels of seroprevalence to pathogens with broad host ranges and these dogs which interact with wild carnivores, therefore posing a high risk of disease spillover to the wild carnivores.","approximately 150 villages in the buffer zone (1,134 km 2 ), where regulated human activities are 25 allowed, and eight villages in the core zone ('core') (940 km 2 ), where stricter regulations on 26 human activity are implemented. All these villages support dog populations (DeFries, Karanth & 27 Pareeth, 2010) . In India, dogs near protected areas threaten wild animals through predation and 28 competition (Home, Bhatnagar & Vanak, 2017) ; and may serve as reservoirs of pathogens that 29 threaten wild carnivores. Majority of dogs in KTR are semi-owned and associate with household 30 but are unrestrained. A few are owned and restrained, and the rest are feral. No village dogs were 31 vaccinated (V. C. pers. comm. with park authorities and owners) so they pose a potential disease 32 spillover risk to carnivores. 33
Carnivores in KTR frequent the villages to prey on dogs (Karanth et al., 2013) and 34 livestock (Miller et al., 2015) , while dogs enter the core with or without their owners. As a 35 result, these animals can interact directly through scavenging on carcasses or predation or, 36 indirectly through scats or spray marks; in ways that can transmit pathogens. We predict that 37 these interactions will be more frequent in villages that are closer to the core (as in Chile) (Torres 38 & Prado, 2010) or that are larger since they may support more dogs. Finally, as some pathogens 39 have common routes of transmission or suppress the immune response, we predict that there will 40 be elevated rates of co-exposure, amplifying the threat (Griffiths et al., 2011) . We conducted 41 6 contact rate with wild carnivores. We randomly selected five villages with centers < 2 km from 70 the core boundary (henceforth 'near') and four villages (summer), and then five (winter) with 71 centers > 6 km from the core boundary ('far') ( Fig. 1) . All villages were sampled in both 72 seasons except one near village that was replaced in winter and one far village that was added in 73 winter (Table 2) . After establishing the active periods for dogs (6:00-9:00 AM & 5:00-6:30 PM 74 in summer; 7:00-9:00 AM & 4:00-5:30 PM in winter), we conducted non-invasive photographic 75 surveys of dogs using a Nikon D3000 digital camera and 80-200 mm lens, on a motorcycle at < 76 20 km/h on roads and on foot in alleys. We noted individual dog's sex (males by descended 77 testicles), age category (juveniles < 1 year or adults by asking the owners and/or estimation), and 78 coat patterns. Each survey was conducted over two consecutive days (a ""mark"" and ""recapture"" 79 in each village) in summer and three consecutive days (a ""mark"" and two morning and two 80 afternoon ""recaptures"") in winter. We measured the area of each village by tracking its villages that were sampled in summer and winter; the inset shows the location of KTR in India. 88 We collected blood samples from dogs in all surveyed villages to estimate the 89 seroprevalence of rabies, CPV, CDV, and CAV. In summer, we collected blood 90 opportunistically from 67 dogs (42 males and 25 females). In winter, we collected blood from 91 five male and five female adults and four male and four female juveniles from each village, 92 except for three near and two far villages where we could only capture three males and three 93 female juveniles. 35 dogs were sampled in both seasons. Dogs less than four months of age 94
were excluded to rule out presence of maternal antibodies (Greene, 1994 seronegative (S0) and seropositive (S1and above; specifically, S1 & S2 = 'low titers', S3 = 115 'medium titers' and S4+ = 'high titers'). All samples seropositive for CPV and CDV were tested 116 for the viral nucleic acid using PCR, along with positive controls. We did not test samples 117 seropositive for CAV for the virus as we lacked a positive control. The methods for DNA and 118 RNA extraction and PCR analyses are described in Supporting Information S1. 119
We opportunistically recorded signs of carnivores (direct sightings, photographs, scats 121 and, footprints) in surveyed villages as 'encounters' over 60 day periods in both seasons. 122
Naturalists from KTR confirmed the identifications based on scats. On five occasions, we had 123 permission from the KTR Forest Department to install camera traps (Capture IR, 5 MP camera, 124
Cuddeback, Greenbay, WI, USA, 54115) near carcasses of livestock killed by tigers. We 125 recorded the geographical location of each carnivore encounter and collected only once from 126 each location to avoid duplication. This method provides a minimum estimate of the contact rate, 127 since many carnivores are nocturnal and can enter villages undetected.

Since, the dogs are territorial (Pal, 2003) and our surveys were conducted over 132 two or three consecutive days in each village, we assumed the individual populations were 133 closed during survey. Also, since we used non-invasive means to identify dogs, we assumed 134 there was no loss of marks and no change in behavior following the first ""capture"". Using 135 CAPTURE, we compared four models that differ in their assumptions of capture probability: that We used Fisher's two-tailed exact test to examine the relation between seroprevalence of 148 each pathogen and sex and age category of the dogs, and also to test non-random patterns of co-149 exposure. We tested for the difference in seroprevalence for near and far villages (only for 150 winter). We calculated odds ratio (OR) for all significant relationships, which tells the likelihood 151 of seroprevalence given the presence or absence of other conditions, here, the sex and age class 152 of the dogs, and the presence of other pathogens. All analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS 153 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/360271 doi: bioRxiv preprint
The villages surveyed ranged in area from 2.06-9.80 km 2 and in human population size 156 from 142 to 1,324 (Table 2) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/360271 doi: bioRxiv preprint respectively in summer, dropping slightly to 28.5% and 26.2% in winter (Fig. 2b) . Juveniles 178 constituted 23% and 28.5% of the population in near and far villages respectively in summer 179 rising to 36.1% and 34% in winter (Fig. 2c) . None of these differences, in the number of females 180 or juveniles by proximity to the core or by season, was statistically significant. In the eight 181 villages surveyed in both seasons, 84 of the 155 dogs photographed and identified in summer 182 were still detected in winter (54.2 %). 58% of these 84 dogs were from near villages and 42% 183
were from far villages. The recapture rate was lower for females (32% of 84) and juveniles (40% 184 of 84 recaptures) which were classified as adults in winter. 185 186 187
The seroprevalence of CPV, CDV and CAV were all high in summer and declined in 188 winter: CPV decreased from 83.6% to 68.4%, CDV decreased from 50.7% to 30.4% and CAV 189 decreased from 41.8% to 30.9%. There was no significant effect of age or sex to the 190 seroprevalence in all villages in summer (Table 3 ) and in near villages in winter (Table 4) . 191
However, in far villages in winter, adults were more likely to be seropositive than juveniles for 192 CPV (P = 0.003), CDV (P = 0.003) and CAV (P = 0.01) ( Table 4 ). The proportion of the dogs 193 with antibody titers of S4+, S3 and S1 varied with the pathogen (Supporting Information S4). 194
Dogs that tested positive for CPV antibodies were most often in the high range (S4+) in both 195
seasons, whereas dogs that tested positive for CDV and CAV were predominantly in the 196 moderate range (S3) in both seasons except for dogs in near villages that were more often S4+ in 197 greater proportion as compared to far villages in winter (Supporting Information S5). 198
In winter, dogs that were seropositive for any one pathogen were more likely to be 199 seropositive for one or both of the others (Table 5 ). This trend was statistically significant in far 200 .

In the far villages, 201 dogs that were seropositive for any combination of two out of three viruses was more likely to be 202 positive for third one. For example, if a sample tested seropositive for CPV and CDV, it is 13.72 203 times more likely to be seropositive for CAV (P = 0.001, OR = 13.72). 204
Of the 35 dogs that were surveyed and sampled in both seasons, all 19 dogs that were 205 seropositive for CPV in summer remained so in winter, while 7 more (43.7% of 16) became 206 seropositive by then. Similarly, all 13 dogs that were seropositive for CDV in summer remained 207 so in winter, and three more showed positive seroconversions (13% of 22). For CAV, of nine 208 dogs that were seropositive in summer, one showed negative seroconversion (11.1%) while one 209 of the others showed a positive seroconversion (3.9%) by winter. Results of the RT-PCR tests, 210 indicated active CDV infection for a two-year-old female and a six-year-old male and active 211 CPV infection in an eight-month old male dog (Supporting Information S1). 212
We had direct and camera trap sightings of wild carnivores within the villages, as well as 213 a variety of indirect records including calls, footprints and scats (Table 6 ). There were more such 214 records in near villages (16 summer, 18 winter) than in far villages (6 summer, 4 winter). 215
The potential of disease spillover from dogs to carnivores in KTR is significant as dogs 217 are present in large numbers, are exposed to infectious viruses, and come in direct or indirect 218 contact with carnivores. The average number of dogs in KTR villages that were sampled in both 219 seasons, was 21 in summer and 17 in winter in case of near villages, and in the far villages there 220 were 29 dogs in summer and 27 dogs in winter.

Rabies transmission from dogs therefore likely poses a serious 248 threat to carnivores in India but was not detected in our study because it is highly and quickly 249 lethal (Tepsumethanon et al., 2004) . However, most dogs had been exposed to CPV (83.6% particular are bigger threat as they are more prone to suffer from high mortality, malnutrition, 307 and disease (Sowemimo, 2009 ). Very few dogs photographed in summer were re-sighted in 308 winter in our survey, possibly due to high mortality of these dogs. Our study does not 309 incorporate any seroprevalence data from feral dogs, which may be higher along with the 310 associated mortality. Feral dogs may have more frequent contact with carnivores making them a 311 greater unknown threat. 312
Fragmentation of carnivore habitats due to anthropogenic activities leads to intense 313 interactions between humans, domestic carnivores and wild carnivores (Thorne & Williams, 314 .

Increasing globalization of commerce, finance, production, and services has fostered rapid movement of people, animals, plants, and food [1] . With the transportation of people and goods comes the widespread dispersion of pathogens that cause infectious diseases and the vectors that may spread them [2] . Outbreaks that begin in the most remote parts of the world can now spread swiftly to urban centers and to countries far away with dangerous, global consequences [3] . For instance, population mobility across borders played a critical role in the spread of Ebola virus in West Africa during the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic [4] . A more recent example is the 2016 yellow Fever outbreak in Angola [5] . Infected travellers from Angola reached China, representing the first ever reported cases of yellow fever in Asia [6] .
Early detection and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks through passive or active collection of surveillance data can help public health officials initiate interventions such as removing contaminated food sources, isolating affected individuals or launching vaccination campaigns. However, any data collection method involves trade-offs between speed, accuracy and costs. Data collected through traditional surveillance, for example via public health infrastructure, are generally reliable but are resource intensive and are therefore typically available for upstream analysis with an (understandable) delay [7] .
In the past three decades, the internet has grown at a staggering pace, with approximately half of the world's population accessing internet in 2017 [8] . The rapid growth of the internet has fostered a corresponding increase in tools for internet based disease detection and monitoring that lie at the other end of the spectrum. Digital disease surveillance consists of monitoring online information sources to collate relevant information about diseases. The sources of information can be formal such as advisories posted by a ministry of health, or informal such as news media items, blogs or tweets. Digital surveillance makes data collection less expensive and time consuming but the acquired data often contain more noise than those collected through traditional public health surveillance. While traditional surveillance systems report on select pathogens and depend on a well-functioning public health infrastructure, digital surveillance in contrast typically monitor a wide range of pathogens using little to no additional infrastructure. Thus, digital surveillance tools can play a significant role in the rapid recognition of public health emergencies [9, 10] .
The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED, www.promedmail.org) was one of the first entrants in the field of digital disease surveillance. ProMED was created in 1994 as a surveillance network to provide early warning of emerging and re-emerging infections [11] . ProMED collates information from various sources that include media reports, official reports, local observers, and a network of clinicians throughout the world. The reports generated through bottom-up surveillance are reviewed by a team of subject matter experts before being posted to the ProMED network. ProMED now provides free email based reports on outbreaks to over 70,000 subscribers in at least 185 countries.
HealthMap (www.healthmap.org) is another widely used tool for disease outbreak monitoring. In addition to ProMED alerts, HealthMap utilises online news aggregators, eyewitness reports and other formal and informal sources of information and allows for visualisation of alerts on a map [12] . The surveillance data collected by HealthMap has been incorporated into the Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) surveillance system, developed by WHO. Both ProMED and HealthMap are used by key public health bodies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and surveillance process. Compiling the data, conducting analyses, and generating reports that are easily understood and actionable are equally important. For instance, one of the ProMED outbreak analysts reported in March 2014 on the likely spread of Zika to the Americas [13] , well before the epidemic surfaced in South America in February 2015. However, lacking an easy to use and openly accessible tool to quantify and visualize the reported risk of disease spread, this report did not have any significant impact on public health resource allocation and decision making. While there has been a growing interest in using various internet data streams for epidemiological investigations [14, 15] and in using data from digital surveillance tools [16] , there is as yet a dearth of a framework that can automatically combine such data with other streams of information, analyse them in a statistically robust manner, and produce actionable reports, particularly in real time during an outbreak where such analyses would be most useful.
In this study, we propose a new statistical framework to estimate and visualize risks posed by outbreak events using digital surveillance data. Our approach relies on a relatively simple statistical framework that integrates multiple data streams to predict the future incidence trajectory, and quantifies spatial heterogeneity in the risk of disease spread. In this paper, we present the model implemented in this framework and as a case study, we report the analysis of ProMED and HealthMap data for the 2013-16 West African Ebola epidemic. To assess the robustness of the digital surveillance data, we also applied the framework to the data collated by WHO and made available at the end of the epidemic. We present a comparison of the near real-time ProMED/HealthMap data with the retrospective WHO data and the results of the spatio-temporal analysis carried out on these three data sources.
Our analysis based solely on epidemic data available through ProMED/HealthMap provides a realistic appraisal of their strengths and weaknesses, especially if used in near real-time forecasting.
ods for details). The raw and processed data from ProMED and HealthMap for all countries included in the feed are available in the Github repository for this article. There were substantial differences between the incidence time series derived from the three data sources, particularly at the peak of the epidemic. There may be multiple reasons underpinning such discrepancy, including potential variability in digital surveillance reporting during the course of the epidemic. It is also worth highlighting that the WHO data used here are an extensively cleaned version of the data collected during the epidemic [17, 18] , published more than a year after the epidemic was declared to be over. Moreover, while ProMED and HealthMap did not record probable cases for this epidemic, the WHO data contained confirmed, probable and suspected cases. However, despite these discrepancies, the weekly incidence derived from ProMED and HealthMap was moderately to highly correlated with that reported by WHO later (Pearson's correlation coefficients aggregated across the three countries 0.44 and 0.74 respectively, p value < 0.001, also see Fig 2 for weekly trends).
To broadly assess the extent to which such discrepancies in incidence would impact the quantification of transmissibility throughout the epidemic, we estimated the time-varying transmissibility, measured by the reproduction number R t (the average number of secondary cases at time t per infected individual [19] ), using the incidence from each of the three data sources (Fig 1) . R t was estimated independently for each country using the R package EpiEstim [20] over a sliding time window of 4 weeks. There were substantial differences in the estimates of R t according to the incidence data source used ( Fig 1B) . The correlation between the median R t estimates on sliding 4-week windows from ProMED or HealthMap data with the estimates from WHO data varied from weak (0.30, between reproduction number from WHO and ProMED in Guinea) to very strong (0.72, between reproduction number from WHO and ProMED in Sierra Leone, Fig 3) .
To forecast incidence at time t in location j (I t j ), we fitted a spatially explicit branching process model to the daily incidence in all locations up to t − 1, using an extension of the renewal equation as the likelihood [19] :
where the matrix p i→j characterises the spatial spread between locations i and j based on a gravity model [21] , R t i (the reproduction number) reflects transmissibility in location i at time t, and ω is the typical infectiousness profile of a case over time after infection (see Methods for details).
The ability of the model to robustly predict future outbreak trajectory was limited and depended on the data source (Fig 2) as well as on the time window used for inference (calibration window) and the forecast horizon. Results using a 2-week calibration window and a 4-week forecast horizon using ProMED data are presented in the main text (see Figs 6 and 7 for other forecast horizons and calibration windows). Overall, 48.7% of weekly observed incidence across all three countries were included in the 95% forecast interval (49.3% and 57.5% for HealthMap and WHO respectively, SI Table 1 ). Typically, model forecasts were 0.5 times lower or higher than the observed incidence (95% CrI 0.0 -32.0) based on the median relative mean absolute error (Fig 3D) , see Methods for details). We found no evidence of systematic bias in any week of the forecast horizon (median bias 0.12, Fig 3A) .
Typically, individual forecasts were within 17.0% (95% CrI 0 -80%) of the median forecast (based on the median and 95% CrI for relative sharpness, Fig 3B, see Methods for details).
As expected, the robustness of forecasts (both accuracy and precision) decreased over the forecast horizon ( Fig 3C) . In the first week of the forecast window, 58.0% of observed values (across the three countries) were within the 95% forecasts interval, reducing to 49.4%, 42.3% and 45.0% in the second, third and fourth weeks of the forecast horizon.
The model performance varied depending on the country and the phase of the epidemic, defined as ""growing"", ""declining"", and ""stable"" depending on R t estimates (see Methods). In general, the model performance was best in the stable phase with 66.7% of the observations contained in the 95% forecasts interval (versus 40.2% and 30.8% in the declining and growing phases respectively, SI Table 1 ). However the forecast uncertainty was largest in the stable phase and smallest in the growing phase ( Fig 3B) . Importantly, in the growing phase the model tended to over-predict while under-predicting in the declining phase ( Fig 3A) .
Overall, the model performed moderately better using WHO data compared to ProMED and HealthMap data (Fig 33) and with shorter calibration windows (Fig 32) .
Although our model was not always able to robustly predict the future incidence in the three mainly affected countries, we found that it allowed to robustly predict the presence or absence of cases in all countries in Africa up to a week in advance. For each week and each country in Africa, our model generated an alert if the predicted incidence (using a predetermined percentile of the forecast interval) was greater than 0. We classified an alert for a given week as a true alert when the observed incidence was also greater than 0, as a false alert when no cases were observed, and as a missed alert if cases were observed but were not predicted by the model. Using different percentiles of the forecast (e.g., the median or the 95 th percentile) yielded different rates of true, false and missed alerts, which were summarised in a ROC curve ( Fig 4A) . Overall, our model achieved high sensitivity (i.e., true alert rate) but variable specificity (i.e., 1 -false alert rate). Maximising the average between sensitivity and specificity led to 93.7% sensitivity and 96.0% specificity at 42.5% threshold ( Fig 4A) . The sensitivity of the model remained high over longer forecast horizon while the specificity deteriorated with more false alerts being raised 4 week ahead (Fig 47) . Both the sensitivity and the specificity of the model remained high when the analysis was restricted to all countries in Africa other than the three majorly affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) . The average of sensitivity and specificity was maximum at 92.5% threshold in this case with 85.7% sensitivity and 81.7% specificity (Fig 48) . The model exhibited high sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (82.0%) in predicting presence of cases in weeks following a week with no observed cases in all countries in Africa (Fig 49) at 93% threshold (similarly chosen to maximise the average between sensitivity and specificity). Out of the 9 one-week ahead missed alerts in this case, 3 are in Liberia towards the end of the epidemic, after Liberia had been declared Ebola free on two separate occasions [22, 23] . The serial interval distribution that we have used does not account for very long intervals between infections such as that associated with sexual transmission. Using the latest available data on pairs of primary and secondary infections and models that allow for more heterogeneity in the distribution of cases e.g., using Negative Binomial distributions could potentially improve the assessment of risk of spread in such cases [24, 25] .
The choice of a threshold at which to raise an alert is subjective and involves a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. In general, using a high threshold to raise an alert leads to high sensitivity with a reasonably high specificity (Fig 50) . The cut-off for raising an alert can be informed by the relative costs of missed and false alerts potentially using a higher cut-off when the observed incidence is low. It is also worth noting that where our model failed to raise an alert in a week, either a true or a false alert had been raised in the recent weeks in all but one instance, indicating a potential risk of spread of the epidemic to that country.
These results suggest that the model is able to capture and even anticipate the spatial spread of the epidemic. Importantly, as the model is fitted to data from any of the three data sources accumulating over the course of the epidemic, it is able to predict the presence of cases relatively early in the epidemic (Fig 51) when such inputs would be particularly useful.
Together with providing operational outputs such as the predicted shortterm incidence in currently affected countries or the risk of spread to neighbouring countries, our method also provides near real-time estimates of parameters underlying the transmission model. First, the reproduction number R t for each affected country is estimated over the time-window of inference, here over the most recent two weeks (Fig 2) , second row). We found that these near real-time estimates of R t were in good agreement with retrospective estimates obtained using the entire incidence time-series (Fig 2, bottom row, correlation coefficients varying between 0.58 and 0.90, Fig 5) .
The risk of spatial spread in our model relies on estimating movement patterns of infectious cases. Our method also provides estimates of the probability of a case staying within a country throughout their infectious period, and the extent to which distance between two locations affects the flow of infectious cases between them. The real-time estimates of these parameters over the course of the epidemic (Fig 34) , suggest that while the relative flow of cases between locations did not vary substantially over time, the probability of travel across national borders may have decreased after the initial phase of the epidemic. Finally, we quantify the relative risk of importation of a case into a country from any other currently affected country. The risk of importation is proportional to the population flow into a country from all other countries estimated using a mobility model (here, gravity model) weighted by the infectivity at each country (which depends on the number of cases and time at which they were infected, see Methods). Our estimates of the countries with higher risk of acting as source of importations are largely consistent with the reported source of cases (Fig 5) . In 4 out of the 5 reported cases of international spread of the epidemic in West Africa, the model correctly attributed the highest relative risk of acting as a source of importation (relative risk > 0.9 for importation into Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and 0.49 in case of Mali) to the actual source identified through retrospective epidemiological and genomic investigations [26] .
In the context of increasing potential for movement of diseases between various regions of the world due to increased global connectivity, innovative strategies for epidemic monitoring are urgently needed. In this study, we propose a statistical framework that relies on digital surveillance data from ProMED or HealthMap to 1) predict the short-term epidemic trajectory in currently affected countries, 2) quantify the short-term risk of spread to other countries and 3) for countries at risk of importation, quantify where the risk comes from. We apply our model to data collected during the West African Ebola epidemic of 2013-2016, curated by the outbreak analysts at ProMED/HealthMap, and we compare the model's outputs to those obtained when using the data collated by the WHO and made available at the end of the epidemic.
In spite of the manual curation of the data carried out by outbreak analysts at ProMED and HealthMap, substantial issues remained in the quality and consistency of the data feeds. Dealing with issues such as missing data and inconsistent records will be a key challenge in using these data for prospective real-time analysis. Despite these challenges, we show the potential of digital surveillance tools to 1) inform early detection, 2) characterise the spread, and 3) forecast the future trajectory of outbreaks. Particularly in an evolving outbreak scenario, when information from traditional surveillance is limited and only available with a significant delay, digital surveillance data can be used to complement the information gap. For instance, during the West African Ebola epidemic, the first situation report by the WHO was published only at the end of August 2014 [27] , reporting on cases between January and August 2014. On the other hand, the first post on ProMED on Ebola cases in Guinea appeared in March 2014 [28] . Development of tools that can directly be plugged into the current digital surveillance ecosystem should therefore be a growing area of focus.
In general, we found that, after systematic processing to remove inconsistencies, data from ProMED and HealthMap were in reasonably good agreement with the data collected through traditional surveillance methods and collated by WHO. In particular, both the incidence time-series and retrospective national estimates of transmissibility over time were well correlated across the three data sources. This suggests that digital surveillance data are a promising avenue for quantitative assessment of outbreak dynamics in real-time.
We used the ProMED/HealthMap data to perform a spatio-temporal analysis of the spread of the West African Ebola epidemic. We fitted a spatially explicit branching process model to the daily incidence data derived from ProMED/HealthMap feeds. The estimated model parameters were used to simulate the future outbreak trajectory over 4, 6 or 8 weeks. The model performs relatively well at short forecast horizon, i.e. up to two weeks. At a longer time scale, the model performance starts to deteriorate. A likely explanation for this is that our model assumes that transmissibility remains constant over the entire projection window. This assumption may not hold as we project over longer horizons, for example due to interventions being implemented. Model performance was also highly dependent on the phase of the epidemic in which projections were made. During the growing phase, the model tended to over-predict. This is likely due to interventions implemented throughout the growing phase to reduce transmissibility, leading to a reduced observed incidence compared to our model's expectation. In the declining phase on the other hand, our model tended to under-predict the observed incidence. This could be due to control efforts being relaxed too early as case numbers decline. Another contributing factor could be super-spreading, a phenomenon observed in many epidemics including Ebola epidemics [29, 30] whereby a small number of cases generate a large number of secondary infections, implying that when case numbers are small, epidemic trajectory may be difficult to predict and not well described by Poisson likelihood. Models using more complex likelihoods, e.g. using Negative Binomial distributions, 10 should be explored in future work, but will present additional challenges as analytical results underpinning the estimation of the reproduction number will no longer hold [20] . Such variability in model performance throughout an epidemic could have important implications if the model predictions are used to inform resource allocation. Model estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution, particularly as an outbreak is observed to be declining, and if the forecast horizon is long.
We have shown that our model would have been able to accurately predict in real-time the international spread of Ebola in West Africa. Importantly, our model has very high sensitivity, predicting all instances of observed international spread 1 to 4 weeks in advance. Choosing a cut-off to maximise sensitivity led to low model specificity. On occasions the model predicted cases in countries, such as Côte d'Ivoire, where neither WHO nor ProMED reported any case. However this may also be due to imperfect case reporting. Thus our method could be used with a high cut-off as a highly sensitive surveillance system with an alert triggering further epidemiological investigations and implementation of epidemic preparedness measures.
A key feature of our model is that it provides, for each country identified as at risk, a map of where the risk comes from. Out of 5 observed instances of international spread of Ebola in West Africa, our model correctly identified the source of importation in 4 cases while in the remaining case, the model highlighted the source of importation while assigning it low relative risk. This could help translating data collected through digital surveillance into concrete operational outputs in real-time that could assist in epidemic management and control.
The systematic collection, storage, organization and communication of disease surveillance data were especially challenging during the West African Ebola epidemic as the deficiencies in transportation and communication resources, surveillance data quality and management, human resources and management structures posed unique challenges in this context [31] . The collection of case incidence data and rapid dissemination through digital surveillance systems was further hampered by the limited information technology and internet service in the countries most affected. Thus, for the West African Ebola epidemic, ProMED and HealthMap data were available at a coarse spatial scale with the sub-national level information for cases missing in most of the records. This limited our analysis to the spread of the outbreak across national borders only, although in principle our model could 11 deal with data at any spatial scale. Both ProMED and HealthMap collect more granular data for most outbreaks. Utilizing these data to investigate outbreaks and regions would provide further evidence of the ability of digital surveillance data to usefully complement data collected from traditional surveillance. Another interesting research avenue would be to explore ways of integrating timely data from ProMED and HealthMap with delayed data from ground surveillance to generate timely insights into the spatial spread of an outbreak.
The framework presented in this paper was developed as a proof-ofconcept to use digital surveillance data for near real-time forecasting of the spatio-temporal spread of an outbreak. It has been implemented as a web-based tool called ""Mapping the Risk of International Infectious Disease Spread"" (MRIIDS) (see [32] for more information). To further develop such approaches, it is important to establish an automated pipeline from data collection to curation to analysis, which currently requires manual intervention at each of these steps. Another factor that could enhance the usability of our model in near real time is to improve the running time of the fitting and forward simulation. In the current implementation, the running time varies from approximately 0.5 CPU hours when 100 days of incidence data are being used to approximately 335 CPU hours using 462 days of incidence data using a 3.3 GHz Intel Xeon X5680 processor. Although the West African Ebola epidemic was of unusual scale and duration, there is a scope for optimising the model implementation.
Importantly, many other open data sources could be included in our framework to improve model performance. For example, data on human mobility could be used to further inform the parametric form and parameter values of our mobility model. We have incorporated a simple and wellcharacterised model of population movement in the current work. In addition to utilising other possible data sources, future work could consider other models of human population movement [33] . When relevant, spatially-explicit data on population-level immunity to the circulating pathogen (e.g. following previous epidemics and/or due to vaccination) could also be used to refine our transmission model. Finally, the impact of the health capacity of a region to respond to a public health emergency could also be accounted for in future iterations of the model. Ongoing efforts to collate quantitative information on the performance of health systems and the ability of regions or countries to respond to an epidemic [34], [35] can potentially provide valuable data for future work. Here using a relatively simple modelling approach we provide one of the first pieces of evidence of the potential value of digital surveillance for real-time quantitative analysis of epidemic data, with important operational and actionable outputs.

Processing ProMED/HealthMap data feed
We used a set of curated ProMED and HealthMap records on the human cases of Ebola in West Africa. The dates in the feeds ranged from March 2014 to October 2016. Each dataset recorded the cumulative number of suspected/confirmed cases and suspected/confirmed deaths by country at various dates in this period. We derived the country specific daily and weekly incidence time series from these data after the following data cleaning and pre-processing:
• We first extracted the total case counts as a sum of suspected and confirmed cases (ProMED and HealthMap data did not record probable cases for the West African Ebola epidemic).
• Each unique record in ProMED is associated with a unique alert id. An alert id can correspond to various reports from different sources (news, social media etc.) which might report different case numbers. In such cases, we assigned the median of the case numbers to the record.
• In some instances, cumulative case count was inconsistent in that it failed to be monotonically non-decreasing. We identified consecutive dates (t k and t k+1 ) where the cumulative case count was not increasing. If removing either t k or t k+1 made the cumulative case count increasing,

In forecasting ahead, we assumed transmissibility to be constant over the forecast horizon. If the 97.5 th percentile of the R estimate used for forecasting was less than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in the declining phase during this period. Similarly, if the 2.5 th percentile of R was greater than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in a growing phase. The phase was set to stable where the 95% Credible Interval of the R estimates contained 1. See Methods for definitions of each metric.

The left panel shows the True and False alert rates using different thresholds for classification for alerts raised 1 (violet), 2 (light violet), 3 (dark pink) and 4 (green) weeks ahead. The black curve depicts the overall True and False alert rates. On each curve, the dot shows the True and False Alert rates at 42.5% threshold. For a given threshold (x th percentile of the forecast interval), we defined a True alert for a week where the x th percentile of the forecast interval and the observed incidence for a country were both greater than 0; false alert for a week where the threshold for a country was greater than 0 but the observed incidence for that country was 0; and missed alert for a week where the threshold for a country was 0 but the observed incidence for that country was greater than 0. True alert rate is the ratio of correctly classified true alerts to the total number of true and missed alerts (i.e., (true alerts)/(true alerts + missed alerts)). False alert rate is similarly the ratio of false alerts to the total number of false alerts and weeks of no alert (where the observed and the threshold incidence are both 0). The right panel shows the True (green), False (orange) and Missed (red) 1 week ahead alerts using the 42.5 th percentile of the forecast interval as threshold. The figure only shows countries on the African continent for which either the 42.5 th percentile of the predicted incidence or the observed incidence was greater than 0 at least once. The first alert in each country is shown using larger squares. Alerts in a country in a week where there were no observed cases in the previous week are shown using triangles. In each case, weeks for which all observed points were imputed are shown in lighter shades. Country codes, shown on the yaxis, are as follows: CIV -Côte d'Ivoire, GHA -Ghana, GIN -Guinea, LBR -Liberia, MLI -Mali, NGA -Nigeria, SEN -Senegal, SLE -Sierra Leone, BFA -Burkina Faso. The alerts are based on forecasts using ProMED data, a 2-week calibration window and a 4 week forecast horizon.

For each country with non-zero incidence, the figure shows the relative importation risk (see Methods). Since we forecasted every 7 th day, the risk of importation was estimated using forecasts closest to and before the date of the first case in that country reported in the data used. The date on which risk was estimated for each country is shown in the figure. Blue indicates low relative risk while deeper shades of red represent higher relative risk of acting as a source of importation. White is used to denote no risk. The estimates presented here use ProMED data with a 2 week calibration window. The country for which risk is estimated is shown in gray. The black circle represents the actual source of importation as retrospectively identified through epidemiological and genomic investigations. For each country, the figure shows only the risk of importation from other countries and does not show the risk of transmission within the country.

If however removing both or none of them resulted in a increasing series, we removed both t k and t k+1 . These rules were applied iteratively until the cumulative case count was consistent.
• If an inconsistent point was at the end of the the cumulative case series, applying the above rules led to the removal of a large number of points. Hence, to remove outliers at the end, we used Chebyshev inequality with sample mean [36] . Given a set of observations X 1 , X 2 . . . X n , the formulation of Chebyshev inequality by Saw et al. gives the probability that the observation X n+1 is within given sample standard deviations of the sample mean. We defined X n+1 to be an outlier if the probability of observing this point given observations X 1 , X 2 . . . X n is less than 0.5. Fixing this probability allowed us to determine k such that P r(µ−kσ ≤ X {n + 1} ≤ µ + kσ) ≥ 0.5, where µ and σ are the sample mean and sample standard deviation respectively. We deleted an observation X n+1 as an outlier if it did lie in this interval.
• Finally, cumulative incidence on days with no records was filled in using log-linear interpolation.

We used the West African Ebola incidence data collated by the WHO during the epidemic which was made available approximately an year after the end of the epidemic [37] . This data set is referred to as ""WHO data"" in the interest of brevity. The cleaned version of the WHO data consisted of cases reported between December 2013 and October 2015 in the three most affected countries -Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The location of residence of cases was geo-coded to the second administrative level. We aggregated the WHO data to national level to match the spatial resolution of ProMED and HealthMap that were only available at the country level.
Since the data collected by ProMED and HealthMap are manually curated by outbreak analysts, we have used the word ""curate"" in referring to their data collection process. Similarly, we refer to the data ""collated"" by WHO as WHO coordinated the international response to the outbreak and 19 .

in this role, they collated the information from Ministries of Health, situation reports from NGOs, and local and international medical teams.
We used LandScan TM 2015 dataset grid [38] for population estimates and centroids for all countries on African mainland.
Our model relies on a well-established statistical framework that assumes the daily incidence, I t , can be approximated with a Poisson process following the renewal equation [19] :
Here R t is the reproduction number at time t (the average number of secondary cases per infected individual) and ω is the distribution of the serial interval (the time between onset of symptoms in a case and their infector). We extend this model to incorporate the spatial spread of the outbreak between n different locations. The number of incident cases at a location j at time t is given by the equation
where R t i is the reproduction number at location i at time t and p i→j is the probability of a case moving from location i to location j while they are infectious. R t i is affected by a number of factors e.g., the intrinsic transmissibility of a pathogen or the health care capacity at location i (which could influence for example the capacity to isolate cases). The model could be easily extended to explicitly incorporate the dependence of the reproduction number on such factors.
The probability of moving between locations is derived from the relative flow of populations between locations. This latter quantity can be estimated using a population flow model; here we used a gravity model [39] , [21] . Under a gravity model, the flow of individuals from area i to area j, φ i→j , is proportional to the product of the populations of the two locations, N i and N j and inversely proportional to the distance between them d i,j raised to a power γ:
The exponent γ, which modulates the effect of distance on the flow of populations, was estimated. A large value of γ indicates that the distances travelled by populations tend to be short.
The relative risk of spread at a location j from a location i is thus proportional to the population flow into location j from location i.
The probability of movement from location i to location j where (j = i)is then given by
where p stay is the probability that a case remains in a location i throughout their infectious period i.e. p stay is p i→i . p stay is assumed to be the same across all locations.
The parameters of the full model are:
1. R t i , the reproduction number at time t in location i, 2. p stay , the probability of staying in a location, and 3. γ, the exponent of the distance in the gravity model.
The likelihood of the incidence at time t in location j given past incidence across all locations and model parameters is:

I t i {i=1,2,...n} is similarly the incidence at time t in locations 1, 2, . . . n. Λ t j is given by
The likelihood of the parameters for data up to time T , the duration of the outbreak so far, is
Therefore the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters given the observed data is:
P (p stay ), P (γ), and P R t j t=1,2,...T j=1,2,...n represent the prior distributions on the parameters.
Here, we have assumed a single p stay for all countries on African mainland. For estimating the time-varying reproduction number for each country, we split the duration of the total outbreak into intervals of equal width. We assume that transmissibility in each location stays constant within each time window and thus, within a time window, we estimated a single reproduction number for each location. We varied the length of the time window to obtain different models, with short time windows increasing the number of parameters in the model. To reduce the number of parameters in the model, we divided the 55 countries on African continent into 5 groups and forced each country in a group to have the same reproduction number in each time window. The first three groups correspond of the three mainly affected countries -Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. The countries that shared a border with these three countries were grouped together. These were Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau and Gambia. The rest of the countries were assigned to the fifth group. A comparison of the performance of different models is presented in the Supplementary Material (Fig 32) .

We assumed a Gamma distributed serial interval with mean 14.2 days and standard deviation 9.6 days [18] . For the reproduction number, we used a Gamma prior with mean 3.3 and variance 1.5. This was informed by a review of estimates of the reproduction number for Ebola Zaire in outbreaks preceding the West African Ebola outbreak which reported estimates ranging from 1.4 to 4.7 [40] . The mean prior 3.3 was chosen as the midpoint of this interval, and the variance 1.5, was chosen so the 95% prior probability interval contains the extremes of this interval.
For the gravity model parameters p stay and γ, we chose uninformative uniform priors. Since p stay is a probability, the prior was a uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1]. γ was allowed to vary between 1 and 2 in the results presented in the main text. We performed a sensitivity analysis where γ has a uniform prior between 1 and 10. The results of this analysis are presented in the SI (SI Section 8).
Model fitting was done in a Bayesian framework using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as implemented in the software Stan [41] and its R interface rstan [42] . We ran 2 MCMC chains with 3000 iterations and burn-in of 1000 iterations. Convergence of MCMC chains was confirmed using visual inspections of the diagnostics (Potential Scale Reduction Factor [43] and Geweke Diagnostics [44]) reported by R package ggmcmc [45] . An example report produced by ggmcmc is included in the Supplementary Material.
For each model (i.e., for each choice of the time window), we made forward projections every 7 th day, over a 2 week, 4 week and 6 week horizon. To forecast incidence from day t onwards, we fitted the model to the daily incidence series up to day t − 1. We then sampled 1000 parameter sets (reproduction numbers for each location in each time window and parameters of the gravity model) from the joint posterior distribution, and for each parameter set, simulated one future epidemic trajectory according to equation (1) , assuming that future R t is equal to the last estimated R t value in each location.
Given the retrospective nature of our analysis, we validated the incidence projected using our model against observed incidence. In addition to the accuracy of the forecasted incidence, the uncertainty associated with the forecasts (e.g., measured by the width of the prediction interval) is an im-23 .

A narrow prediction interval that contains the observed values is preferable over wide prediction intervals. To assess the performance of the model along both these dimensions, we used four different metrics drawn from the literature.
In the remainder of this paper, we use the following notation. For a location j, let I t j be the observed incidence at time t and letÎ t j be the set of predictions of the model at time t. That is,
The relative mean absolute error (rmae) is a widely used measure of model accuracy [46] . The relative mean absolute error for the forecasts at a location j at time t is defined as:
.
That is the mean absolute error at time t is averaged across all simulated incidence trajectories and normalised by the observed incidence. We add 1 to the observed value to prevent division by 0. A rmae value of k means that the average error is k times the observed value.
Sharpness is a measure of the spread (or uncertainty) of the forecasts. Adapting the definition proposed by [47], we used the relative mean deviation about the median to evaluate sharpness. The sharpness s t j of forecasts at at time t at location j is
We add 1 toÎ t j to prevent division by 0. A sharpness score of k indicates that the average deviation of the predicted incidence trajectories is k times their median. Low values of sharpness therefore suggest that the predicted trajectories are clustered around the median.

The bias of forecasts is a measure of the tendency of a model to systematically under-or over-predict [47] . The bias of a set of predictionsÎ t j at time t at location j is defined as
where the mean is taken across the N draws. H(x) is the Heaviside step function defined as
The above formulation can better be understood by considering the following extreme scenarios. If every projected valueÎ t j is greater than the observed value I t j , then the Heaviside function is 1 for all i = 1, 2, . . . N , and
The bias for a model that always over-predicts is therefore 1. On the other hand, if the model systematically under-predicts, then mean H Î t j − I t j is 0 and the bias is -1. For a model for which all predictions match the observed values exactly, the bias is 0.
We defined the epidemic to be in a ""growing"" phase at time t if the 2.5 th percentile of the distribution of the reproduction number at this time was greater than 1. Similarly, the epidemic was defined to be in ""declining"" phase if the 97.5 th percentile of the distribution of the reproduction number was below 1. In all other cases, the epidemic was defined to be in a ""stable"" phase.

The total infectivity Λ t j at a location j at time t is the sum of infectivity at all locations weighted by the relative flow of cases into j from each location i (Eq 2). We define the risk of importation of case from i into j as the proportion of infectivity at j due to infectivity at i. That is,

In this supplement, we present the details of the pre-processing of ProMED and HealthMap feeds (Section 1), the model results using ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data and the impact of the datasources and model parameters on the performance of the model. We varied the length of the time window used for model fitting (see Methods for details). SI Sections 2, SI Section 3 and SI Section 4 present the forecasts using ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data respectively using different calibration windows (2, 4 and 6 weeks) and forecast horizons (4, 6 and 8 weeks). The model performance was moderately better with shorter calibration windows ( Fig 32) and with WHO data (Fig 33) . We explored the impact of alternate priors for the gravity model parameter on the results from the model. The results of this sensitivity analysis are presented in Section 8. We present additional analysis on the predicting the spatial spread of the epidemic in Section 9.
1 Processing ProMED and HealthMap data
The data from ProMED and HealthMap was pre-processed to remove inconsistencies and address missing data (see Methods). The data on cumulative number of confirmed and suspected Ebola cases in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Mali, Nigeria and Ghana were extracted from ProMED and HealthMap feeds.

If there were outliers in the data, we removed them in the next step (d). We then made the cumulative case count monotonically increasing (e) by removing inconsistent records.

The y-axis differs for each plot.
The correlation between estimates of time-varying reproduction number estimated using ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data depended on the time window used for estimation and the country (Fig 3) . Restricting the analysis was robust to using reproduction number estimates with lower uncertainty (coefficient of variation less than 0.25, Fig 4) Similarly, for each data source, 6 . CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Only estimates with a coefficient of variation less than 0.25 were included in this analysis. The reproduction numbers were estimated using R package EpiEstim over a 4 week sliding window. Median estimates from WHO data are on the x-axis and the median estimates using ProMED (blue) and HealthMap (green) data are on the y-axis. All correlation coefficients were statistically significant.

In forecasting ahead, we assumed transmissibility to be constant over the forecast horizon. If the 97.5th percentile of the R estimate used for forecasting was less than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in the declining phase during this period. Similarly, if the 2.5th percentile of R was greater than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in a growing phase. The phase was set to stable where the 95% Credible Interval of the R estimates contained 1.

The parameter γ thus modulates the influence of distance on the population flow. p stay represents the probability of an individual to stay in a given location during their infectious period. The solid lines represents the median estimates obtained using WHO (yellow), ProMED (blue) and HealthMap (green) data. The shaded regions represent the 95% CrI.
For the results presented in the main text, we choose an uninformative uniform prior for the parameter γ with an upper bound 2. We also fitted the model with a uniform prior for γ allowing it to vary from 1 to 10. In this section we present the results from the sensitivity analyses. Fig 34 presents the 63 .

As the epidemic progressed, the parameter p stay assumed larger values suggesting a decreased probability of travel over time (Figures 34, 35) . As p stay assumes large values, the estimated flow is more strongly influenced by p stay than by γ. Furthermore, p stay is likely to depend on the spatial scale of the model. Our analyses were carried out at the national scale; we expect that γ will be more sensitive to p stay at a finer spatial resolution. Overall, the flow between locations using the parameters estimated using the two alternative priors did not vary much (Fig 36) . Figures 37 to 45 present the model forecasts using the alternative priors for γ and Figure 46 presents a comparison of model performance metrics using the two priors. Although the analysis was carried out for the three data sources (ProMED, HealthMap and WHO), for brevity we present results using ProMED data only. Here γ is allowed to vary between 1 and 10. p stay represents the probability of an individual to stay in a given location during their infectious period. The solid lines represents the median estimates obtained using ProMED (blue), HealthMap (green) and WHO (yellow) data. The shaded regions represent the 95% CrI.

In this section, we present additional analyses carried out on predicting the spatial spread of the epidemic. Classification of alerts raised 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks ahead are shown in Fig 47. We also assessed the sensitivity of the model when the analysis was restricted to countries other than Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (Fig 48) . At 93% threshold, the model exhibited high specificity (83.3%) and sensitivity (82.0%) in predicting presence of cases in weeks following a week with no observed cases in each country (Fig 49) . In predicting presence of cases in countries with no or low incidence, or in a week following a week in which no cases were observed, the sensitivity improved at higher thresholds with a reasonably low false alert rate (Fig 50) . Finally, we find that the model is able to attain a high sensitivity and specificity relatively early in the epidemic using all three data sources (Fig 51) . Since WHO data used here were only available for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we affixed data from ProMED for all countries other than these three to WHO data for the purpose of classifying alerts.
For a given threshold (x th percentile of the forecast interval), we defined a True alert for a week where the x th percentile of the forecast interval and the observed incidence for a country were both greater than 0; false alert for a week where the threshold for a country was greater than 0 but the observed incidence for that country was 0; and missed alert for a week where the threshold for a country was 0 but the observed incidence for that country was greater than 0. True alert rate is the ratio of correctly classified true alerts to the total number of true and missed alerts (i.e., (true alerts)/(true alerts + missed alerts)). False alert rate is similarly the ratio of false alerts to the total number of false alerts and weeks of no alert (where the observed and the threshold incidence are both 0).

107f0d5a47f48f85d6645cac0e7008edc4d9d8cd,"Public health concerns about recent viral epidemics have motivated researchers to seek transdisciplinary understanding of infection in wildlife hosts. With its deep history devoted to explaining the abundance and distribution of organisms, ecology can augment current methods for studying viral dynamics. However, datasets allowing ecological explorations of viral communities are lacking, and common methods for delineating viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs), or ""species"", are subjective. Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes. This work is the first exploration of viral community ecology in a community of wildlife hosts. Lipkin WI (2013) A strategy to estimate unknown viral diversity in mammals. mBio 4: e00598-13.","Public health concerns associated with recent and ongoing outbreaks of viruses (e.g., Ebola virus and Zika virus) have motivated researchers to investigate viral diversity in wildlife hosts from previously unexplored perspectives. Ecology has a long history of quantifying the abundance and distribution of organisms and has been increasingly integrated into viral studies (Anthony et al. 2015 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . Traditionally, such efforts have focused on isolated cases of single host-single pathogen relationships (Telfer et al. 2010) . However, infected host individuals generally have multiple pathogens, and infection with one pathogen can affect infection, virulence, or disease emergence of the others (Pedersen and Fenton 2006 , Jolles et al. 2008 , Telfer et al. 2010 , Seabloom et al. 2015 . This suggests that perspectives and approaches from community ecology can complement current methods in virology.
Three major challenges exist when integrating community ecology and virology. First, most viruses are rare (i.e. exist at low prevalence; Tang et al. 2006 , Winker et al. 2008 , Wacharapluesadee et al. 2010 , Anthony et al. 2015 , so the probability of infection in a host individual is low. Consequently, large datasets of comprehensively sampled host populations are needed to address high levels of uncertainty associated with low viral prevalence. Few such datasets exist. Second, most wildlife viruses are unknown to science (Anthony et al. 2013 , Anthony et al. 2017 , Carlson et al. 2019 , and the process of defining viral species is timeconsuming (King et al 2012) . This means that waiting for official designations of viral species for use in community-level analyses does not address the urgency of current health challenges posed by wildlife viruses. Alternatives to official designation of viral species include delineating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using monophyletic groups (Anthony et al 2015) or percent identity histograms (Maes et al. 2009 , Anthony et al. 2017 ). However, both such methods rely on subjectively chosen cutoff points to differentiate OTUs. Finally, many viral infections last only hours to days, making detection difficult (Klenk et al. 2004, Lee et al. 2009, Henaux and Samuel Herpesviruses are large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect all vertebrate classes and mollusks (King et al. 2012 , Azab et al. 2018 . In contrast to many viruses, herpesviruses generally occur at high prevalence (Cone et al. 1993 , Kidd et al. 1996 , Cortez et al. 2008 , Imbronito et al. 2008 , Tenorio de Franca et al. 2012 , Phalen et al. 2017 , Tazikeh et al. 2019 , and they establish latent, long-term (often for the entirety of the host's life)
infections (King et al. 2012) . Using herpesviruses as the subject of ecological analyses can therefore minimize two challenges that stymie advancements in viral ecology.
Herpesviruses were first detected in bats in 1996 (Tandler 1996) . Subsequent work shows that bats likely played a critical role in the evolution and diversification of herpesviruses (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2016) . Bats generally have a negative reputation as carriers of deadly viruses that cause human diseases such as rabies, Nipah, and SARS (Wibbelt et al. 2010) , and consequently, most research on bat viruses has focused on these pathogens of concern for public health. Although a number of studies have also detected herpesviruses in bats (Wibbelt et al. 2007 , Razafindratsimandresy et al. 2009 , Zhang et al. 2012 , Sasaki et al. 2014 , Pozo et al. 2016 , Zheng et al. 2016 , Holz et al. 2018 , Wada et al. 2018 , little is known about viral shedding, host specificity, or the diversity of herpesviruses in bats (Zheng et al. 2016) .
Herpesviruses are generally considered to be host-specific (King et al. 2012 ). However, inter-host transmission has been documented when close contact occurs between individuals of different species, especially when host species are closely related (e.g. within primates : Weigler 1992; within turtles: Greenblatt et al. 2005; within ungulates: Russell et al. 2009 ). Multiple bat species come into close proximity within caves where they roost, presenting an opportunity for cross-species viral dispersal. Indeed, cross-species transmission and host switching are common, and have likely been the norm throughout the evolutionary history of the herpesvirus lineage, especially in bat hosts (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2016 , Zheng et al. 2016 , Azab et al. 2018 , Wada et al. 2018 ).
The first goal of this research was to intensively sample bat communities in two Puerto Rican caves, with the intent of saturating viral discovery of herpesviruses for use in ecological analyses. The second goal was to determine a quantitative technique to differentiate operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of herpesviruses as a fast, objective alternative to defining viral species.
Finally, we aimed to describe patterns of host preference for herpesviruses. Given recent advancements in the understanding of host sharing throughout the history of the herpesvirus lineage, we hypothesized that particular OTUs would occur in multiple bat species but would have significantly higher prevalence in one of the species (i.e. viruses will have a core host species; Bush and Holmes 1986); in all satellite (i.e. ""secondary"") hosts combined, viruses will have lower prevalence. sampled from Larva Cave on seven instances between June and August 2017, using two different techniques. After sunset, mist nets were placed along a trail outside of the cave entrance to catch exiting bats and were checked at least every ten minutes. Hand nets were also used to capture bats roosting inside the cave.
Regardless of sampling method, each captured bat was placed into a porous cotton holding bag. Individuals were identified to species following Gannon et al. (2005) , and a clean cotton-tipped swab was used to collect saliva from the bat's mouth. Swabs were placed in individual cryovials containing viral transport medium and sent to Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity, in a dry shipper, and stored at -80°C. All methods were approved by the University of Connecticut Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol A15-032).
Viral Screening: Total nucleic acids were extracted from each swab using the EasyMag platform (bioMerieux, Inc.), and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis supermix (Invitrogen). Nested consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) was performed twice on each sample, targeting a region of the highly conserved catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase gene (Van deVanter et al. 1996) . cPCR is a broadly reactive method that allows detection of novel viruses by using nonspecific primers targeted at viral families or genera (Anthony et al. 2013 (Anthony et al. , 2015 . A constructed synthetic plasmid was used as a positive control to confirm effective implementation of the assay and to detect possible contamination.
PCR gel products (1% agarose) of expected size were cloned into Strataclone PCR cloning vector, and twelve colonies were sequenced to confirm identity and detection of co-occurring viruses. Each clone was cross-referenced using the GenBank nucleotide database to confirm that sequences were indeed herpesviruses. Sequence data will be available at github.com/ARSjodin upon publication.
OTU Delineation: A nucleotide alignment of 3,131 herpesvirus clones was conducted using the ClustalW alignment in Geneious version 11.0.5, and a pairwise percent identity (PID) matrix was calculated based on percent similarity of nucleotides in each sequence pair. A PID histogram was then generated (Maes et al. 2009 ). To evaluate the robustness of cutoffs to errors in alignment, the R package Biostrings (Pages et al. 2017 ) was used to conduct pairwise alignments of clones. A second PID histogram was generated, and frequency clusters were compared between the two PIDs. The number of OTUs was estimated using the cutoff extremes for each level of classification, based on total alignment and pairwise alignment (74, 81, 90 and 93 PID cutoffs, see Results and Figure 1 ).
To statistically support which OTU cutoff to use in subsequent analyses, the R package apcluster (Bodenhofer et al. 2011 ) was used to perform affinity propagation on the PID matrix of the total clone alignment. Affinity propagation is an algorithm that examines all data points in a similarity matrix to identify exemplars (Frey and Dueck 2007). The algorithm then clusters remaining data around an optimum number of exemplars by iteratively exchanging two types of ""messages"" between data points. In the context of viral sequences, the first type of message accumulates evidence for sequence k as an exemplar for sequence i, based on genetic distance between k and i (Frey and Dueck 2007). The second type of message reflects how many sequences besides i support k as the best choice of exemplar (Frey and Dueck 2007).
When inputting the PID matrix of all clones, the number of clusters identified through affinity propagation can be interpreted as an optimal number of viral OTUs. Although this method has been used to define clusters of a single viral species (Fischer et al. 2017) , this is the first instance in which it has been used to delineate viral ""species"" for the purpose of communitylevel analyses. To conduct affinity propagation analyses, the apcluster() command was run using the R package apcluster (Bodenhofer et al. 2011) , with default values of input parameters (input data = NA, input preference = NA, q = 0.5, convits = 100, maxits = 1000, lam = 0.9).
Finally, OTUs were refined manually based on PID and affinity (see Results).
Finally, sequences representing the polymerase gene of formally described beta-and gammaherpesvirus species, as defined by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It Matrices comparing PID of defined viral species were calculated for comparison to empirical values. For ease of exposition, ""species"" will be used moving forward to reference host taxa or formally described viral taxa, whereas ""OTU"" will be used to reference empirical viral taxa.
To determine how well the collected samples represent the metacommunity of herpesviruses infecting bats at Mata de Plátano Nature Reserve, viral discovery curves were created using the iNEXT package in R (Hsieh et al. 2016) . By defining the metacommunity as all of the herpesviruses infecting all of the host species at Mata de Plátano Nature Reserve, an assumption is made that herpesviruses are shared between caves and among host species (i.e. no host specificity). Because this may not be a valid assumption, separate curves were generated for each bat species, as well as for each cave. Additionally, Chao2 estimates (Chao 1987) were calculated for the viral metacommunities of all bats at Mata de Plátano Nature Reserve, as well as for each cave and for each bat species separately.
Host Preference: For each OTU that infected more than one host species, the host specificity index S TD * was calculated (Poulin and Mouillot 2005) as
where i and j represent index values of host species, p represents OTU prevalence within host populations, and w ij is the phylogenetic distinctiveness of hosts. To measure phylogenetic distinctness, hosts of the same genus are assigned a value of one, hosts of the same family but different genera are assigned a value of two, and hosts of different families have a value of three (Poulin and Mouillot 2005). S TD * thus weighs host preference by the relatedness of hosts (incorporating evolution) and the prevalence of the pathogen in each of its hosts (incorporating ecology). The extent of viral sharing among hosts species was further examined by determining whether particular OTUs had a core host species. A core host species was defined as a single host species for which the OTU had significantly higher prevalence than in all other host species .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/856518 doi: bioRxiv preprint combined. To do this, the prevalence of each OTU in its core host and its combined prevalence in all other hosts were compared using Fisher's exact test (Wassertheil-Smoller and Smoller 2015) . For each OTU that infected more than one host individual, viral preference for host sex was examined by comparing OTU prevalence between male and females of the core host species, using Fisher's exact test. All analyses were done using R version 3.4.3, and code used for all methods can be found at github.com/ARSjodin. OTU Delineation: Both alignment techniques resulted in two similar, clearly differentiated potential cutoff ranges, as demonstrated by consistent peaks in the histograms (Figure 1 ). The lower level of taxonomic grouping of OTUs was defined as those with a cutoff between 90 -92%. This means that two sequences with less than 90% genetic similarity would be considered to be different OTUs. The higher level of taxonomic grouping was defined as those with a cutoff between 74 and 80%. As such, two sequences with less than 74% genetic similarity would be considered to be different OTUs. The number of OTUs resulting from the cutoff extremes for both levels of classification, when total alignment and pairwise alignment were considered (74, 81, 90 and 93 PID cutoffs; Figure 1 ), were 29, 31, 42, and 47 OTUs, respectively.
. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/856518 doi: bioRxiv preprint Affinity propagation resulted in 45 OTUs. Although OTU richness did not equal any values generated using the PID histograms, 45 OTUs is within the range of OTUs generated using the lower-level taxonomic cutoff (i.e. 42 -47 OTUs at 90 -93% PID cutoff), suggesting this cutoff is more strongly supported by affinity propagation than is the higher-level cutoff.
Additionally, no two described herpesvirus species were greater than 90% similar. However, Ateline herpesvirus 3 and Saimirine herpesvirus 2, two gammaherpesvirus species, and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 5 and Macacine herpesvirus 3, two betaherpesvirus species, differed by 83.6% and 78.5%, respectively. Additionally, two strains of Human herpesvirus 6, a betaherpesvirus, and Human herpesvirus 4, a gammaherpesvirus, differed by 96.2 and 99.1%, respectively. These PIDs of established viral species further support the use of the lower-level taxonomic cutoff.
To refine the exact number of OTUs, two neighbor-joining trees were generated from the exemplar sequences, as determined using affinity propagation, one for the gammaherpesviruses and one for the betaherpesviruses. (Figure 2 ). When exemplar sequences were greater than 90% similar (the most conservative cutoff within the lower taxonomic range), clusters were merged to represent a single OTU. Additionally, each OTU represented by a single occurrence (i.e. a single clone sequence) was examined individually. If the singleton sequence was greater than 74% similar to the exemplar of another OTU, the least conservative cutoff point demonstrated by PID histograms, it was clustered with that OTU. Singleton sequences less than or equal to 74% similar to each of the other exemplars were considered to be unique OTUs. After refinement, 41 OTUs remained. Preliminary data collected The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/856518 doi: bioRxiv preprint
No OTU existed at a prevalence greater than 6.2% in the entire host community (i.e. across all host species). When viral metacommunities were examined at the level of host population (i.e. in a single species), however, OTU prevalence reached a peak of 26.3% (OTU 17 in A. jamaicensis; Table 2 ). At the population-level, four OTUs reached a prevalence greater than 20%, and 29 OTUs existed at prevalence values between 1% and 10%. Five OTUs existed at a prevalence less than 1% in all of their host populations. OTU richness per host population ranged from three to 15. In comparison, humans are the only host species for which comprehensive data are available on total herpesvirus richness, and only eight known herpesvirus species infect humans, despite their cosmopolitan distribution.
The Chao2 estimate of herpesvirus richness in the bats of both caves was 51.1 OTUs (Table 1 ). As such, the detected OTUs (N = 41) represent about 80% of those in the entire herpesvirus metacommunity (Figure 3 ). Viral discovery curves were more saturated in Culebrones (85%) than in Larva (61%) Cave, and host species-level saturation ranged from 55% (P. quadridens) to 93% (B. cavernarum) (Table 1; Figure 3) . A viral discovery curve was not generated for the herpesvirus metacommunity infecting P. portoricensis, as only three OTUs were detected.
Host Preference: Thirteen OTUs were detected in one or more host species (Table 3) . S TD * for each of these OTUs ranged from one (infecting two hosts from the same genus) to three (infecting three hosts of two families). Nine OTUs had significantly higher prevalence in a core host species than in all other host species combined (Table 4 ). Only two OTUs showed significantly higher prevalence in one host sex than in the other (Table 5) . OTU 1 infected a significantly higher percentage of male than female P. quadridens (p = 0.021), and OTU 21 infected a significantly higher percentage of female than male Mon. redmani (p = 0.023).
Our extensive quantification of viral infection in bats represents the first comprehensive study of the virome of a wildlife host community and suggests that Puerto Rican bats offer a .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/856518 doi: bioRxiv preprint previously untapped resource for advancing the field of viral ecology. Even in the absence of full genome sequences, viral OTUs can be robustly differentiated and used to understand the natural history and host specificity of viruses.
The application of tools and perspectives from community ecology to better understand viral infection dynamics necessitates an objective, quantitatively-supported delineation of viral ""species"". Officially designating novel viral species requires substantial data, oftentimes full genome sequences, and approval by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses ), but has never been used to identify viral OTUs for analyses in the context of community ecology. Here, we show that affinity propagation can be used as a quantitative complement, in congruence with currently defined herpesvirus species, to objectively support current methods of viral OTU delineation.
A limit to working with viruses in an ecological context is the short viral lifespan or activation cycle (e.g. lytic stage), as compared to that in free-living or macroparasitic organisms.
Short lifespans affect temporal turnover of detected OTUs and could influence interpretation of results. Although it is common for some viral infections to last only hours or days, the lytic cycle of herpesvirus infections is typically longer than that of most other viruses (King et al. 2012 ).
This represents an advantage in the use of herpesviruses for preliminary exploration of viral ecology, as the duration during which OTUs can be detected will be greater than that of other .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/856518 doi: bioRxiv preprint taxa. Indeed, all OTUs detected during preliminary sampling in 2016 (i.e. OTUs 12, 17, and 25) were detected again in 2017, in the same core host species (Table 2) .
Another advantage to studying herpesviruses from an ecological context is that this viral family often exists at high prevalence levels (Cone et al. 1993 , Kidd et al. 1996 , Cortez et al. 2008 , Imbronito et al. 2008 , Tenorio de Franca et al. 2012 , Phalen et al. 2017 , Tazikeh et al. 2019 . While some surveys (e.g. Cone et al. 1993 , Kidd et al. 1996 , Phalen et al. 2017 show Generally, herpesviruses are highly host specific, but when host-virus relationships are examined at an evolutionary timescale, host switching has been the norm (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2016 , Azab et al. 2018 . As such, we expected herpesviruses that infected multiple host species to have core hosts. Overall, we found evidence of host sharing among bat species at Mata de Plátano Nature Reserve, regardless of cave. The existence of host sharing is further supported by viral prevalence and viral discovery curves. A higher prevalence at the populationlevel (i.e. a single species) than the community-level, as seen here (Table 2) , is consistent with host-specificity. Also, at the largest scale (i.e. the entire nature reserve), sampling completeness reached 80%. This is in contrast to accumulation curves for viral metacommunities infecting particular host populations, which were as low as 55% (P. quadridens). This suggests that undiscovered OTUs at the scale of host population have already been discovered at the scale of nature reserve (i.e. have already been discovered in another host species). This supports the hypothesis that certain OTUs that are common in a core host are rare in all other host species.
Indeed, nine of the 13 multi-host OTUs had significantly higher prevalence in a single host than in all other hosts in which it occurred combined ( Table 3 ). Those that did not have significantly different prevalence were rare OTUs in all infected hosts (OTU 7, OTU 15, OTU 26), or were .

In conclusion, ecological tools and perspectives can be used to understand viral infection and transmission, generating a multitude of hypotheses in the emerging field of viral ecology. Future studies with goals of monitoring public health should increase the number of sampled individuals for each host species to enhance the likelihood of uncovering patterns of host preference and reservoir status. Studies aimed at viral ecology will likely require focus on more prevalent viral taxa, such as herpesviruses, instead of rare viral taxa of more zoonotic concern, such as coronaviruses or filoviruses. Further ecological research should prioritize sampling host individuals from multiple field locations, addressing viral infection and transmission at multiple spatial scales, while decoupling the spatial and ecological mechanisms that shape viral community assembly.

We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including 30 Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-31 BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5 and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested 32 their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). 33 Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible 34 to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed 35 different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines 36 respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot 37 replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to 38 those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical 39 residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 40 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA 41 expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P=0.0174), supporting that DPP4 42 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus 43 DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular 44 factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should 45 prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin. 46 47 All rights reserved.

Existing evidence suggests that MERS-CoV may be originated from bats. In particular, 49
Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 spike protein was shown to utilize MERS-CoV receptor, human 50 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To better understand the potential infectivities of MERS-CoV in 51 bats, we developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris 52 pachypus and Rhinolophus sinicus (host of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 and SARS-related-53
CoV respectively). MERS-CoV demonstrated much broader cellular tropism than SARS-CoV 54 and HCoV-229E, being able to infect five cell lines, including R. sinicus but not T. pachypus 55 cells. The close phylogenetic relationship between bat and human DPP4 genes supported the 56 ability of MERS-CoV to infect bat cells, while DPP4 expression appeared critical for MERS-57
CoV replication. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV 58 susceptibility in T. pachypus cells.

The sequence of M. pusillus was not determined, as RT-PCR for the DPP4 mRNA 155 from bat cells was negative. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the bat DPP4 mRNA sequences 156 formed a distinct cluster being closely related to sequences from human and non-human MERS-CoV spike protein (64, 65). Upon multiple sequence alignment of the corresponding 160 regions that contain these critical residues, most of the residues are conserved in the six bat 161 DPP4 sequences in this study (Fig. 3B) The broader cellular tropism of MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E in bat 206 cells may reflect the host diversity of lineage C betacoronaviruses in bats.

SARSr-CoVs in bats were shown to 210 utilize the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), for cell 211 entry (67). Similar to SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E is likely to have originated from bats. CoVs 212 closely related to HCoV-229E have been detected in bats of the genus Hipposideros in Africa 213 (68). More recently, CoVs even closer to HCoV-229E were identified in dromedary camels in 214 the Middle East, which were able to utilize the receptor of HCoV-229E, human aminopeptidase 215 N (hAPN) for cell entry (69). This suggests that dromedary camels may have served as 216 intermediate hosts for bat-to-human transmission of HCoV-229E, which may be analogous to 217 the evolution of MERS-CoV. Recently, a CoV, closely related to HCoV-NL63 in most genome 218 regions except the spike protein, was detected from a bat of the genus Triaenops in Kenya (70). 219 However, further studies are required to identify even closer relatives of HCoV-NL63 to 220 ascertain its possible bat origin. In contrast to SARSr-CoVs and HCoV-229E which were 221 mainly found in horseshoe and roundleaf bats respectively, a more diverse host range was 222 observed in lineage C betacoronaviruses. Yet, the different bat species harboring lineage C 223 betacoronaviruses all belonged to the family Vespertilionidae. Specifically, Ty-BatCoV HKU4, 224 including cells from Hipposideros. This may suggest a relatively narrow host range of SARS-231
CoV and HCoV-229E in bats compared to lineage C betacoronaviruses including The close phylogenetic relationship between bat and primate DPP4 sequences may 233 reflect the replicative ability of MERS-CoV in bat cells. Moreover, cells that supported MERS-234
CoV replication showed significantly higher DPP4 mRNA expression than those that were non-235 susceptible to MERS-CoV, suggesting that cellular DPP4 expression is critical for viral 236 infection.

Active transport and facilitated 44 diffusion are dependent on the specific molecular binding between cargo and transporter, 45 thereby exhibiting stereospecificity, transport saturation, and competitive inhibition 46 (Cirillo, 1961) . Moreover, numerous sugars are taken up with concomitant 47 phosphorylation via the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): carbohydrate phosphotransferase 48 system (PTS), which may cause carbon catabolite repression (CCR), leading to a diauxic 49 cell growth (Stülke & Hillen, 1999) .

In bacteria, this channel is 60 formed by the SecY complex (SecYEG) and is located in the plasma membrane 61 (Brundage et al, 1990; Akimaru et al, 1991; Breyton et al, 2002) . The X-ray crystal 62 structure revealed that the SecY channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow central 63 constriction consisting of six hydrophobic amino acid residues termed the pore ring, and (Kornberg et al, 2000) , these 74 findings prompted us to hypothesize that whether the SecY channel can be designed as a 75 free diffusion passageway for efficient transport of carbohydrates, thus developing an 76 entirely novel paradigm for sugar passage and addressing the problems encountered with 77 the specific transporters.

When we expressed the SecY with deletion of the plug (SecY (ΔP)) in an E. coli 89 (ΔPtsG) lacking the glucose PTS (Plumbridge, 1998) (Fig 2A and B) , the cell growth 90 defect was not observed (Fig 2D and E) . In contrast, the limited growth on glucose 91 caused by insufficient import of the sole carbon source was partially rescued. We 92 reasoned that the SecY (ΔP) channel might allow glucose to diffuse through the plasma 93 membrane due to its small V A (≈ 0.178 m 3 /kmol) and large diffusion coefficient (D AB ≈ 94 1.009×10 -9 m 2 /s) in water (Appendix Table S1 ), which was confirmed by a [ 14 C]-labelled 95 glucose transport assay (Fig 2C) . With the purpose of further enhancing the glucose 96 uptake, SCVE was co-expressed with the SecY (ΔP) channel (Fig 2A and B) . The SCVE 97 has the ability to permeabilize the outer membrane of E. coli by formation of the 98 transmembrane pores as porins (Liao et al, 2004) .

111b9a6e91c938696fcdb4cb128b8ae739dbe11c,"Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42·9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.",". In addition, SARS-CoV was detected in urine, feces and tears of some SARS-CoV infected patients. It was confirmed that SARS-CoV could be transmitted through fecal-oral and contiguous pathways 6, 8 . Thus far, there has not been a report to show if SARS-CoV can be transmitted through sexual transmission. Therefore, based on the transmission route of SARS-CoV, current preventive measures, including maintaining good personal and environmental health, and implementing strict contact and droplet prevention measures in the community, can effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV 6 . However, different from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, another virus of the same coronavirus family, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread to several other countries 9,10 , was transmitted through large droplets and close contact, although the possibility of air transmission or dust mite transmission was not ruled out 9 . Also, it is not clear whether MERS-CoV is sexually transmitted. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided recommendations for the prevention of MERS-CoV, mainly including droplet and contact precautions 11 . Interestingly, HCoV-229E in the coronavirus family was detected in the maternal vagina and also found in the gastric swab samples of newborns 12 . This makes the sexual transmission of this type of virus possible although there is no direct evidence to prove it. Therefore, it also remains possible that SARS-CoV-2, as a new type of coronavirus, could be sexually transmitted.
Currently, the main known transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory air droplets. The other routes could be through secretary liquids, such as from eyes 13, 14 . SARS-CoV-2 was shown to exist in the feces of patients with COVID-19, suggesting that fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible 15 . Although there is currently no evidence for vertical transmission 16 
The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) and outcome data were obtained from patients' records. To ascertain the authenticity and integrity of the gynecologic history, especially the sexual behavior history, we also directly communicated with patients or their families.
All information was obtained and curated with a standardized data collection form.
Two researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data. Sample collection, processing, and laboratory testing complied with WHO guidance.
Positive confirmatory cases of COVID-19 infection were defined as those with a positive test result from either laboratory.
SPSS software, version 20·0, was used for statistical analysis. The continuous measurements were presented as mean (SD) if they were normally distributed or median (IQR) if they were not, and categorical variables as count (%). For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the measurements were outside the normal range.

35 patients with COVID-19 were recruited in this study, the range of their age was 37-88, with a mean age of 61·5 years (SD =11·2; Table 1 ). Most patients were natives of Wuhan (n =29, 82.9%), and only one had directly contacted with Huanan seafood market. The most common chronic medical diseases were hypertension (n =12, 34.3%) and diabetes (n =7, 20%). As for gynecological diseases, uterine fibroids were mentioned the most (n =13, 37·1%). Other diseases included cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III, endometrial atypical hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer, with one patient for each disease. Most patients had entered menopause (n =28, 80%). For the rest 7 patients, except for 1 puerperal woman who had a cesarean section 2 days before with breast milk and neonatal throat swab SARS-CoV-2 negative, the remaining 6 patients still had menstruation, in which half of them complained of decreased menstrual flow.

The remaining 8 patients were clinically diagnosed depend on the images of CT scan (Table2). All patients in this study were classified at admission, including mild group (n =1, 2·9%), severe group (n =32, 91·4%) and critical group (n =2, 5·7%, Table 2 ). After admission, the white blood cell count was decreased in 5 (14·3%) patients and increased in 4 patients (11·4%, Table 3 ). 16 (45·7%) patients had a lymphocyte count reduction, while 18 patients (51.4%) had a lymphocyte ratio below the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level was increased in 14 (40%) patients. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate accelerated in 19 (54·3%) patients. 10 (28.6%) patients had increased aspartate transaminase (AST), and 13 (37·1%) patients had elevated alanine transaminase (ALT). The serum potassium was decreased in 5 patients (14·3%) and increased in 3 patients (8·6%). All rights reserved.

IL-2R, IL-6, and TNF-α were higher than the normal range in half or more patients, respectively. Notably, 9 (32·1%) patients' level of IL-2R, IL-6, and TNF-α increased altogether. Every patient showed typical findings of chest CT images-multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in lungs. Typical images from each group were demonstrated ( Figure 1 ).
Most patients received antiviral and antibiotic treatment (n =33, 94·3% and n =29, 82·9% respectively), 13 (37·1%) patients received glucocorticoids ( Table 2 ). 9
(25·7%) patients received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Three (8·6%) patients received anticoagulant therapy. Oxygen therapy was used for every patient.
Most of the patients received oxygen by mask or nasal catheter. Only 2 (5·7%) patients received non-invasive ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and they were free of BiPAP on the day we collected the samples. No patient received Invasive ventilation ( Table 2 ). By the end of Feb 22, 1 (2·9%) patient had been discharged, and all other patients were still in the hospital ( Table 1) .
The infection rate for the 35 female patents' sexual partner was up to 42·9%, but only 2 patients, Patient 14 and 19, admitted having sexual behavior with their partners from 14 days before the onset of first symptoms to the day we collected samples (Table 1, Table 4 , Figure 2 ). The detailed timelines are exhibited ( Figure 2 ). Both patients use intrauterine device for contraception. Patient 14 was 48 years old. She had regular sex behavior during the 14 days before first symptom ( Figure 2 ). While stopped since she suffered from fever with a highest temperature above 39·0℃.
Patient 19 was 41 years old. Her duration of sex behavior was longer than patient 14, which ended at the day she was diagnosed by throat swab. Her first symptom was also fever, but the highest temperature (38·9℃) is lower than patient 14 and her symptoms were mild in need of lower flow of oxygen ( Figure 2 ). Patient 19's partner was clinical diagnosed with COVID-19, while patient 14's was not.
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted using the vaginal environment and anal swab samples of 35 female patients with COVID-19. All the vaginal environment samples (35 cases in total) were negative.

Her husband was also diagnosed with COVID-19, while they had no sexual behavior from 14 days before the first of symptoms to the day samples collected.
The evidence so far suggests that respiratory droplets and intimate contact are the two main transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 [19] [20] [21] [22] . Aerosol transmission also exists in relatively closed unventilated space 23 . Fecal-oral transmission is possible 23 . Vertical transmission have not been verified 16, 23 , although scientists have found that SARS-CoV-2 is positive in feces and blood 15 , while negative in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk 16 . In addition, asymptomatic infected persons are potential sources of infection, with the long incubation period, increasing the difficulty in epidemic prevention and control 24 . Therefore, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still worth exploring.
Herein, we reported a cohort of 35 female patients, with an age range of 37-88.
Additionally, over 54·3% (19/35) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases including cancer (Table 1) , are more susceptible due to the weaker immune function 25 , in accordance with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 5 . There was a special patient undergoing caesarean section due to scar uterus contractions. We obtained the vaginal secretions on the third day after operation and found the SARS-CoV-2 negative similar to breastmilk, anal swab and neonatal throat swab samples. Up to now, no evidence suggested that pregnant women need caesarean section merely because of SARS-CoV-2 positive in mother's throat swab 16 .
Our study showed that female patients with COVID-19 have a similar trait of clinical characteristics to the patients reported recently. Most common first symptom was fever (25, 71·4%). Lymphopenia was a common phenomenon, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might primarily target lymphocytes, like SARS-CoV 5 . IL-2R, IL6, and TNF-α were above the normal range in half patients. A cytokine storm was induced after SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by large amounts of immune responses and changes in immune cells such as lymphocytes, which was same as people infected SARS-CoV 5,26 . Oxygen therapy was used for every patient to improve hypoxia. Most patients received antiviral treatment and antibiotic treatment to inhibit virus All rights reserved.

Glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin therapy used in some patients is in order to inhibit inflammatory response based on ""cytokine storm"" theory. However, some researchers suggested that the use of antibiotics and glucocorticoids are not good for patients due to lacking strong evidence 21 .
Sex behavior is a cluster of intimate contacts involving hugs, kisses, and oral/anal it was probably many patients had hidden their sex history. So, sex partners got infected by the intimate contacts during sex might be more than one in the 42·9% group. If one of the involvers in a sex behavior is in incubation period or is asymptomatic patient, the risk of the other involver got infected is pretty high. As asymptomatic persons are potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection 24 .
Transmission between family members occurred in 13-21% of MERS cases and 22-39% of SARS cases 5 . Moreover, many patients with SARS or MERS were infected through super-spreaders 5 .

First, the sample size was relatively small in which only 35 patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive or CT suspected was included; much more patients including sexually active women are needed to confirm our findings in the future. Second, samples from partner of the patients enrolled is missing, including anal swabs, semen, and urethral orifice swabs. Nevertheless, the data in our study revealed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of female patients with COVID-19 in a new prospective. In summary, though no evidence was found in this study that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by vaginal sex from female to the partner.
Considering the complexity of sexual behavior and the transmission potential of asymptomatic infectives, we suggest that people who lived in the epidemic areas, have tourism history from epidemic areas and were potentially asymptomatic infected should be very cautious about sex behavior and avoid oral/anal sex especially, which may be helpful to prevent further spreading of SARS-CoV-2.

114ed64f52f503d9d2e2ba1fd1ee62b0a168cd84,"China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them.
We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes.
Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized.
Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.

Since its first emergence in Wuhan city in late December 2019, COVID-19 has already spread to 26 countries. As of March 02, 2020, there were over 87137 confirmed cases worldwide, with 2977 deaths. 1 To date, several latest studies have reported the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), including signs, symptoms, laboratory test results, imaging features, therapeutic strategies and effects, and multiple organ dysfunction. [2] [3] [4] [5] Notably, acute myocardial injury (AMI), defined as troponin T-hypersensitivity (TNT-HSST) serum levels > 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/ml) by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force for myocardial infarction and non-myocardial infarction diseases, 6 was detected in approximately 7.2%-12% COVID-19 patients in previous studies. [2] [3] Furthermore, both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been linked to acute myocarditis, AMI, and rapid-onset heart failure. 7-9 Reportedly, 2 nearly 40% of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID- 19 have underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases.
Furthermore, among COVID-19 patients, those with underlying cardiovascular diseases can be more severely affected and may have more adverse outcomes than those without underlying diseases. Thus, undoubtedly, special medical attention should be paid to COVID-19 patients with cardiac complications and underlying All rights reserved.

On February 13, 2020, the ACC released an ACC Clinical Bulletin titled ""Cardiac Implications of Novel Wuhan Coronavirus (COVID-19)"" 10 for addressing cardiac implications of this disease and offering early clinical guidance given the current uncertainty over COVID-19. However, detailed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with cardiac involvement, especially those with AMI, have not been investigated in detail. Thus, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and to further determine the risk factors for AMI in them.
The institutional ethics board of our institutes approved this study (No. 2020.43). We retrospectively enrolled 53 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized between January 02, 2020 and February 14, 2020. The patients were diagnosed and classified according to the World Health Organization interim guidance. 7 NCP types were classified as mild, common, severe, and critically severe according to the COVID-19 patient management guideline issued on February 8, 2020. 11

Laboratory test results including those of blood routine tests, C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer tests, and blood gas analysis were recorded and compared. The levels of cardiac injury markers including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, myoglobin (MYO), amino N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and TNT-HSST were determined at admission. The AMI group was defined as patients with TNT-HSST serum levels > 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/ml). 6 The group with cardiac marker abnormalities but non-definite AMI was defined as patients with TNT-HSST serum levels < 28pg/ml but increase in the levels of any of the other abovementioned cardiac markers. The group without cardiac marker abnormalities comprised patients without elevation in the levels of any of the cardiac markers. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed on the day of admission. The period of illness onset to admission was defined from the day when signs or symptoms were first noticed to the day of admission. All enrolled patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography (2D echo) and electrocardiography (ECG) during hospitalization.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was identified according to the Berlin definition 12 and acute kidney injury (AKI) according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition. 13

Furthermore, the mean systolic blood pressure of the AMI patients was higher than those of the other two groups (p<0.001). Fifteen (28%) of all the patients had tachycardia.
High occurrence of hypertension was detected in the AMI patients (total patients with hypertension: n=8, 15.09%; AMI group: n=4, 66.67%; cardiac marker abnormalities group: n=2, 8.33%; without cardiac marker abnormalities group: n=2, 8.69%; p=0.001). Cardiovascular diseases were more frequently found in the AMI patients, all of whom had coronary artery disease, with one having prior coronary artery bypass grafting (total patients with cardiovascular disease: n=6, 11.32%; AMI group: n=4, 66.67%), compared with the groups with and without cardiac marker abnormalities (p=0.001). Additionally, diabetes (n=8, 15.09%) and COPD (n=3, 5.6%) were found in all the patients, with a higher tendency in the AMI group (diabetes: n=2 and COPD: n=2) than in the other two groups (Figure 1) . Notably, only the AMI patients had more than two comorbidities (n=5).
Regarding CT or DR findings on admission, all the AMI patients and 21 (87.5%) non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities had bilateral multilobular and sub-segmental lung involvement; in the without cardiac marker abnormalities group, bilateral lobes were affected in only 15 (65.22%) patients.

Initial lymphocyte counts of five (83.33%) AMI patients were decreased below the normal range (0.80-4.00 × 10 9 /l); these counts were decreased in only nine (37.5%) and eight (34.78%) patients with and without cardiac marker abnormalities, respectively.
Furthermore, red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count of the AMI group were lower than those of the other two groups (p<0.05); four (66.67%) AMI patients had procalcitonin levels above the normal range (0-0.5 ng/ml).
Over half (n=30, 56.6%) of the COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated cardiac marker levels. Cardiac marker levels were higher in the AMI and non-definite AMI patients than in those without cardiac marker abnormities (p<0.05; Figure S1 in supplementary appendix).

Meanwhile, there were some differences in echo and ECG findings ( Table 2) . Of all the COVID-19 patients, 45.28% (n=24) patients exhibited echo abnormalities. Echo abnormalities more frequently occurred in the AMI group and included left atrial enlargement (n=2), left ventricular (LV) enlargement (n=2), LV diastolic dysfunction (n=3), mitral valve regurgitation (n=2), triple valve regurgitation (n=1), and aortic valve regurgitation (n=1). Three AMI patients had LV wall thickening. It is noteworthy that non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities also had high frequency of echo abnormalities (n=15, 62.50%), with 11(45.83%) of them having more than two of the abovementioned echo abnormalities. The most frequent echo abnormality in the cardiac marker abnormalities group was LV diastolic dysfunction (n=14, 58.33%). Table 3 , 11 (20.75%) COIVD-19 patients had ECG abnormalities, including all the AMI patients and five (20.83%) non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Five of the AMI patients had more than two kinds of ECG abnormalities including atrioventricular block (n=2), ST-T/Q curve abnormalities (n=2), and arrhythmia (n=3); furthermore, ST-T/Q curve abnormalities (n=5, 20.83%) and arrhythmia (n=1, 4.27%) were the main abnormalities in patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. None of the patients without cardiac marker abnormalities exhibited ECG abnormalities.

In the AMI group, in addition to antiviral and antibiotic therapies, cardioprotective medications such as amiodarone and cedilla were used by four patients to improve the cardiac function. However, the non-definite AMI patients with and without cardiac markers abnormalities did not use cardioprotective medication. All the 53 patients were administered nasal cannula oxygen therapy during admission for respiratory support; non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was performed for five AMI and three non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Notably, in the AMI group, invasive mechanical ventilation was used in three patients and ECMO in one patient due to extremely severe ARDS.
ARDS occurred in all the six AMI patients and four non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities. Hypoxemia was a common complication that affected 19 (35.85%) of the 53 study patients, with a significant difference in the number of affected patients between the AMI (n=6, 100%) and non-definite AMI with cardiac marker abnormalities (n=10, 41.67%) groups and the without cardiac marker abnormalities group (n=3, 13.04%; p<0.001). Moreover, a total of five AMI patients had AKI, and four of them used continuous renal replacement therapy.
Importantly, all the six AMI patients had critically severe NCP and needed care in intensive care unit (ICU).

Moreover, AMI was detected in 6 of the 53 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. All the six patients had severe or critically severe NCP and required ICU care. Of the six AMI patients, three died, two remained hospitalized, and one was discharged. Notably, CRP levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the major risk factors for AMI in the COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, there were 24 (45%) COVID-19 patients with elevation in the levels of one or more myocardial enzymes and markers of myocardial damage whose features did not meet the strict definition of myocardial injury, with most of them having the common NCP type and experiencing quick recovery; however, 58.33% of these patients exhibited LV dysfunction on echo, and long-term outcomes should be observed via follow-up in a future study.
Our study results suggest that the rates of cardiac complications were high in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially in patients with confirmed AMI from among those who required ICU care. As shown in a recent report on 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 2 16 .7% of the patients developed arrhythmia and 7.2% developed acute cardiac injury. In another series of 41 cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it has been reported that 5 (12%) patients were diagnosed with acute cardiac injury.

However, further evidence is urgently needed to assess the mechanism of cardiac damage in large-sample autopsy or biopsy studies. Previous studies have indicated that SARS-CoV can mediate MI and damage associated with the downregulation of the myocardial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 system; this may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS, which has also been detected in COVID-19 patients. [19] [20] [21] [22] Until now, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Although full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, the pathophysiological mechanism of cardiac infection or damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further validated in future studies. 23 In our study, AMI usually occurred in COVID-19 patients with old age, underlying comorbidities, severe or critically severe NCP, and ARDS. Among 44,672 patients with confirmed COVID-19, as reported in the China CDC Weekly on Feb 11, 2020, approximately 31.2% patients were aged >60 years. The overall case fatality rate was 2.3% (1,023 deaths); more importantly, the majority (81%) of deaths occurred in patients aged ≥ 60 years or in those with underlying medical conditions. 24 Similarly, in our study, all the six AMI patients were aged >60 years and had one or more underlying conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and cardiovascular diseases.

Meanwhile, ARDS was present in all the AMI patients. ARDS, as a severe complication, occurred in approximately 19%-29% NCP patients as per previous reports. [2] [3] [4] [5] Thus, we must understand the mechanisms of heart-lung interactions in ARDS patients, particularly the right ventricle function impairments caused by respiratory dysfunction. 26 Logistic regression analysis indicated that NCP severity was a risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, the outcomes of these patients need to be further determined in long-term follow-up studies.
Our study has some limitations. First, this is a modest-size case series of hospitalized COVID-19 patients; more standardized data from a larger cohort would beneficial for further determining the clinical characteristics. Second, our data showed the clinical characteristics of AMI induced by COVID-19, including the clinical presentations, electrophysiological abnormality, myocardial enzyme and myocardial injury marker levels, and cardiac dysfunction and enlargement. However, the tissue characteristics in myocardial damage (i.e., edema, fibrosis, and microcirculation disorder) should be further demonstrated via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging examination as far as possible under the premise of controlling transmission. Finally, most of the COVID-19 patients with AMI had severe or critically severe NCP and high fatality rate, but long-term follow-up should be performed to determine adverse cardiac All rights reserved.

In summary, we found that cardiovascular complications are common in COVID-19 patients and include tachycardia, elevated myocardial enzyme levels, cardiac dysfunction, and even AMI. More importantly, CRP level elevation, NCP severity, and underlying cardiovascular diseases are the major risk factors for AMI in these patients.

11875dfda6cd04d5032611edf0e340582ceb620f,"An outbreak of new SARS-like viral in Wuhan, China has been named 2019-nCoV. The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV.","In the past of 18 years, many researchers have done lots of work on etiology mechanism related to SARS, and Spike glycoprotein (S-protein) was confirmed to be a key for entering human cell by binding with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 1 .
Recently, a new type of pneumonia which is caused by 2019-nCoV has outbroken nationwide in China and the previous studies have shown that 2019-nCoV is like SARS-CoV. In the last few days, several 2019-nCoV strains have been successfully separated from patients and the results of sequencing data can be acquired on Sharing Avian Influenza Data and GenBank.
According to the evolutionary analysis of coronavirus, 2019-nCov is probably originated from bat, and the Sprotein of 2019-nCoV may enter human cells by interacting with human ACE2 receptor, which revealed the pathopoeia mechanism of 2019-nCoV 1 . On the other hand, 2019-nCoV shares about 96.2% sequence identity to BatCoV RATG13 2 . By comparing the amino acid sequence of 2019-nCoV S-protein (GenBank Accession: MN908947.3) with Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, the latter two were shown to share 89.1% and 88.6% sequence identity to 2019-nCoV S-protein (supplementary figure 1) . Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV may share the same pathway with Bat SARS-like coronavirus.
However, the existing studies used swiss-model need further optimization, for example, the ligand binding site on the predicted S-protein structure are still not clear. Additionally, the template only shares 76.4% sequence identity, which means the result may not fully reflect the reality. Thus, a new method to predict the threedimensional structure and related functions of proteins from another perspective and most importantly, a new method to predict potential drug target may need to be applied.
Iterative Threading Assembly Refinement (I-TASSER) is a layered method for protein structure and function prediction 3 .It firstly identifies the structural template from the PDB through the local meta-threaded method (LOMETS), and then constructs the full-length atomic model through the fragment assembly simulation based on the iterative template. Next, the 3D model is re-woven into the thread through BioLiP, the protein function database, to yield a functional insight into the target. In the recent protein structure predictions for CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, CASP10, CASP11, CASP12 and CASP13, I-TASSER remains one of the best method for the automated protein structure prediction 3 .
Phyre2 is a tool which uses remote homology detection methods to build 3D models, predict ligand binding sites and analyse the effect of amino-acid variants. The difference between Phyre2 and other methods is not accuracy but ease of use 4 .
Therefore, I-TASSER and Phyre2 were used to predict the structure of spike protein in Wuhan pneumonia (GenBank: MN908947.3).
The latest 2019-ncov sequences (Supplementary Table 1; in total 33 strains analyzed) from GISAID and MN908947.3 sequences published on NCBI were collected and analyzed. MEGA(Version 7.026) was used to align 33 nucleotide sequences. The aligned nucleotide sequences were constructed by NJ method.
Using online tools blast (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to analyse MN908947.3 amino acid sequence and the 33 2019-nCoV sequences downloaded from GISAID.
The MN908947.3 spike protein sequence was first extracted from GenBank file, the sequence was then submitted to the online tools (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) which uses existing model to predict protein structure. Parameters were not assigned to other constraints, all template libraries of I-TASSER were selected, and secondary structures of specific residues were not specified for protein structure analysis.
This section reports biological annotations of the target protein by COFACTOR and COACH based on the I-TASSER structure prediction. COFACTOR deduces protein functions (ligand-binding sites, EC and GO) by using structure comparison and protein-protein networks. COACH is a meta-server approach that combines multiple function annotation results (on ligand-binding sites) from COFACTOR, TM-SITE and S-SITE programs.
The MN908947.3 spike protein amino acid sequence was submitted to the online tools (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index) which uses existing model to predict protein sequences.
So far, variability analysis of the known 33 coronavirus sequences showed that during the one-month period of transmission of pneumonia in Wuhan (2019.12.24-2020.01.29), all viral RNA sequences had a Query Cover greater than 99.9% compared with the sequence was matched (MN908947.3).There was no significant variation in the virus, so the analysis of MN908947.3 could be applied to the prevalent Wuhan pneumonia species (excluding BetaCoV/Kanagawa/1/2020|EPI_ISL_402126).
In addition, in the phylogenetic tree, the evolution of 33 virus samples was divided into three categories.Clade A is basically unchanged nucleotide sequence, Clade B is A sample with individual site variation (site<=3), and Clade C is A single sample (site=5).The distance scale of the tree is 0.0001.

The results showed that five predicted protein structure models (named as model1-5, respectively) were co-existed, and the changes of normalized B factor 5 of each model were shown in figure 2. A total of 5 models were generated, which were sorted according to the clustering size, and the local structure accuracy curve of each model was shown (supplementary figure 3) . The local accuracy is defined as the distance deviation (in Angstrom) between the position of residues in the model and the original structure, and the size of its C score is given in Supplementary Table 2 .
Phyre2: Phyre2 analytical model is based on c5x5b B (PDB ID) (supplementary figure 4) , which models 1049 residues (82.1% of the sequence) with a confidence of 100.0% from a single highest scoring template. Table 3 , the top 10 known proteins in I-TASSER with the highest structural similarity to the prediction model with the highest score were listed (all structures in the PDB library were matched by tmalign). After analyzing the structures of these 10 known proteins, it was found that only the first two (PDB ID: 5x58 A and 6nzk A) were coronavirus proteins. Moreover, 5x58, which ranks the first, is the spike trimer of SARS, which is exactly consistent with our prediction that the nucleotide sequence was inferred to be spike. Reports on 5x58 indicated that spike was divided into four structural domains, among which C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1s) binds ACE2 as receptor binding domain (figure 4c) 6 . After combining 5x58 with I-TASSER prediction model (figure 4d), there were similar up and down proteins. This indicated that the binding of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to human cells and the conformation of CTD1 may also change from downward to upward, making ACE2 binding to RBD unimpeded.
In the functional prediction model of proteins, binding sites ranking from 1st to 5th were PDB ID 7 : 3srcA (C Sore=0.05), 1a5tA (C Sore= 0.03), 4dv3B (C Sore= 0.03), 4fmal (C Sore= 0.03), and 5hhja (C Sore= 0.02) (Supplementary Table 4 ), respectively. Further analysis of the binding site ranking the first showed that it was the binding site of Acyl-homoserine lactone acylase (PvdQ) which catalyzes the deacylation of acylhomoserine lactone (AHL or acyl-HSL), releasing homoserine lactone (HSL) and the corresponding fatty acid (figure 3), and the residues of binding site were Thr-874, Leu-877, and Leu-878 with binding affinity IC50=130 µM (from pdbbind-cn).
In the receptor results, 3src was ranked the first (3src is the PDB ID of PvdQ,), and its predicted binding 
In this study, the nucleotide interval of the surface glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV was analyzed and it was similar to the spike interval of SARS-CoV 8 . Three-dimensional structure prediction of protein showed that the prediction model with the highest score in I-TASSER was comparable to the 5x58 spike protein electron microscope results, and the prediction model with the highest score in phyre2 was comparable to the 5x5b SARS-CoV spike protein. Moreover, the prediction model in I-TASSER was highly similar to that in 5x58 which indirectly makes the nucleotide interval 2019-nCoV, indicating that the possibility of glycoprotein expression was increased again.
In addition, the 3D structure of CTD1 in the binding region of SARS-CoV and ACE2 was enlarged. In figure  4a and figure 4d , it was observed that there was a high degree of overlap between the S2 subunit of SARS-author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

CoV and the prediction model of 2019-nCoV, and the prediction model with conformation up and down was in line with the actual model of spike of SARS. Therefore, we speculated that 2019-nCoV and SARS may have the same ACE2 binding model. Previous studies built a preliminary 3D model of 2019-nCoV using the Swiss method, and the researchers found that compared with SARS, the 2019-nCOV changed four key bases, but its 3D conformation did not change significantly 1 . In our 2019-nCoV 3D model, we found that 2019-nCoV was highly similar to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) domain of SARS-CoV. The main chains of the two protein models were highly coincident and the conformation was in the same direction, and the possibility of combining 2019-nCoV with ACE2 was increased from another perspective.
In previous reports, ACE2 was highly expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells 9 , and in the eyes of the aqueous humor, cornea and conjunctiva 10, 11 . In the most recent cases, people with conjunctivitis and diarrhea were infected. Therefore, from this perspective, it can also be explained that the entry pathway of 2019-nCov in human may be binding to ACE2 receptor. If this inference is true, then healthy people should also be careful to treat patients' feces. and people who go to places with high virus density (such as fever clinic) must pay attention to eye protection measures to prevent the viral infection through the Aqueous humor.
Here we suggest that 28N may be a potential drug target for 2019-nCoV. According to Coach analysis, we found that 28N could be an strong ligand to bing the S protein. In past studies, it was found that 28N can strongly bind PvdQ, and the residues near its binding site are T166, L169 and L170 12 . In the spatial structure simulation of S protein of 2019-ncov, we found that S protein has a three-dimensional structure highly cosimilar to PvdQ. More importantly, its binding site residues are also T874, L877 and L878, which are almost exactly matched. This conclusion indicates that 28N can bind to S protein. A search on the pubchem platform revealed that seven of the eight BioAssay Results listed as active were as inhibitors and one as stimulants. We speculate that 28N can inhibit the activity of S protein of 2019-ncov, but more experiments are needed to confirm this conclusion.
Previous reports have suggested that the conformational transformation of CTD1 from bottom to top was a prerequisite for receptor binding 13 , and that the spike protein of 2019-nCoV should also be trimer. A switch with more than one ""up"" CTD1 conformation will result in cleavage of the S1-ACE2 complex. Therefore, the research on new pneumonia drugs can also start from how to make spike trimer to turn on the upward switch. Antibodies against ACE2 or any compound that can bind to ACE2 are expected to be used in 2019-nCoV therapy, and the recognition of receptor binding sites will also contribute to the development of 2019-nCoV vaccine.
In conclusion, two different deep learning-based models of protein structure prediction were used to show that the binding domain of 2019-nCov was highly conserved to the CTD1 region of the spike protein of SARS. In the functional prediction of protein, 28N or its molecules with similar structuresmay be used as a potential drug target to hydrolyze 2019-nCoV. Hopefully this study can help to develop new drug for the therapy of 2019-nCoV. Fig.1 Evolutionary relationships.

11edcc84add7b4bfe1f7cc84068a06ff9b7398b2,,"In December 2019, several cases of severe pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China. The outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2 [1] and the disease (COVID- 19) started to spread rapidly [2] in Wuhan. As of 19 February 2020, globally 75,204 cases have been confirmed with 2,009 deaths in 26 countries [3] . In China, 83·2% (62,031/74,576) of the confirmed cases were located in Hubei province and 60·4% (45,027/74,576) were located in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak originated [4, 5] . The ""pneumonia of unknown etiology"" appeared in Wuhan from 8 December 2019. Many early cases have been reported to be linked to the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market (hereafter referred to as ""the Market"") [6] . By 2 January 2020, 41 initial cases were confirmed as COVID-19 [7] . As the novel coronavirus epidemic was spreading within Wuhan, the Chinese New Year/Spring Festival (25 January 2020), the most important holiday in China, was approaching. In 2019, 2.99 billion of people traveled by bus, train, and plane during 40 days around Chinese New Year [8] . Wuhan, with a population size of 11 million, is one of the four most important railway hubs in China. With billions of people travelling and lots of family and friends gathering, there was greatly increased risk of rapidly spreading this newly emerging infectious disease, nationally, and even globally. On 19 January 2020, the first confirmed COVID-19 case outside of Wuhan appeared in Shenzhen, Guangdong [9] . As of 23 January 2020, confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in 29 provinces of mainland China and nine countries and areas outside of mainland China [10, 11] . On the same day, the central government of the People's Republic of China initiated a lockdown in Wuhan and two nearby prefectural cities, Huanggang and Ezhou, in Hubei province, to prevent spreading of the COVID-19 outbreak [12, 13] . However, as many cases had ""escaped"" from Wuhan before the lockdown, COVID-19 has spread to most provinces. The numbers of cases imported from Wuhan for different provinces heavily depend on their connectivities with Wuhan. At the same time, municipalities responded differently, regarding timeliness and adequacy of measures (including declarations of public health emergency, holiday extension, event cancelation, and surveillance using infrared thermometers in public spaces. In this study, we used a method for analysing transmission patterns based on the serial interval between clinical cases of COVID-19 [14] . Based on dates of symptom onset and contact information for confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tianjin province, it was possible to estimate the serial interval distribution. With this information, it was possible to estimate numbers of new cases caused by any subject infectious with COVID-19, or their reproduction numbers during early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan. More importantly, we examined the heterogeneity in transmission among 30 provinces of mainland China and also among 20 cities in Guangdong province. Table 1 here.
First, detailed data for 112 confirmed cases between 21 Jan 2020 and 12 Feb 2020 in Tianjin province was obtained from the website of Tianjin Health Commission, the website of Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the official Weibo (China's Twitter equivalent) of a local newspaper [15, 16, 17] . Collected information included demographic information, travel history to Wuhan/Hubei, date of symptom onset, and any contact information that could be found. See Table 1 for a summary. Second, to evaluate the role of ""the Market"" in Wuhan and estimate the numbers of cases caused by contact with this source (its reproduction number) in early transmission, data for the first confirmed 425 COVID-19 cases with date of symptom onset and exposure information to ""the Market"" was extracted from a recently published report [6] . And in third place, we collected epidemic curve data: numbers of cases by province and date of confirmation from the Wikipedia page of COVID-19 cases in mainland China [18] and combined these data with detailed information, wherever available, about travel history and location (city and district) extracted from announcements of the Health Commissions of the provinces. These data were used to compare transmission of COVID-19 in different provinces and cities. Since the travel history to Wuhan is currently not available for all cases outside of Wuhan, the probability that any confirmed cases were linked with Wuhan was estimated using the 228 confirmed cases with known travel history between 20 January 2020 to 3 February 2020 in Beijing.
Adopting terminology of Teunis et al. [14] a transmission probability matrix V can be defined where element v i,j is the probability that subject i was infected by another subject j; v i is a vector of transmission probabilities linking case i to any other case. The total number of observed subjects is n. Elements of V can be estimated by utilizing a distance kernel κ i,j (X i,j |i ← j), that defines a pairwise likelihood that subject i was infected by subject j. The distribution of the serial interval ( Figure 1a ): the distance in time between pairs of cases defines a practical distance kernel, translating the time intervals between symptom onsets in any two cases into a likelihood that these cases were linked as a transmission pair [19] . As outlined in [14] , the elements of the transmission probability matrix V may be estimated in a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. The elements of the transmission matrix are subject to constraints. Diagonal elements must be zero (subjects cannot infect themselves) and rows must add to 1 (unless the parent of the corresponding subject was not observed). Additional constraints may be imposed, for instance by preventing links between subjects known to have not been in contact. A mask matrix M (n × n, like V ) may be defined, with elements 1 where links are admissible, and 0 where they are not. This mask M may be applied to the matrix of kernels κ i,j () by elementwise multiplication. Elements of V representing pairs of subjects with inadmissible links are thus excluded: the corresponding v i,j are set to zero, and they are not updated in MCMC estimation. The mask M can be used to define contacts: whenever subject i is known to have been in contact with another subject j element m i,j = 1. And perhaps more importantly: when subject i is known to not have had contact with subject k then m i,k = 0.
When a sufficient number of infectious contacts is known, the serial interval distribution may be estimated from outbreak data. First, the elements of the transmission probability matrix V are estimated, using (plausible) starting values for the parameters of the serial interval distribution. Then, V is fixed and the serial interval distribution parameters are estimated. Then the serial interval distribution is fixed and V is estimated. This alternating procedure can be repeated until no more improvement (in posterior probability) is found [14] . In the present analyses a special node (0) was defined, that has a uniform kernel κ i,0 : any subject can be infected by node 0 at any time, within a given time range. Outside that time range κ i,0 = 0. Such a node could represent environmental transmission, i.e. from ""the Market"" to anyone in contact with that environment, or contact with a pool of infectious subjects, i.e. from any infectious subjects within Wuhan/Hubei to subjects outside of Wuhan/Hubei. As the outbreak progressed, travel to Wuhan became increasingly less likely, especially after the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on 23 January 2020. However, contacts did not cease abruptly: travel records from the confirmed cases in Beijing showed a gradually decreasing probability of contact with Wuhan. Therefore the probability of linking any confirmed cases outside Hubei province to Wuhan was modelled as a logistic function of the date of confirmation
where t is the number of days after 20 February 2020. The parameters were estimated using the travel history records from the 228 confirmed cases in Beijing. The fitted logistic relation was then used to impute contacts with Wuhan sources for all cases outside Hubei province with unknown travel history. Once infection has been imported from Wuhan, further transmission depends on local contacts: all cases cannot be assumed to be fully connected. Local contacts were imputed by distributing cases within a province or city into clusters. Cases within a cluster were assumed fully connected while cases in different clusters were not connected, thus allowing only transmission within a cluster and not between clusters. Cluster size was assumed random, with average size five people, and a high probability (88·8%) of small clusters (average 1 to 5 people) and a low probability (11·2%) of medium to large clusters (average 10 to 25 people). The transmission probability matrix may be used to estimate reproduction numbers by calculating the row sums
that represent expected numbers of cases infected by infectious case j (its outdegree), or its reproduction number. Reproduction numbers thus are calculated for individual subjects. Therefore they can be grouped in any way useful: by time, to illustrate the progression of transmission during the outbreak; by location, to illustrate spatial variation in transmission; or by other characteristics, like age or gender. In order to translate the transmission probability matrix into a transmission network a multinomial sample of size 1 and probability vector row v i reduces the vector v i to a binary vector with exactly one element 1 and the rest zero. This reduced matrix may be interpreted as an adjacency 5 .

For 112 confirmed cases in Tianjin between 21 January 2020 and 12 February 2020, the transmission network could be estimated based on the dates of symptom onset, augmented by contact information between cases. Table 1 shows some summary statistics of demographic and contact information for those cases in Tianjin. As contacts between many of the cases could be identified, so that many elements of the transmission probability matrix were known, joint estimation of the remaining unknown contact probabilities and the serial interval distribution was feasible. With a prior for the serial interval distribution set as Gamma(4,2), 1,000 updates were performed, alternating between probability transmission matrix and serial interval distribution parameters, with 100 iterations for each update and the best fit parameters were chosen as those with the highest posterior probability. Figure 2 shows an estimated (posterior mode) transmission network. Using the available contact information, there appeared to be considerable variation in the sizes of clusters of cases. There were two major clusters: one among crew members of Tianjin railway and another one among sales representatives and customers in Baodi department store. Figure 1b shows the posterior mode serial interval distribution as a gamma distribution (shape parameter 3·16, scale parameter 1·52), with a mean of 4·8 days. This best fit serial interval distribution has been used in all following analyses. Figure 3 shows estimated reproduction numbers by day for the initial 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan. ""The market"" node as an infectious source was linked to as many as 13·6 cases, on average. For those 425 initial cases, the mean reproduction number was 2·5 (until 31 December 2019). The estimated numbers of imported cases from Wuhan varied among provinces in mainland China. Provinces bordering Hubei province include Henan, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi (213, 175, 163, 146), and provinces with close economic ties with Hubei province include Zhejiang and Guangdong (271 and 228, respectively). These provinces all had high estimated numbers of cases imported from Wuhan by 3 February 2020 (Figure 4b ).
Outside Hubei there was less transmission than within Hubei province, with average reproduction numbers between 1 and 2 during the first five days after the first confirmed local case. The provinces Guizhou, Hebei, Shandong, and Guangdong had higher average reproduction numbers: 2·25, 2·14, 1·95, and 1·91, respectively (Figure 4a ). Though the average reproduction numbers were not very high, there existed large variations in reproduction numbers of individual cases, which indicated some individual cases could have spread the disease to many people ( Figure 2 ). Within a province, there was also spatial variation in the amount of transmission. Figure 5 shows the disease transmission in 21 cities within Guangdong province. Shenzhen and Guangdong, the two largest and most affluent urban centers in Guangdong, had the highest estimated numbers of cases imported from Wuhan (127 and 124, respectively) by 3 February 2020. Guangzhou, Zhaoqing, Shaoguan, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai had reproduction numbers slightly larger than 1 (1·35, 1·31, 1·30, 1·10 and 1·05, respectively) for first five days after the first confirmation of a local case in the city. Figures A1 and A2 show boxplots of estimated reproduction numbers for provinces in China and cities in Guandong province, respectively. Figure A3 shows reproduction number estimates by gender and age for Beijing and Tianjin.
Spreading patterns of COVID-19 at different spatial scales, from local (railway department and department store) to regional (cities within Guangdong Province) to nationwide (Provinces within China), appear similar: new cases arise from contacts with a reservoir, spreading to remote locations through travel from the origin outbreak region. There likely is some secondary spread locally, from cases infected from the reservoir, but local reproduction numbers are low, often insufficient to support sustained transmission. Knowledge of the serial interval, for symptomatic cases in the outbreak, is essential for analysis of the transmission probabilities [14] . Previous studies have estimated the distribution of serial intervals from a set of confirmed transmission pairs, where both the ancestor (who caused infection) and the descendant (who became infected) were known [19, 20] . As such information is mostly lacking [6] (and may be hard to obtain) in this COVID-19 outbreak, we have estimated the serial interval distribution from a curated network, using whatever contact information was available. Existing knowledge of contacts (and timing of those contacts) between cases was used to construct a matrix of prior probabilities, to restrict the transmission network to only those links that are possible. When all transmission links are known, the serial interval distribution can be easily estimated. However, at early stages of an outbreak, information on transmission links is usually incomplete. When a sufficiently large proportion of the transmission links is known, it is possible to estimate both the serial interval distribution, and the transmission probability matrix [14] . Starting from a plausible serial interval distribution, the transmission probability matrix V is updated until convergence; then V is frozen and the serial interval parameters are updated, again until obtaining a new optimum; then the serial interval distribution is frozen and the transmission probability matrix is updated again, and so on, until no further improvement can be found. The estimated serial interval distribution, Gamma(3·16,1·52), has a mean of 4·8 days and good spread out (i.e. large scale parameter) to long serial interval. The variation of serial interval could caused by highly varied incubation period [21] . Such a short serial interval, compared to SARS (mean: 8·4 days) [22] and MERS (mean: 6·8 days) [23], gives COVID-19 ability to spread more rapidly. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Korea (from 31 cases on 18 February to 2,022 cases on 28 February) and Italy (from 20 cases on 21 February to 650 cases on 28 February), shows how missed infectious subjects may cause rapid transmission within a very short period, due to the combination of a short serial interval and an occasionally high reproduction number [24] . As the incubation period seems to be highly variable, it may be possible that appearance of symptoms in any case precedes symptom onset in its ancestor. When that happens, the serial interval for symptom onset is negative. To check whether negative serial intervals would adversely affect analysis we used an alternative distribution, where the serial intervals were shifted leftward by a small amount. A shift of one or two days had no destructive effect on estimation of V , and the resulting estimates of the effective reproduction numbers did not change substantially.

Currently, the source of COVID-19 is still unclear but many of the early cases were reported to have had contact with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A recent announcement released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences indicated that the source may not have come from this Seafood Market [25] . Any patient zero would have occurred before the initial 425 confirmed cases, but lacking any specific information about early spread of COVID-19, it can be assumed that a reservoir of infectious subjects could function as a super-spreading node causing new infections upon contact at any time within the outbreak. Assuming such a source for the initial cluster in Wuhan (""the Market"") led to an estimated basic reproduction number 13·6. It must be noted that this environmental ""super-spreading node"" is hypothetical, and represents the production of new cases by the joint presence of infectious subjects connected to the initial source. There was strong heterogeneity in disease transmission in different provinces of mainland China. The present analysis produces two relevant characteristics: the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan, and the average reproduction number for the first five days after any confirmed imported case in each province. When there are many imported cases from Wuhan, these constitute a large base number of cases to start local spreading of the disease. Provinces geographically close to Hubei province are expected to experience mass migration from Wuhan, especially near the holiday season. Provinces with big tier-1 cities like Zhejiang and Guangdong both have very high estimated numbers of cases imported from Wuhan due to their economic connection with Hubei. When early transmission has a high reproduction number, local growth rate in a province will be high. Provinces geographically distant from Hubei, like Hebei, Guizhou, and Shandong, appear to have relatively high reproduction numbers during early local transmission. In provinces distant from Wuhan, the central hub of the outbreak, inhabitants and local governments may have been less cautious (with few public and personal prevention measures) considering high costs of interventions and perceived low risk. Since Guangdong province has both large numbers of imported cases and high reproduction numbers for early transmission, we further examined the transmission inside of Guangdong by city. Shenzhen and Guangzhou, two of the biggest cities in China, had many imported cases. This is expected considering intense economic connectivity: transportation links, for goods and people including enormous numbers of migrant workers working in those two cities. The numbers of cases imported from Wuhan into other cities in Guangdong province was smaller. This pattern matches the flow of people in public transport (by train and airplane) converging onto the main transportation hubs (Shenzen and Guangzhou) and diverging from there towards other destinations in Guangdong province. For early transmission following import from Wuhan, the reproduction number in most cities in Guangdong had an average reproduction number around 1, during the first five days. With appropriate and sustained disease prevention and control measures (e.g. suspension public transportation, cancellation of mass gatherings, implementation of surveillance, and promotion of wearing face masks and personal hygiene), the outbreak is unlikely to spread out in those cities. Among reported cases, gender differences seemed unimportant; most serious illnesses occurred among the elderly, in particular those with health problems prior to infection, while only a small proportion of cases were young of age [21] . In the present study, when reproduction 8 .

Similarly, estimates of transmission from different age groups showed that small children and elderly people were equally likely to transmit infection as any other age group ( Figure A3 ). We also examined the effect of the size of clusters imputed on the results and the difference was trivial between average cluster size three and five. An important issue in analyzing transmission of COVID-19 is the amount of silent transmission. As mentioned earlier, some infectious subjects may transmit their infection before they become symptomatic. As long as their descendant cases also go on to develop symptoms their transmission link may still be established. However, when infected subjects who remain completely asymptomatic could be infectious to susceptible contacts, the appearance of such contacts, when symptomatic, could not be linked to their immediate ancestors. Given the fact that symptoms seem to be milder in those who are young, such unobservable transmission cannot be excluded [26] . Silent transmission has been seen in other infectious diseases [27] where, notably, asymptomatically infected subjects appeared to cause fewer transmission. As asymptomatic infections would lead to an antibody response, serology could be a valuable tool to assess the importance of asymptomatic transmission.

11f96d05db6854ef95312aa3a4736724ce1f02d6,"We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.

Sensitising arriving travellers to the symptoms and risk of SARS-CoV-2 and to encourage selfisolation as well as rapidly seeking for medical assistance via telephone which in turn will trigger tracing and quarantine of contacts, may have a more pronounced effect and is currently implemented in many transport hubs. However, with increasing numbers of infected travellers contact tracing is unlikely to be sustainable for long because of the immensely resourceintensive nature of contact tracing and hence is similarly unlikely to prevent local transmission in the long term (7) .
If containment is impossible, another key target of the pandemic response is to delay local spread (8) . This will allow additional time for preparation of the health system and mobilisation of additional public health resources. Delaying local spread will also allow for crucial time to better understand the pathogen and to evaluate effective treatment and prevention measures. We aim to estimate the effectiveness of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation for delaying the onset of sustained SARS-CoV-2 spread in previously unaffected regions.
We represent the potential importation of infections by an average number of infected travellers per week, λ , attempting to travel to a specific country or region currently not experiencing an outbreak. We assume that individuals with severe symptoms do not attempt to travel, though travellers may develop severe symptoms en route. Upon arrival, we assume all infected travellers have the same distribution of potential secondary infections, determined by the average number of those infections, ܴ , and the dispersion of that number, ݇ . Following Hartfield and Alizon (9) 
We represent syndromic screening effects by the probability of missing an infected traveller, θ . When screening is implemented, the average number of infected travellers arriving in a week reduces from λ to θ λ and thereby increases ‫ݐ‬ Ԣ
. For the scenarios we consider, we assume the same baseline assumptions as in Quilty et al (6) ; i.e. a syndromic screening sensitivity of 86%, travel duration of 12 hours, and average times from infection to onset of symptoms and from onset to severe symptoms/hospitalisation as 5.2 and 9.2 days, respectively. For those assumptions, Quilty et al estimate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers not being detected at either exit or entry screening as 46% and as 42% for exit-only screening (6) .
We represent traveller sensitisation as reducing . Sensitisation occurs via, e.g., posters and handouts to travellers arriving from high risk regions, which increases the likelihood that those travellers, if they experience SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, will self-isolate on the occurrence of mild symptoms and rapidly report to health care providers who in turn trigger contact tracing. As a base case, in line with Hellewell et al (7) we assume that these measures to accelerate self-isolation and reporting in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can reduce the average number of onward transmitting secondary infections by about 50%.
To determine the impact of interventions, we calculate the difference in time to outbreak occurrence with and without interventions: 
We considered three syndromic screening intervention scenarios: no screening, exit-only, and exit-and-entry screening. We further considered two scenarios of traveller sensitisation: 0%, and 50% effectiveness. No screening and 0% sensitisation effectiveness form the non-intervention reference. These are studied in the context of either 1, 10 or 100 infected travellers per week. We assume that ܴ is gamma distributed with an inner 95% range from 1.4 to 3.9 (10) and that its dispersion is k=0.54 (11) .
For sensitivity analyses, we also investigate alternative scenarios for the dispersion of ܴ and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. All scenarios and parameters are summarised in Table 1 .

A proportion of infected travellers will be detected through syndromic exit or entry screening and will immediately be isolated and not cause secondary cases in the yet unaffected destination. Sensitised travellers will enter the destination but cause fewer secondary cases because of an increased likelihood of self-isolation and rapid care-seeking.
In the case of the slowest arrival rate, 1 infected traveller per week, the combination of traveller sensitisation and exit and entry screening, the expected benefit (50% of simulations predict delays at least as large as this) is a delay of 83 days (75%: 36 days, 97.5% 8 days) (Table 2, Figure 2 ). If 10 infected travellers per week are simulated the outbreak delay reduces to 8 days (75% 4 days, 97.5%: 1 day).
The incremental benefit of syndromic entry screening is highly dependent on the effectiveness of exit screening. With one infected traveller per week, traveller sensitisation and under baseline assumptions of exit screening effectiveness but no entry screening, the outbreak is delayed by 76 days (75%: 33 days, 97.5%: 7 days), indicating that additional entry screening adds little in this case.

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint We estimate that with no traveller sensitisation and under baseline assumptions for the effectiveness of syndromic screening at exit and entry, in the early stages of the outbreak with 1 infected traveller per week, an outbreak may be delayed by 9 days (75%: 4, 97.5%: less than 1 day). Again, this is largely due to exit screening at departure, which on its own is estimated to delay the outbreak by 8 days (75%: 3 days, 97.5%: less than 1 day). As the number of infected travellers increases during the overseas outbreak, the delay in onset of a local outbreak through screening declines rapidly; specifically, if infected traveller numbers approach 10 per week, syndromic screening alone can only delay the outbreak by 1 day (75%: less than 1 day).

Similarly, we estimate that in the absence of syndromic air traveller screening, traveller sensitisation can delay the outbreak by 29 days (75%: 12 days, 97.5% 3 days) early in the epidemic with 1 infected traveller per week but delays reduce to 3 days (75%: 1 day, 97.5%: less than 1 day) for 10 infected travellers per week.
For sensitivity analyses, we varied the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation and the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. A 70% reduction in the effective reproduction number through traveller sensitisation followed by rapid case isolation and contact tracing can potentially prevent a local outbreak independent of the number of infected arrivals if the basic reproduction number is smaller than 3.3 (i.e.,
). As traveller sensitisation increases and therefore a greater proportion of simulated ܴ Ԣ values are less than 1, the proportion of simulated delays that are infinitely long (indicating that that specific simulated potential outbreak has been averted) increases (Table S1 ). If traveller sensitisation is assumed to be only 30% effective then the associated outbreak delay for the base case with one infected traveller per week and syndromic screening is 23 days (75%: 12 days, 97.5%: 2 days) ( Table  S2 ). If the number of secondary infections is substantially less disperse, e.g. influenza-like, outbreak delays decrease by about 50%, as the outbreak becomes less reliant on occasional super-spreading events ( Figure S1 ). If, however, the number of secondary infections is slightly more disperse, e.g. SARS-like, then outbreak delays are approximately three-fold longer.
Additional figures in the appendix show the complementary cumulative density functions, focusing on either variation with traveller sensitisation ( Figure S2 ) or arrival rate ( Figure S3 ).

Syndromic screening of air travellers at departure and/or arrival is unlikely to prevent a sufficient proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers from entering a yet unaffected country and thereby prevent a local outbreak. Similarly, sensitisation of travellers from high-risk countries to encourage self-isolation and enable accelerated case detection and contact tracing if indeed infected will likely not be able to halt an outbreak indefinitely, particularly when many infected .

We investigate here how syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation, as well as their combination, may delay an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. We find that while there is only about 1 infected traveller per week, syndromic airport screening can only slightly delay an outbreak (9 days (75%: 4 days, 97.5%: less than 1 day) while traveller sensitisation can have a more pronounced effect be delaying the outbreak by 29 days (75%: 12 days, 97.5%: 3 days). The combination of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation may more substantially delay an outbreak while the number of infected travellers is low (83 days, 75%: 36 days, 97.5% 8 days). The incremental effect of syndromic entry screening is only notable if exit screening is poor. Once the weekly number of infected passengers increases to 10 and above, even with the combination of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation delays of more than a week are unlikely. These results are sensitive to a number of key assumptions: with increasing R 0 , less heterogeneous R 0 or less effect of traveller sensitisation the estimated achievable delay quickly becomes negligible We find a potential role for interventions targeting air-passengers to delay major outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in previously unaffected regions as long as implemented when there are only a few infected travellers per week. We find that syndromic screening on arrival can add to the effect of traveller sensitisation in these early stages of a pandemic. Syndromic screening can also aid to reduce the number of passengers that would eventually self-report and then require resource-intensive follow up, including contact tracing. Therefore, syndromic screening may have an additional role in helping to sustain control efforts for longer. Of note, however, is that syndromic screening at arrival only substantially adds to control efforts if syndromic screening at departure is absent or largely ineffective.
While our findings may encourage implementation of both syndromic screening on entry and traveller sensitisation in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is important to note that these findings are highly sensitive to the underlying base-case assumptions and do not consider the economic implications of large scale air passenger screening and contact tracing. With increasing numbers of infected travellers, a higher number of secondary infections or a lower heterogeneity thereof, or less effective interventions, the achievable delay quickly drops down to a few days of delay. While all of our assumptions include the best knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 to date, there is considerable uncertainty associated with all of these assumptions. For example, we have assumed recently reported heterogeneity in the individual R 0 , however, the reported range of uncertainty includes SARS-like and influenza-like which can drastically alter the results. Some recent, yet not peer-reviewed estimates would suggest more SARS-like or even more overdispersed k which would imply that longer outbreak delays are possible as shown in our sensitivity analysis (14) . We also don't explicitly account for potential asymptomatic transmission. However, we implicitly do so as both the syndromic screening as well as the contact tracing work that informed our estimates accounted for a small proportion of asymptomatic transmitters who we assume similarly transmit but will not be affected by syndromic screening or sensitisation. Notably, we assumed a constant rate of infected travellers. However, this may increase rapidly as the epidemic continues to spread exponentially in China and potentially elsewhere. There is currently little evidence for an exponential increase in infected travellers to Europe as airports in the highest risk regions in China have shut. If .

indeed infected traveller numbers were to increase exponentially numbers would increase from 1 to 10 and 100 per week within about 19 and 38 days respectively (assuming R=2.5 and serial interval of 7.5) and estimated delays would decrease accordingly. Furthermore, the results are predicated on a syndromic screening sensitivity of 86% (6) . When reducing the sensitivity to 70%, as used in other reports (5) , delays reduce by about 20%.
All major airlines have currently suspended flights from mainland China with travel restrictions from Iran, Italy and Korea being recently added. Over the last few weeks, only a few SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers have been reported with symptoms within a few days after their arrival (15). This may suggest that indeed the UK and some parts of Europe are still in a situation where air-traveller targeted interventions may substantially delay major local outbreaks, however, under-reporting of cases is likely and with quickly rising case numbers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Korea and now Iran and Italy as well this situation may change rapidly in the coming days and weeks.
Despite limited evidence that supports its effectiveness (16) , the US has recently banned entry to the US by most foreigners who have recently visited China (17) . In our work, we did not investigate such a drastic interruption of air travel. While a travel ban for entry with history of travel to all high-risk regions would indeed likely further limit the number of infected travellers entering to those who enter by different means, it would also come with substantial economical implications. It does also run the risk that travellers arriving in the US despite their travel history would likely not be reached by targeted sensitisation and/or that they would avoid self-reporting if symptomatic, with potentially dire implications for local spread.
In summary, we find that targeting air-travellers with syndromic screening at exit or entry and sensitisation for signs of symptoms following their arrival may delay a major outbreak in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. In most countries, air-traveller sensitisation and rapid contact tracing protocols are already in place in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We find that syndromic screening at arrival may further enhance such control efforts while the number of infected passengers is less than about 10 per week, but only in the absence of syndromic screening at departure.

1218f278a4f8d83dac14b23c8f698062812ef9d5,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","(2.2 with 90% high density interval 1.4-3.8 (Riou and Althaus, 2020) or 2.7 with a 95% CrI of 2.47-2.86 (Wu et al., 2020) ). Higher estimates have also been reported (Sanche et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . Importantly, R 0 is not a biological constant for a pathogen, but is affected by factors such as environmental conditions and the behaviour of infected individuals. One such environmental factor is climate which modulates transmissibility throughout the year. As a result, many respiratory viruses show clear seasonal variation in prevalence; the most well-known example being seasonal influenza which peaks every winter in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere (Petrova and Russell, 2018) . A similar pattern is seen for the four seasonal human coronaviruses: HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E (hereafter collectively referred to as ""seasonal CoVs"") (Al-Khannaq et al., 2016; Friedman et al., 2018; Galanti et al., 2019; Góes et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2017; Killerby et al., 2018) . These viruses cause respiratory infections which usually are mild and primarily affect young children.
Previous influenza pandemics have swept the world in multiple waves often but not always coinciding with winter months in temperate climates (Amato-Gauci et al., 2011; Taubenberger et al., 2019; Viboud et al., , 2016 . The 1968 The -1970 global influenza pandemic was sparked by a new influenza A/H3N2 virus, with a divergent hemagglutinin protein, which replaced the A/H2N2 virus circulating for 10 years previously . The virus spread rapidly, but the viral dynamics and mortality was not synchronized across countries. While many experienced two more-severe flu seasons in the winters of 1969 and 1970, the US had higher mortality in the first season, while European countries, Japan, and Australia, had higher mortality in the second, and Canada had roughly equal mortality in both .
The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (A/H1N1pdm09) originated in March 2009 in Mexico and spread around the globe within weeks. Only a few European countries saw substantial circulation of H1N1pdm09 in the spring of 2009. Instead the virus showed low prevalence over the summer and pronounced peaks in the following autumn and winter in many countries (Amato-Gauci et al., 2011) . A/H1N1pdm09 has subsequently transitioned into a seasonal pattern causing winter epidemics in temperate climates.
Here we use data on seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs in Sweden and model the impact of this variation on the possible future spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere. We also explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread in temperate and tropical regions and show how variation in epidemiological parameters affects a potential pandemic and the possibility of transitioning to an endemic state.
Data on seasonal variation of HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E diagnoses in respiratory samples was obtained from the routine molecular diagnostics at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. The laboratory provides diagnostic services to six of seven major hospitals and approximately half of outpatient care in the Stockholm county (2.2 million inhabitants). We extracted pseudonymized data on all analyses for the four viruses between Jan 1, 2010 and Dec 31, 2019. The dataset included a total of 52,158 patient samples with 190,257 diagnostic tests, of which 2,084 were positive for any of the coronaviruses (229E = 319; NL63 = 499; OC43 = 604; HKU1 = 355; OC43/HKU1 = 307). Metadata included information about date of sampling and age of patient. In the period of Jan 1, 2010 to Nov 5, 2017, the coronavirus diagnostic was done using in-house assays (Tiveljung-Lindell et al., 2009) . From Nov 6, 2017 to Dec 31, 2019, samples were analysed using the commercial kit Allplex Respiratory Panels (Seegene Inc., Seoul (South Korea)). This commercial kit does not distinguish between HKU1 and OC43, and for this reason positive tests for these two viruses were combined for the entire study period.
The fraction of tests that were positive for the four seasonal CoVs showed a strong and consistent seasonal variation, see Fig. 1 . From December to April approx-imately 2% of tests were positive, while less than 0.2% of tests were positive between July to September, i.e. a 10-fold difference (Fig. 1, right) . The strength of variation of the transmission rate through the year could be of high relevance to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and following years.
We consider simple SIR models (Kermack and McKendrick, 1991) with an additional category E of exposed individuals of the form
where β(t) is the rate at which an infected individual infects a susceptible one, µ is the inverse incubation time, ν is the recovery rate and b is the population turn-over rate.
Depending on the analysis below, we implement several such populations that exchange individuals through migration, for details see Supplementary Methods. Stochasticity is implemented through Poisson resampling of the population once every serial interval µ −1 + (ν + b) −1 . The population turnover b rate is immaterial for a pandemic scenario, but important for our analysis of seasonal CoVs, and should be interpreted as the sum of the birth rate and the rate at which previously immune individuals become susceptible due to immune waning and escape. We review general properties of such model in the Supplementary Materials. Following previous work, we parameterize transmissibility as
where β 0 is the average annual infection rate, ε is the amplitude of seasonal forcing which modulates transmissibility through the year, and θ is the time of peak transmissibility (Chen and Epureanu, 2017; Dushoff et al., 2004) . For simulations of the pandemic, we will add an additional term to β(t) that accounts for infection control measures in heavily affected areas, see Supplementary Materials.
Seasonal CoVs are endemic throughout the world and we therefore expect that viruses are imported throughout the year. We model this import through migration of susceptible individuals with rate m that return exposed .

Humans develop immune responses to CoVs rapidly and subsequent challenge studies show reduced susceptibility and less severe disease for a year (Callow et al., 1990) . Antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 persist for several years (Guo et al., 2020) . This is consistent with the observation that about 50% of all positive samples in our data come from patients older than 10 years with a flat distribution across age groups. In analogy to the attack rate of seasonal influenza, we assume humans suffer from a seasonal CoV infection on average every 10 years (b = 0.1/y). Furthermore, we use R 0 = 2.3, a recovery rate of 0.2days −1 , and an incubation period of 5 days.
With these assumptions, we can solve the model and compare the resulting trajectories to the seasonal variation in prevalence of seasonal CoVs, see Fig. 2 . In Stockholm, seasonal variation of CoVs (especially HKU1/OC43) is very consistent across years (see Fig. S3 ). We therefore fit the SIER model to the average seasonal variation across years by calculating the squared deviation of observed and predicted prevalence relative to their respective mean values. Simulations of the model are compatible with observations in two separate regions of parameter space: If Northern Europe was very isolated with less than 1 in 1,000 susceptible individuals returning with a seasonal CoV infection from abroad each year, weak seasonality of around ε = 0.15 would be sufficient to generate strong variation through the year compatible with observations (Fig. 2 , bottom-left ridge). In this regime, prevalence is oscillating intrinsically with a period that is commensurate with annual seasonal oscillations giving rise to a resonance phenomenon with annual or biennial patterns even for weak seasonal forcing (Chen and Epureanu, 2017; Dushoff et al., 2004) .
If the rate of import of seasonal CoV infections is higher, imports dampen the resonance and much stronger seasonality, with values between ε = 0.3 and 0.7, is required to fit the observations (Fig. 2 , top-right-and-center ridge). In this regime, seasonal variation in transmissibility modulates the size of micro-outbreaks triggered by imported cases in a mostly immune population.
These two scenarios differ slightly in the time of year at which peak transmissibility θ occurs: When transmission is mostly local and seasonality is amplified by .

In the second scenario with high connectivity, θ needs to be in December-January coinciding with the peak in prevalence. Given that most countries are highly connected, we focus here on exploring the high-import and strong seasonal forcing scenario. This scenario, with maximal β in mid-winter, is also more compatible with climate variation around the year. The qualitative behavior of the fit is robust to uncertainty in R 0 and the frequency of reinfection b.
The analysis of seasonal CoV prevalence patterns allowed us to constrain parameter ranges and explore different scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the globe, in particular in temperate climates like Northern Europe.
Here we explore scenarios where temperate regions have a seasonal forcing of between ε = 0.3 and 0.7 and migration rates of 0.01/year. Early estimates suggest an incubation time of about 5 days and an average serial interval of 7-8 days (Wu et al., 2020) . Our model uses an average incubation time of 5 days (Backer et al., 2020) and an infectious period of 5 days.
To match the R 0 estimates for the early outbreak with our parameterization of transmissibility in Eq. 2 we need to account for the fact that December/January are winter months in Hubei and peak transmissibility in Hubei likely corresponds to θ ≈ 0 (0 being the beginning of the year, so a θ in December/January). An R 0 ≈ 3 in winter in Hubei and a seasonal forcing of ε = 0.4 implies an annual average R 0 = β 0 /ν = 2.2. This reasoning leads to our parameter choice of β 0 = 158/year, ν = 72/year, θ = 0. We assume the outbreak started at t = 2019.8 in Hubei with one infected individual and use N = 6 × 10 7 as population size. To incorporate infection control measures, transmissibility is reduced by 50% once prevalence reached 3% (third order Hill-function, see Supplemental Material). Introductions to a location like Northern Europe with ε = 0.5 (i.e. slightly stronger seasonal forcing then Hubei) are assumed to happen at a rate of 0.01 per year for each infected individual elsewhere. The simulation of the SIER model in different regions is deterministic, but migration is implemented stochastically by Poisson resampling of the average number of migrating individuals. Fig. 3 shows simulated trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the temperate Northern Hemisphere assuming the outbreak started in Hubei early December 2019. Depending whether the peak transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in the northern temperate zone is in November, January, or March, the simulation predicts a main peak in the first half of 2020, a main peak in winter 2020/2021, or two similarly sized peaks.
To explore possible scenarios more systematically, we ran such simulations for a range of values for R 0 and peak transmissibility θ and recorded whether we observe and early peak, a late peak, or a two peaks. The right panel of Fig. 3 shows the ratio of the height of these peaks for different values. Rapid growth (high R 0 ) and late transmission peaks result in a large peak in the first half 2020, while lower R 0 and transmission peaks in early winter favor a large secondary peak. These two scenarios are separated by a band of parameter values that give rise to two pandemic waves in the winters of 2020 and 2021 in the Northern Hemisphere. Individual trajectories for a variety of parameter combinations are given in Fig. S4 . The qualitative behavior is robust to model perturbations and parameter variation as long as seasonal forcing is strong. With weak forcing (ε = 0.15), the model predicts a single peak for most combinations of R 0 and migration rates (see Fig. S5 ).
The uncertainty in parameter values and the potential impact of infection control measures imply that all scenarios are plausible and should be considered when developing pandemic prevention and containment strategies.
In absence of control measures, outbreaks initially grow exponentially within well-mixed communities, and at a certain rate the virus will be carried to other regions and potentially seed new outbreaks. Such export to new locations is initially unlikely, but becomes next to certain once the outbreak size exceeds the inverse probability that a given individual migrates while infected. We have witnessed such rapid dispersal to SARS-CoV-2 to many countries across the globe during January and February 2020.
Every location has a different socio-economic profile such that the growth rate of the epidemic (and hence R 0 ) might differ. The superposition of many such subpopulations with a range of R 0 values and seasonal variation in transmission will result in dynamics that are qualitatively different from a single population SIR model. In particular, such variation result in a pandemic spread out over 2 years before the virus possibly becomes endemic. Fig. 4 shows the result of such a simulation of 1,000 populations. Populations were divided between northern temperate (50%), southern temperate (10%), and tropical (40%) and assigned parameters as follows:
• R 0 was drawn from a normal distribution with mean 2.2 (see Supplementary Fig. 7 for R 0 = 1.5 and 3.0) and standard deviation 0.5.
• Seasonal forcing ε was drawn from a uniform distribution between 0.25 and 0.75 for temperate regions, . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 between 0 and 0.2 for tropical regions.
• Peak transmissibility θ of temperate regions was drawn from normal distributions with standard deviation 0.1 and peak at 0 for northern regions and 0.5 for southern regions. θ for tropical regions was chosen uniformly from between 0 and 1.
• Population sizes were drawn from a log-normal distribution with σ = 1 and a mean such that all populations sum to 7.6 billion.
• Migration rates were sampled from a log-normal distribution with σ = 1 and a mean of 0.01.
For Hubei, we use the same parameters as described in section IV. The variation in R 0 and migration rate result in a super-position of fast and slow epidemics seeded at different times. The initial phase is dominated by fast epidemics driving rapid dispersal, in particular in the tropics, while slow epidemics dominate later in 2020 and 2021. With the parameter setting used in Fig. 4 , the Northern temperate regions see most circulation in winter 2020/2021. In accordance with Fig. 3 , this peak shifts more towards early 2020 for higher R 0 , see Supplementary Fig. 7 .
After several years, SARS-CoV-2 could become a seasonal CoV with characteristic winter outbreaks as shown in Fig. 1 . Such a scenario is demonstrated in Fig. 5 where a simulation similar to the one shown in Fig. 4 is run for 12 years, with the added assumption that after infection an individual become susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 again at a rate of 0.1 per year as we assumed for seasonal CoV above. After a pronounced low in 2020-2024, prevalence recovers and settles into a seasonal pattern, similar to that of the four existing seasonal CoVs.
We report on the possible influence of seasonal variation on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Northern Hemisphere, in a pandemic scenario. We find that seasonal variation in transmissibility has the potential to modulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a wide range of possible outcomes that need to be taken into account when interpreting case counts and projecting the outbreak dynamics. The onset of spring and summer could, for example, give the impression that SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully contained, only for infections to increase again in 2020-2021 winter season. Even in Hubei virus circulation might decrease due to containment measures and the arrival of spring but might increase again towards the end of the year. Whether a pandemic in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere would peak early in 2020, late in 2020, or show multiple waves as H1N1pdm did in 2009, depends on the timing of peak transmissibility and the rate of spread (R 0 and serial interval).

is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 If previously infected individuals can be reinfected after some time, as for example by seasonal influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 could develop into a seasonal CoV that returns every winter. This would typically happen at much lower prevalence than peak pandemic levels. These simulations assume reinfection on average every 10 years.
pandemic could unfold, not as a prediction of any particular scenario. The results we present are critically dependent on the assumptions i) that the outbreak will develop into a pandemic, ii) that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonal variability of sufficient strength (range ε = 0.3 to 0.7), and iii) that parameters like R 0 estimated from the early phase of the outbreak are comparable in other populations. These assumptions are not implausible but not certain: cases of SARS-CoV-2 has been in several countries in Asia apart from China, as well as in Europe, Africa, North America, and Australia (WHO Emergency Committee, 2020b), and mild or asymptomatic cases make detection and thus prevention of spread by isolation challenging, e.g. airport screening as a preventive measure is unlikely to prevent spread and local seeding (Quilty et al., 2020) . Person-to-person transmission of the virus has been documented in several countries outside of China, including large outbreaks in Iran, South Korea, and Italy (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2020). It is likely that not all exported cases have been detected, and some may have seeded outbreaks outside of China that have yet to be detected.
The seasonal CoVs show a strong and consistent seasonal variation, and modeling suggests that this requires strong variation in transmissibility throughout the year. It should be noted, however, that SARS-CoV-2 does seem to transmit in tropical climates like Singapore, and so winter is not a necessary condition of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Furthermore, our models are compatible with work by Luo et al. (2020) showing that recent trends in different regions across East-Asia imply that seasonality alone is unlikely to end SARS-CoV-2 spread. Precise values for the underlying model parameters and the effect of infection control measures are currently unavailable. For this reason we explored a range of parameter values to assess the robustness of the results to model assumptions.

The implications of our work are that: 1) reductions in prevalence need not be attributable to successful interventions, but could be due to seasonal variation in transmissibility, 2) sub-population dynamics can differ greatly, meaning that case count trajectories in one country should be used cautiously to inform projections in a second country, even in the same climate zone, 3) seasonal variation might slow down a pandemic and thereby provide a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems world-wide by scaling up capacity for care and diagnostics, and potentially through rapid development of antivirals and vaccine, and 4) after several years SARS-CoV-2 could develop into an endemic seasonal CoV similar to the transition of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic influenza virus into a seasonal influenza virus.
The overall impact of a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic depends critically on the case fatality ratio (CFR), which we have not modelled here. At present, uncertainty in the CFR is high due to likely over-representation of severe cases in the statistics and a delay between diagnosis and recovery/death (Battegay et al., 2020) . Even with this unknown, seasonal variation in transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and underlying differences in migration, introduction times, and attack rate should thus be taken into account when monitoring and projecting global transmission, planning further surveillance of the epidemic, and developing pandemic prevention and containment strategies.

123db7cdec9fc63aa09782ea9f4267603be8f74d,"Advanced biomaterials provide versatile ways to spatially and temporally control immune cell activity, potentially enhancing their therapeutic potency and safety. Precise cell modulation demands multi-modal display of functional proteins with controlled densities on biomaterials. Here, we develop an artificial immune cell engager (AICE) platform -biodegradable particles onto which multiple proteins are densely loaded with ratiometric control via short nucleic acid tethers. We demonstrate the impact of AICE with varying ratios of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies on ex vivo expansion of human primary T cells. We also show that AICE can be used to control the activity of engineered T cells in vivo. AICE injected intratumorally can provide a local priming signal for systemically administered AND-gate chimeric antigen receptor T cells, driving local tumor clearance while sparing uninjected tumors that model potentially cross-reactive healthy tissues. This modularly functionalized biomaterial thus provides a flexible platform to achieve sophisticated control over cell-based immunotherapies.
Functionalized biomaterials can work synergistically with natural or engineered immune cells for cancer immunotherapy 1-15 . Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cells has shown success and clinical approval for the treatment of B cell cancers 16 . However, for CAR T cells to fulfill their promising potential, particularly for targeting solid tumors 17, 18 , important challenges must be overcome to improve both efficacy 17-20 and safety 21-24 .

The clinical application of this strategy, however, requires systematic identification of tumor specific antigen combinations and would also benefit from better control of cell activity 27, 29 .
Biomaterials functionalized with modulatory biomolecules at pre-specified densities have been shown to communicate with and control therapeutic immune cells both ex vivo and in vivo [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . For example, synthetic materials have been functionalized with agonistic antibodies for CD3 and CD28 to drive ex vivo T cell expansion 25, 26 .
However, biodegradable materials 25 with optimized material structure/composition and controlled surface moiety loading can provide unique opportunities to improve the ease of manufacturing and the quantity and quality of T cells produced. There is also a growing interest in the use of biomaterials for local modulation of engineered T cell activity in vivo during the course of treatment 1 .
Nonetheless, the use of biomaterials to precisely modulate immune cells still faces key challenges. There is a need for robust chemical conjugation strategies to surfacefunctionalize biodegradable materials with multiple signals (e.g. proteins/antibodies) at high densities and precisely controlled ratios [30] [31] [32] [33] . PEG (polyethylene glycol) is commonly used as a linker or scaffold for the surface conjugation of biomolecules 31 , but this method is limited by the inefficient presentation of functional groups for attaching biomolecules due to PEG's flexibility 34 . Synthetic short oligonucleotidesnatural polymers with controllable sequence and structure -have been used as surface scaffolds on metallic particles for siRNA delivery 34-37 , but have yet to be fully utilized for modular payload assembly on biodegradable materials.
In this work, we developed short synthetic DNA scaffolds for the efficient and versatile functionalization of proteins or antibodies on the surface of biodegradable particles (Fig. 1a) . A series of optimization studies were carried out to achieve maximum loading density, ratiometric control of moiety loading, adaptability to different particle size/composition, and feasibility for in vivo use. Micron-sized artificial immune cell engagers (AICE) were made from biocompatible poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) polymer 38 (Fig. 1a) . We demonstrated that: i) we can load a range of immune modulators (e.g. anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and IL-2) on AICE at controlled ratios and densities; ii) the ratiometric control of costimulatory ligands is essential for optimal ex vivo T cell activation and expansion with higher yield and less exhaustion; iii) we can locally administer antigen-presenting AICE to control ANDgate CAR-T cell activation and tumor clearance in vivo (Fig. 1a) . This modular materials-based strategy can provide versatile and precise synthetic control of natural or engineered immune cells for cancer immunotherapy 1, 12, 29 .
Synthetic short DNA strands were immobilized on the surface of polymeric particles to create an adaptable scaffold for loading bioactive molecules. The emulsion protocol of particle synthesis 38 was modified to add conjugated polymer-DNA amphiphilic molecules during the fabrication process such that the hydrophilic DNA segment distributes around the hydrophobic core upon sonication (Fig. 1b) . Polymer-DNA molecules were first synthesized through a conjugation of thiol-modified DNA to Maleimide (Mal)-modified polymer. We optimized the polymer, DNA length, solvent, and reaction conditions to generate optimal polymer-DNA molecules to form stable PLGA (50:50, MW 38-54k, Sigma) particles with dense DNA scaffolds (Fig. All rights reserved.

PLGA10k-PEG5k-Mal was identified as an important polymer-DNA component to ultimately form microparticles of the desired size (1-2 μm in diameter), so we kept the polymer constant while varying the excess of DNA input during the conjugation reaction and observed an increase in polymer coupling efficiency (Fig. 1c) .
The direct incorporation of polymer-DNA reaction mixtures with different DNA:polymer ratios into the particle fabrication protocol yielded a significant increase of surface payload-attachable DNA scaffold density, as determined by a fluorescence-based hybridization analysis (Fig. 1d) . Strikingly, the highest average surface loading density on particles (~5 million DNA duplexes per particle, Fig.   Supplementary 1e-g) was roughly analogous to the theoretical limit (at ~4 million by footprint calculation, based on ~2 nm diameter of DNA duplex) of a spherical particle with a 2 μm diameter. In particular, this hybridization-guided loading was about 27fold more efficient than that from the traditional method 33 , in which thiol-modified DNA molecules were conjugated to surface-exposed Mal groups after particle fabrication using equal input amount of PLGA10k-PEG5k-Mal (Fig. 1d) . The hybridization-guided biomolecule assembly protocol was optimized to a 30-minute incubation at 37 o C ( Fig. Supplementary 1h) , and functionalized particles can be further lyophilized for storage and transportation (Fig. Supplementary 1i) .
To accommodate diverse applications from intracellular payload delivery to extracellular signal transduction, DNA-scaffolded particles can be synthesized at various sizes and also loaded with biomolecules in their core. Particle size can be controlled by tuning key emulsion parameters ( Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1j ).
We observed a concave shape on one side for some larger particles (~2 μm in diameter) but not for smaller particles (~500 nm) (Fig. 1f) possibly due to the high All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Additionally, we showed that the core of these DNA-scaffolded microparticles could also be loaded with biomolecules including oligonucleotides and peptides through a double-emulsion protocol ( Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1k ). This strategy of fabricating DNA-scaffolded particles was also successfully replicated using other polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA) (Fig. 1h and Fig. Supplementary 1l,m) .
Biomolecules can be loaded on the surface of DNA-scaffolded particles using one of two strategies: a) linking functional groups of the scaffolds to biomolecules through the surface step-by-step conjugation via a bifunctional linker; and b) through the direct hybridization of complementary DNA-biomolecule conjugates to the scaffold ( Fig. 2a) . In the case of a fluorescently labeled human IgG, the surface conjugation strategy resulted in saturated protein loading even with increased densities of available DNA linkers on surface (Fig 2b, Fig 1d and Fig. Supplementary 2a) . In contrast, the hybridization-guided assembly strategy showed a dramatically higher level of IgG loading for particles with denser DNA linkers, and the increase in IgG loading corresponded to the scaffold density (Fig. 2b) . The highest level of IgG loading achieved (at ~0.6 million per particle) was again comparable to the theoretical footprint limit of a spherical particle at 2 μm in diameter (~0.64 million per particle, based on ~5 nm diameter of IgG) (Fig. 2b) . For generating DNA-antibody conjugates with the minimum damage to the antibody activity, different chemistries ( Fig.   Supplementary 2b,c) were attempted and the ""TCEP"" strategy 6 was identified as optimal, whereby the antibody hinge region was selectively reduced to expose the thiol group for 3'NH 2 -modified complimentary DNA to attach through a MAL-dPEG4-NHS linker (Quanta Biodesign).

For DNA tethering of proteins other than antibodies, other options are available to yield products with intact activity (Fig.   Supplementary 2d,e) .
Another advantageous feature of using DNA as a surface scaffold is that the uniqueness of nucleotide sequences enables the independent control of loading multiple cargos on the same material surface (Fig 2d) . Polymer-DNA conjugates with three distinct DNA sequences (namely R, G, and B strand) that do not anneal with each other (Fig. Supplementary 2f) were synthesized and incorporated into particle emulsion with reaction mixtures at different ratios (3:1:1, 1:1:1 and 1:1:3). After surface hybridization with a mixture of their respective dye-labeled complementary strands (Fig. 2d) , we found that the ratios of hybridized DNA scaffolds of different sequences on PLGA microparticles were consistent with the polymer-DNA conjugate input, evidenced by both confocal fluorescence imaging (Fig. 2e) and a fluorescencebased quantification assay (Fig. 2f) . The ratiometric control of dye-labeled DNA strand loading was equally efficient for PLA microparticles (Fig. Supplementary   2g ,h). Based on this, we co-loaded three different proteins (GFP and two antibodies), each individually attached with one of the three complementary DNA strands, onto PLGA microparticles with varying ratios of the DNA surface scaffold sequences above. Similar distribution of each protein cargo compared with the scaffold population was observed (Fig. 2g) , demonstrating the robust ratiometric control of surface protein loading using this particle synthesis strategy.
To enable in vivo use, we explored the stability of the DNA scaffolds on the surface of PLGA microparticles in the presence of a large excess of DNase. (Fig. 2h) . We All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

This suggests that the surface-loaded proteins are able to protect the DNA scaffolds. In human serum, we did not observe as significant DNA degradation for the naked particles due to the lower DNase concentration in serum than used in Fig.2i ; however, the degree of DNA degradation similarly decreased as surface payload proteins were attached (Fig. 2j) .
Macrophage uptake is a major obstacle 39 for particle-based drug delivery in vivo, therefore we incorporated a CD47-mimic ""self""-peptide 40 on PLGA microparticles ( Fig. 2k) . Fluorescein-labeled PLGA microparticles with and without surface-loaded ""self""-peptide were co-incubated with a mouse macrophage line J774A.1 in vitro. The particle uptake assay showed that the ""self""-peptide decoration significantly reduced the uptake of particles by macrophages ( Fig. 2k and Supplementary Fig 2i,j) . This ""self""-peptide functionalization provides a possible strategy to reduce the clearance of particles in vivo.
Given the ability to synthesize particles with ratiometric control of multiple surface cargos, we loaded anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies on AICE (PLGA microparticles) at varying ratios from 1:5 to 5:1. Anti-CD3/CD28 AICE were compared to commercial anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads at the same particle to cell ratio for the ability to expand human primary T cells with minimized differentiation and exhaustion (Fig. 3a) . Functionalized AICE activated T cells (Fig. 3b) and yielded higher or equivalent T cell expansion compared to Dynabeads expansion across three All rights reserved.

Although there were large donor-to-donor differences (also observed for Dynabeads), we observed a linear increase of cell yield from AICE-[1:5, anti-CD3:anti-CD28] to AICE-[3:1] for both CD4+ and CD8+ cells at day 14 ( Fig. 3c and Fig. Supplementary 3a) . The phenotype of expanded T cells at day 14 was then explored by measuring expression of CD45RA and CCR7 surface markers (Fig. 3e) . Interestingly, the population distribution of the 4 differentiation states (naïve, central memory [CM], effector memory [EM] and effector memory RA
[EMRA]), displayed a pattern ( Fig. 3f and Fig. Supplementary 3b) corresponding to the cell expansion trend among AICE with different anti-CD3 to anti-CD28 ratios ( Fig. 3c) . Through staining for T cell exhaustion markers LAG-3, PD-1 and TIM-3, we found that the population of exhausted cells at the optimal condition AICE- [3:1] was generally less than those activated by Dynabeads among the three donors ( Fig.   Supplementary 3c,d) . Taken together, the data demonstrates that the surface ratio control of functional moieties on synthetic materials is important for the quantity and phenotype of cells yielded from ex vivo T cell expansion.
As an alternative to the standard protocol of supplementing free IL-2 in the media for ex vivo T cell culture 25 , we loaded IL-2 on AICE through the surface presentation via its antibody clone #5355 (Fig. Supplementary 3e) . This particular anti-IL-2 antibody was engineered to facilitate the binding of IL-2 to its β and γ receptor on T cells thus promoting the proliferation of non-Treg T cells 41 (Fig. 3g and Fig.   Supplementary 3f ). Using the optimal condition of AICE[3:1] (anti-CD3:anti-CD28) determined above, we compared primary T cell expansion by supplementing equal amount of free IL-2 versus surface bound IL-2 ( Fig. Supplementary 3e) . Surface IL-2 loading enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell expansion, and particularly improved expansion of CD4+ primary T cells after day 8 (Fig. 3h,i and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/587105 doi: bioRxiv preprint 3a,g). Although with higher level of cell yield, the populations of LAG-3 and PD-1 positive CD4+ T cells still decreased in the two tested donors (Fig. Supplementary   3h ), demonstrating the advantages of AICE-surface presentation of IL-2 for ex vivo expansion.
We also explored the use of AICE coated with an orthogonal antigen (GFP) to prime AND-gate CAR-T cell tumor recognition circuits, with the goal of preventing ""ontarget off-tumor"" toxicity by restricting cell killing to tumors locally-injected with AICE microparticles (Fig 4a) . These AND-gate T cells utilize a modular synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor with an extracellular domain to recognize a target antigen, and an intracellular transcriptional activator (TF) domain to control expression of a CAR targeting a second antigen 28 . Killing is only induced when both antigens are presented to T cells, with one activating the synNotch receptor to release the TF domain for CAR expression and the other activating CAR-mediated cytotoxicity 28 .
Herein, human primary T cells were transduced with a gene encoding a constitutivelyexpressed synNotch receptor with an extracellular anti-GFP nanobody and an intracellular Gal4DBD-VP64 synthetic transcription factor (TF) domain, together with a TF-inducible CAR gene targeting HER2 (human epithelial growth factor receptor 2) 28 (Fig. 4a) . In this system, T cells should only express the anti-HER2 CAR and kill HER2 positive target cells after priming via the anti-GFP synNotch binding AICE-presented GFP.
Human primary CD8+ T cells engineered with the above circuit were co-cultured for 24 hours with single antigen target cells (human melanoma cell line A375 with HER2 overexpressed) in the presence or absence of GFP+ AICE microparticles.

For both CD4+ and CD8+ engineered primary T cells, we observed selective secretion of cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ, respectively) after 48 hours of co-culture with both HER2+ A375 cells and GFP+ AICE (Fig. 4c) . Increasing AICE GFP density led to elevated levels of cytokine secretion (Fig. 4c, Fig. Supplementary 4a) . Noticeably, T cells secreted significantly more cytokines with AICE presenting synNotch-priming GFP than with target cells presenting both synNotch and CAR antigens (A375 with GFP and HER2 co-expressed) (Fig. Supplementary 4b) .
Human primary CD8+ T cells containing the same circuit as above also showed AND-gate killing behavior, selectively killing HER2+ A375 cells in the presence of GFP+ AICE microparticles. Co-incubation of GFP+ AICE and CD8+ human primary T cells led to some killing of co-cultured HER2+ A375 cells (with 1:1 ratio) at 24 hours (Fig. 4d,e) , and the killing became more apparent after 48 hours with higher densities of priming signals on AICE ( Fig. 4f and Fig. Supplementary 4c-f ). In contrast, initial attempts using particles synthesized by traditional conjugation chemistry and with far lower GFP density failed to activate AND-gate CAR-T cells, likely due to the inadequate ligand density for robust synNotch activation. As a demonstration of adaptability for translational use, a synthetic short peptide (PNE peptide) computationally predicted to be non-immunogenic 42 was engineered on AICE and co-incubated with its corresponding anti-PNE synNotch/anti-HER2 CAR CD8+ T cells and HER2+ target cells, and killing was significantly enhanced by PNE+ AICE addition (Fig. Supplementary 4g) .

To determine the feasibility of using local particle injections to send spatially-defined signals to therapeutic cells in vivo, we first monitored the distribution of intratumorally-injected AICE microparticles. We labeled surface DNA and polymer core with two distinct infrared dyes (Quasar705 and IR800CW respectively, We hypothesized that AICE made of GFP decorated PLGA microparticles could be injected intratumorally as a local activator for systemically administered anti-GFP synNotch/anti-HER2 CAR T cells (Fig. 5c) . NSG mice were implanted subcutaneously with the same HER2-overexpressed K562 xenograft tumors in bilateral flanks as a model for a tumor and healthy tissue both expressing the CAR antigen.

The size of AICE-injected ipsilateral tumors decreased over time, in contrast to the contralateral tumors within the same mice without AICE injection and tumors in mice injected with AICE plus untransduced primary T cells ( Fig. 5d-g) . We also performed fluorescence microscopy on fixed tumor samples of mice sacrificed at an early timepoint and observed selective T cell infiltration in the AICE-injected tumor ( Fig.   5h and Supplementary 5f). These results demonstrate that AICE can provide a spatially controlled signal in vivo for the local activation of synNotch CAR-T cells and induction of precision tumor clearance with limited risk of cross-reaction against healthy tissues.
In this work, we demonstrate a unique platform using synthetic short DNA oligonucleotides as surface scaffolds on biodegradable materials for the precise and controlled loading of multiple biomolecules at specific ratio and density. These advanced biomaterials possess the ability to regulate immune cells in the context of ex vivo and in vivo activation of both natural and engineered T cells. Through this highly modular platform, biocompatible materials can be employed as substrates for a wide spectrum of modulatory biomolecules, including cytokines 5 , antigens 10 , checkpoint inhibitors 43 , agonistic or antagonistic antibodies 44 , adjuvants 9, 11 , etc., to regulate the local environment and enhance the efficacy of immune cells in cancer immunotherapy 8 . Synthetic materials with tunable properties can enhance the pharmacokinetics of regulatory biomolecules in vivo 1, 6, 8 , and sometimes provide a necessary surface substrate for biomolecules to activate the cognate cell signaling 10, 25, 28 . Biomaterials fabricated with controlled size, shape, and composition -for example, microspheres, nanowires, and porous scaffolds -can also serve as a local adjuvant 2, 3, All rights reserved.

This can make a particular difference for solid tumor treatment, where functionalized biomaterials could be administered locally or engrafted post-surgery 3, 17, 45 .
Here we explored using a natural polymer, DNA, as the surface scaffold for loading biomolecules onto particles. We demonstrated, through near surface-saturated biomolecule loading and precise ratiometric control of moiety loading, that hybridization-based thermodynamics can overcome limitations of traditional surface conjugation such as reduced efficiency of multi-step reactions, steric hindrance, and decay of functional groups. The increased loading density of surface biomolecules was found to be necessary to make particles capable of presenting antigens to robustly activate synNotch receptors in primary human T cells, and may also significantly enhance immune cell signaling where ligand clustering is required 10, 46 . We also show the versatility of this strategy by fabricating particles of different sizes, as well as compositions with different degradation profiles. This method can be applied to other formats of biomaterial functionalization (e.g. scaffolds and nonspherical particles)
where fragile biomolecules need to be presented at a material interface.
The densely-packed surface DNA scaffolds and the payload attachments protected DNA linkers from enzymatic degradation, which shows great promise for in vivo use.
This organized packing of the particle surface with a protein corona may also minimize interactions with serum proteins to prevent macrophage clearance 47 . Furthermore, particle uptake by macrophages can be attenuated through the immobilization of a CD47 mimic ""self""-peptide 40 . Safety concerns about immunogenicity from the DNA scaffolds can be addressed through optimization of sequences and special modifications 48 . All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The precise ratio of agonistic antibodies (anti-CD3 and anti-CD28) for T cell activation on AICE impacts ex vivo T expansion efficiency, as well as T cell differentiation and exhaustion phenotypes. The ability to accurately control the ratio of multi-cargo particle loading should enable identification of novel, precise combinations of modulatory signals that lead to diversified and improved T cell behavior. The use of biodegradable materials also omits the need for synthetic material removal prior to cell implantation. Cumulatively, these properties suggest that AICE could aid in manufacturing for ACT by improving the ease-of-production and fine-tuning the yield and phenotype of the therapeutic cell product.
We and other groups have developed strategies to engineer T cells with multiple receptors to detect combinations of antigens [27] [28] [29] . All prior combinatorial antigen recognition systems have targeted combinations of antigens expressed on tumor cells and/or tumor-related cells 27, 29 . Here, we demonstrate a method to engineer T cells to recognize combinations of endogenous and orthogonal antigens presented by tumor cells and biocompatible materials, respectively. By incorporating material-presented antigen into combinatorial recognition circuits, we enable real-time controlled local activation of these circuits that can be achieved through dynamic particle dosing in living organisms/patients. Local injection of our particles serves to safely control receptor activation and downstream behavior of therapeutic cells in vivo. We demonstrated that synNotch-based combinatorial antigen recognition circuits can incorporate material-presented antigen sensing, and it is likely that other combinatorial antigen recognition systems, for example, chimeric costimulatory receptors (CCRs) 49 in AND-gates or inhibitory CARs (iCARs) 50 in NOT-gates, can as well.

We believe that the true promise of the AICE platform will be realized by using particles to present multiple signals within the tumor microenvironment. AICE particles could kick-start tumor killing by triggering CAR expression by synNotch-CAR T cells. T cell activity within the tumor could be further augmented by cofunctionalization of AICE particles with additional cargos that go beyond a synNotch ligand, for instance, a costimulatory ligand and a checkpoint inhibitor tailored to circumvent the specific immune evasion mechanisms of a particular tumor type 17, 45 .
Ultimately, it would be ideal to utilize intratumoral injection of AICE particles to initiate antigen-specific local immunity that could be converted into antigen spreading and systemic immunity by incorporating other cues onto/into the particles to stimulate innate immunity 18 .

12920263b2846c61d6f2b6105189367a8ff1bc39,"Reproductive success in the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) was measured using a diallel-mating scheme. Over a 48-month period we generated 4,448 litters, and 24,782 weaned pups were used across 16 different published experiments. We identified factors that affect the average litter size in a cross by estimating the overall contribution of parent-of-origin, heterosis, inbred, and epistatic effects using a Bayesian zero-truncated overdispersed Poisson mixed model. The phenotypic variance of litter size has a substantial contribution (79%) from unexplained and environmental sources, but no detectable effect of seasonality. Most of the explained variance was due to additive effects (9.2%) and parental sex (maternal vs paternal strain; 5.8%), with epistasis accounting for 3.4%. Within the parental effects, the effect of the dam's strain explained more than the sire's strain (13.2% vs. 1.8%), and the dam's strain effects account for 74.2% of total variation explained. Dams from strains C57BL/6J and NOD/ShiLtJ increased the expected litter size by a mean of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, whereas dams from strains WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and CAST/EiJ reduced expected litter size by a mean of 1.51, 0.81, and 0.90 pups. Finally, there was no strong evidence for strain-specific effects on sex ratio distortion. Overall, these results demonstrate that strains vary substantially in their reproductive ability depending on their genetic background and that litter size is largely determined by dam.strain rather than sire.strain effects, as expected. This analysis adds to our understanding of factors that influence litter size in mammals, and also helps to explain breeding successes and failures in the extinct lines and surviving CC strains. KEYWORDS F1 cross additive heritability fertility BayesDiallel zero-truncated Poisson variance projection","A critical part of fitness is optimizing the balance between numbers of offspring, offspring body size, and reproductive timing, leading to strong selection for these traits (Smith and Fretwell 1974; Beauchamp and Kacelnik 1990) . Fundamental fitness traits, like litter size (i.e., the number of pups born per litter), should have low contributions of genetic variance due to rapid fixation of alleles that increase fitness (Mousseau and Roff 1987; Price and Schluter 1991; Merilä and Sheldon 1999; Stirling et al. 2002; Peripato et al. 2004) . Estimates of litter size heritability vary from 5% to 20% in mouse, rabbit, and porcine populations (Falconer 1960; Avalos and Smith 1987; Falconer and Mackay 1996; Johnson et al. 1999; Garcıa and Baselga 2002; Peripato et al. 2004; Gutiérrez et al. 2006) leading to the majority of variation in litter size being non-heritable. Nonheritable factors include seasonality, food availability, paternal and maternal effects, dominance and epistasis, as well as unknown factors. Additionally, sexual conflict over parental investment may exist between females and males, and this in turn could affect litter size (Trivers 1974; Hager and Johnstone 2003) . These factors make it difficult to obtain clear measurements of litter size in wild populations. A controlled laboratory environment is therefore necessary to measure genetic effects of litter size (Jinks and Broadhurst 1963; Roberts 1960; Bandy and Eisen 1984; Hoornbeek 1968; Peripato et al. 2004; Gutiérrez et al. 2006; Varona and Sorensen 2014) .
The Collaborative Cross (CC) and its eight founder strains are an important resource for studying complex traits, establishing mouse models for human disease, and understanding the mouse Diversity Outbred (DO), which originated from the CC (Ferris et al. 2013; Chesler 2014; Rogala et al. 2014; Rasmussen et al. 2014; Gralinski et al. 2015 Gralinski et al. , 2017 Schoenrock et al. 2017; Maurizio et al. 2018) . The CC resource and its founder strains can also be used to study reproductive ability, which is especially interesting because this population has an established record both of breeding successes and of failures. For example, litter size in the early CC lines shows a steady decline over the first six generations of inbreeding (Philip et al. 2011 ). In addition, nearly 95% of all CC lines have become extinct, primarily due to subspecific genomic incompatibilities (Shorter et al. 2017) . Although standard reproductive phenotypes have been measured, mostly in male CC founders (Odet et al. 2015) , the genetic and non-genetic control over CC breeding success has never been thoroughly characterized, and is likely to contain vital information that may be used to improve CC breeding in the future.
Given the growing popularity of the CC as a community resource, we investigated reproductive ability across the eight founders of the CC to better understand the genetic and nongenetic factors that affect their fertility and breeding. Using an 8⇥8 diallel design, we measured weaned litter sizes from over 4400 litters arising from 62 crosses across four years of breeding. Adapting a recently developed statistical model of diallel effects (Lenarcic et al. 2012) , we quantified both the genetic contributions that shape litter size and the contributions of several environmental factors. Our results provide a detailed account of breeding patterns across and between the eight founders. This experiment also informs us about genetic combinations that are highly or marginally productive in the CC, helping us to better understand CC fertility problems and line extinction.
The mouse inbred strains used in these experiments are the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) (Collaborative The number of litters observed per cross is given by the integers, with the largest sample sizes, along the diagonal, corresponding to the production of inbred parental strains. Column and row sums are given along the bottom row and rightmost column, respectively. A total of 4,448 litters were evaluated for this analysis, resulting in a total of 24,782 weaned pups. The shading within each box corresponds to the average number of weaned pups per litter in each cross, with averages ranging from 3.6 to 9.1 pups per litter. Litters for which no pups survived until weaning were not included in our analysis. The symbol ""⇥"" is used to indicate incompatible crosses that do not produce any litters.
Cross Consortium 2012). The founders of the CC include five classical strains, A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129S1), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/HlLtJ (NZO), and three wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). Mice originated from a colony maintained by Gary Churchill at Jackson Laboratory, and were transferred to the FMPV lab at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 2008. The original colony also produced most of the G1 breeders that populated the inbred funnels at ORNL, TAU and Geniad (Srivastava et al. 2017 
Testing environmental interactions. Significant environmental interactions were determined using ANOVA, using JMP 12 software (JMP®, Version 12. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989 -2007 . Tested effects included a season effect (average weaned litter size in each month over every year), non-seasonal factors using a year-bymonth effect (average weaned litter size for all months across all years), and a litter order effect (average weaned litter size in each subsequent dam litter). We performed the ANOVA on litter size counts from the eight inbred matings only, because of their robust sample sizes throughout the four years of breeding.
To estimate the overall contributions of heritable factors affecting litter size in our population, we adapted a previously published linear mixed model, Bayes-Diallel (Lenarcic et al. 2012) , which performs this estimation for continuous phenotypes, to the setting of a discrete count-based phenotype. To do this we reimplemented the BayesDiallel Gibbs sampler as a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using the R software package MCMCglmm (Hadfield 2010) . Let y i be the number of pups born to litter i, where y i 2 N + , and denote the corresponding pair of parental strains, namely maternal strain j and paternal strain k, using the notation {jk}[i]. The effect of parental strains on y i was modeled using an overdispersed zero-truncated Poisson (ZTP) regression (data scales of the model in brackets):
(1)
where ZTPois(l i ) denotes a Poisson distribution with expected value l i but conditional on having observed that y i 6 = 0 (Appendix A), g is the link function g(x) = log(x), with inverse g 1 (x) = e x , that relates l i to a latent scale`i, and h i is a linear predictor on that latent scale with an error term # i ⇠ N(0, s 2 ) providing overdispersion. The linear predictor h i is then composed of an intercept µ, random effects for litter order (i.e., parity) u order [i] and batch (month) u batch[i] respectively (detailed below), where for example batch[i] refers to the batch containing litter i, and a further linear predictor d T {jk}[i] b (detailed below) that specifies the contributions of parental strains j and k (detailed below). The random effects for litter order and batch were both modeled as categorical random intercepts, u batch ⇠ N(0, t 2 batch ) and u order ⇠ N(c order · a, t 2 order ), where litter order is additionally predicted by c order , the order as a number, with fixed effect a.
The parental strain contribution d T {jk} b, is equivalent to the 'fullu' (full, unsexed) model described in (Lenarcic et al. 2012) , and is given below:
where I {A} is an indicator and equal to 1 if A is true and 0 otherwise, S {A} is a sign variable equal to 1 2 if A is true and 1 2 otherwise, b inbred is a fixed effect of being inbred, and all other variables (in classes a, m, b, v, w) are modeled as random effects with class-specific variances, for example, a 1 , . . . , a 8 are modeled as a j ⇠ N(0, t 2 a ). The a (""additive"") class represents strain-specific dosage effects, the m (""parental sex"") class represents asymmetric parent-of-origin effects, where positive values indicate that maternal effects are greater than paternal effects for a given strain, inbred penalty effects are comprised of overall (fixed) and strain-specific (random) b parameters, and epistatic effects are strain-pair specific deviations, both symmetric (v) and asymmetric (w).
To provide directional parent-of-origin effects for maternal and paternal strain we defined, by reparameterization of the additive and parental sex effect, the following two additional types of effect:
is the B6-specific dam (maternal strain) effect and sire B6 = a B6 m B6 is the B6-specific sire (paternal strain) effect. Posterior samples of these quantities were obtained as a post-processing step by reparameterizing posterior samples of a j and m j . Obtaining these as a post-processing step, rather than explicit modification of Equation 2, preserves the original Bayes-Diallel model and therefore has no effect on the effect estimates (or variance projection estimates) for the other diallel categories. (Parameter definitions summarized in Table S1 .)
Priors were chosen to be minimally informative. For fixed effects (µ, a, and b inbred ) we used N 0, 1 ⇥ 10 3 . For variances of random effects (s 2 , t 2 a , t 2 m , t 2 b , t 2 v , t 2 w , t 2 order , t 2 batch ) we used an inverse gamma distribution with scale and shape both equal to 0.001. Posterior effect estimates are presented as posterior mean (and median), and the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval.
In order to stably estimate the contribution of each variance class to the overall phenotype, we used the diallel variance projection [VarP; Crowley et al. (2014) ]. This is a heritability-like measure that partitions the overall phenotypic variance of an idealized future diallel experiment into additive, parent-of-origin (parental sex), inbred (dominance), epistatic, and other random/fixed effects categories in the diallel. VarPs were calculated both from the ZTP model described above, and, for comparison, from the standard Gaussian-outcome BayesDiallel model (using the Bayes-Diallel software) (Appendix A). The standard BayesDiallel model was applied to our data after litter size was subject to a variancestabilizing transformation, the square root, this corresponding to the linear mixed model approximation to the ZTP,
The standard BayesDiallel model under this transformation was also used to evaluate evidence in our data set for the inclusion (or exclusion) of each variable or class of variables in improving the model fit. Specifically, we calculated for each variance class a Volume X October 2018 | Fertility in a CC founder diallel cross | 3

We bred litters in an 8⇥8 inbred diallel of the CC founder strains, and generated all eight inbreds and 54 of 56 possible reciprocal F1 hybrids (Figure 1 , Figure S1 -S3). The eight inbred strains, displayed across the diagonal, were mated at higher frequencies both for maintenance of inbred strains and propagation of the diallel. For all 62 genetic inbred and hybrid crosses, we recorded the following information: mated pairs, wean dates, litter size at weaning, including total and sex-specific counts (File S1). This diallel cross was originally designed and maintained for the generation of F1 mice for several experimental projects (Koturbash et al. 2011; Aylor et al. 2011; Mathes et al. 2011; Kelada et al. 2012; Didion et al. 2012; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Calaway et al. 2013; Crowley et al. 2014; Phillippi et al. 2014; Odet et al. 2015; Crowley et al. 2015; Morgan et al. 2016; Percival et al. 2016; Shorter et al. 2017; Oreper et al. 2017; Maurizio et al. 2018) . As a result, certain reproductive measurements such as time between litters and maximum number of offspring per cross were necessarily biased by experimental breeding requirements. Average weaned litter size, however, is a reproductive trait that should be well-estimated independently of these factors.

We measured litter size and report the mean number of weaned pups per litter for the 62 viable crosses in the diallel (Figure 1) . A wide distribution of litter sizes was observed, ranging from an average of 3.6 weaned pups for WSB⇥WSB crosses, to an average of 9.1 weaned pups for NOD⇥PWK crosses, with an overall mean of 5.5 weaned pups per litter. Examining average litter sizes of the inbred strains across all 4 years, we found neglible evidence of consistent seasonal effects (F 11,2283 = 1.272 p = 0.23) ( Figure S4 ) but positive evidence of non-seasonal patterns: a modeled 'year.month' covariate significantly affected litter size (F 47,2247 = 2.44 p < .0001; see also Figure S5 ). The non-seasonal effect could be driven by the relocation of mice between vivariums, which occurred in February 2010. The housing facility may have an impact on litter size as well. To test this, we measured average litter size differences between the two housing facilities and found that two founder strains, 129S1 and WSB, had significantly larger average litter sizes at the Hillsborough facility than at UNC GMB with a difference of 5.87 to 4.42 weaned pups per litter (p < 0.0001) for 129S1, and 3.84 to 3.42 weaned pups per litter (p = 0.029) for WSB. The six other founder strains did not significantly differ in their average litter sizes between the two facilities, but tended to have smaller weaned litters at UNC GMB (see Discussion). For average litter size across the diallel, we tested for an effect of litter number (birth parity number, for a given mating pair) on the number of pups weaned in each litter. Previous research suggests that the first litter can be significantly smaller than subsequent litters due to various biological factors (De la Fuente and San Primitivo 1985). This effect was consistent in the diallel: we observed that there was significant reduction in litter size in the first litter (p < 0.0001) compared to the overall linear effect that parity has on reducing litter size ( Figure S5 ).
To estimate founder strain effects on litter size, we used a Bayesian regression model that decomposes the phenotypic variation in a diallel design into genetic and parent-of-origin contributions (Lenarcic et al. 2012 ). Using this model, litter size was estimated to have narrow sense heritability (h 2 approximated by VarP[additive]) accounting for 9.18% of the variance, with parent-of-origin effects (VarP[parental.sex]) accounting for 5.77%, the fact of being inbred (VarP[inbred.overall]) at 1.43%, and strain-by-strain interactions (VarP[epistatic.symmetric] + VarP[asymmetric.epistatic]) at 3.40% ( Figure 2A ); in aggregate, these factors explained 17.73% of the total variance for litter size in the founder diallel.
In more detail, we present estimates for all modeled diallel effects as posterior means and highest posterior density (HPD) intervals ( Figure 2B ). Parameters are divided into two groups: general effects and strain pair-specific effects. General effects comprise strain-specific additive effects (additive), strain-specific and overall inbred (inbred), and strain-specific parent-of-origin (parental sex) effects. Strain pair-specific (epistatic) effects are the effects that arise specifically in crosses of two heterologous strains, with 'v' referring to symmetric epistatic and 'w' referring to asymmetric epistatic effects (pairwise parent-of-origin effects). All classes of effect were determined to add positive value to the model fit (either strong or very strong evidence for inclusion; MIP > 0.986) except parental sex (the difference between male and female), whose value was equivocal (MIP=0.34) Table S2 ).
Under the general effects, we see significant positive additive effects on average litter size from B6, NOD, and NZO and significant negative additive effects on litter size from CAST, PWK, and WSB strain dosages. A similar pattern is seen in the parental sex effects, where B6 and NOD dosages have a significant positive effect on average litter size, whereas CAST, PWK, and WSB have significant negative effects. The ""inbred"" effect is negative indicating that inbred status has a negative overall effect on average litter size, regardless of parental strain. Each strain also has an individual inbred effect in addition to an overall inbred effect; the only strain with a positive inbred effect is NOD. When the individual inbred effects are taken into account with the overall ""inbred"" effect, inbred litters are on average slightly smaller than their heterozygous counterparts. For strain pair-specific epistatic effects, there are a few marginally noteworthy effects, with the most prominent being a negative asymmetric epistatic effect for PWK⇥NOD.
To more clearly differentiate the contributions of the mother vs. the father strain, we reparameterized the BayesDiallel model to capture effects specific to dam.strain and sire.strain (Figure 3) . B6 and NOD dams increase litter sizes by more than 1.26 fold, by an average of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, respectively, regardless of sire. CAST, PWK, and WSB dams tend to decrease average litter size by 0.90, 0.81, and 1.51 pups. The sire effect is similar, with NOD and NZO sires having larger litters and CAST sires producing smaller litters. As expected, we see that the dam.strain has a much larger influence on the variation of litter size compared with the sire.strain (13.15% vs. 1.81%).

We examined genetic and non-genetic effects on the average sex ratio per litter and found no evidence that sex ratio was skewed ( Figure S6 ; Figure S7 ). The overall mean for sex bias, quantified as number of male pups weaned divided by the total number of weaned pups, was 0.4979, and did not significantly differ from our expectation of a 50:50 sex ratio (Binominal test, two-tailed p = 0.219). For the eight inbred founders, 129S1 is the only strain that departed significantly from expectation, with slight reduction of males 0.475:0.525 (Binominal test, two-tailed p = 0.041). However, correction for multiple testing shows no significant sex ratio bias of any inbred strain. The outbred crosses have substantially fewer litters and offspring than the inbred matings, leading to less balanced sex ratios; however, when multiple testing is accounted for, they also show no significant deviations from expected sex ratios.
We have investigated factors influencing litter size in the eight CC founders and their F1 hybrids. We note that litter size is a component of reproductive performance, but distinct from total strain productivity; a study on total strain productivity would need to take into account litter size, numbers of litters, maximum reproductive age, and pup survival until breeding. Our results illustrate how mammalian litter size in a full diallel design is influenced by genotypic and environmental variation. They also address some of the factors that contributed to line extinction and breeding problems in generating the CC (Chesler et al. 2008; Philip et al. 2011; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Shorter et al. 2017) .
We estimated that genetic (additive, inbred, and epistatic) effects on average litter size explained 17.73% of variation, suggesting that most of the phenotypic variation arises from unexplained environmental effects. Within the explained variance, our estimate of the narrow sense heritability (h 2 = 0.092) for litter size may seem small, but it is within the range uncovered in previous research (Falconer 1960; Peripato et al. 2004; Gutiérrez et al. 2006) . Compared with the overall average litter, we observed substantial positive effects of B6 and NOD strains, from both additive genetic and parent-of-origin parameters, and substantial negative effects of PWK and WSB (Figure 2) . We also observed, as expected, that lower litter size was associated with being inbred (Figure 2A) .
During the G1 and G2 out-crossing generations of the CC, mean litter size was lower for crosses involving wild-derived strains, CAST, PWK and WSB (Philip et al. 2011) . A similar pattern is observed here, but these effects are determined to be specifically through the maternal strain, with CAST, PWK and WSB having negative ""dam"" effects on litter size (Figure 3) . It is likely that selection pressure in classical lab strains is associated with larger litters compared with the wild-derived strains. Additionally, two of the wild-derived strains, CAST and PWK, are from a different subspecific origin than the other six CC founders. This likely contributes to decreased productivity through subspecific incompatibilities (Shorter et al. 2017) .
We identify and report environmental factors that may influence litter size. The breeding of this diallel was performed across two different vivariums over the course of 4 years, and we see a significant effect from housing facility. The Hillsborough facility was associated with larger litters for all strains, especially 129S1 and WSB. The two facilities have many different factors that could explain these differences. The Hillsborough facility housed multiple species, including dogs and mice, had smaller rooms that held approximately 300 mouse cages, was remotely located in a rural area, had different laboratory personnel, had cage changes once a week, and was supplied with filtered well water. The diallel breeding at the GMB facility took place in a large central room, contained only laboratory mice, is located in a basement of a large seven story research building on campus, has cage changes every other week, and is supplied with filtered city water. It is possible that one or more of these factors, independently or in combination, affected productivity. Another finding was that seasonality, which has previously been shown to influence litter size and frequency of litters in mammals (Drickamer 1990) , did not seem to significantly impact litter size in this study. This is likely due to consistent light-dark cycles and temperatures as well as a steady diet. We did observe a significant effect on litter size after the transfer of the mice to the UNC GMB facility (February 2010), which reduced overall litter sizes from March to June 2010. This may have been due to the use of ivermectin during the time of the transfer. Other factors, such as the sex of the laboratory personnel interacting with the animals, are generally known to influence rodent behavior and could contribute to some of the environmentally-induced variation we observed (Sorge et al. 2014) .
Last, we measured sex ratio across all inbred and outbred crosses. Despite some departures from equality at the nominal significance threshold (alpha = 0.05), no associations with founder strain dosage remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Recent work has suggested a potential for bias in sex ratio driven by the male germline in Mus musculus (Conway et al. 1994; Macholán et al. 2008; Cocquet et al. 2009; Ellis et al. 2011; Cocquet et al. 2012; Turner et al. 2012; Larson et al. 2016) , particularly in intersubspecific hybrids that are mismatched for copy number of Xand Y-linked genes expressed in postmeiotic spermatids. Although there are no previous observations that suggest a bias in sex ratio in the CC or its founders, it remains an important characteristic to measure in a study on reproductive productivity.
To estimate heritable effects on liter size and sex ratio we extended the original BayesDiallel model of Lenarcic et al. (2012) in two new ways. First, to better understand and distinguish the effects arising from female and male parents, we reparameterized our strain-specific additive and parental-sex effects such that we could provide estimates of maternal strain and paternal strain effects separately. In the original BayesDiallel model, maternal and paternal strain effects are split into ""additive"" effects, which consolidates the effects they have in common, and ""parental sex"", which models any remaining deviation between the two. Recognizing that additive effects from the sire are essentially wiped out by the additive effects, we instead collapsed the additive and parental-sex effects into ""dam.strain"" and ""sire.strain"" effects in a post-processing step on the posterior output. This allowed us to run the original BayesDiallel model while also viewing our data from the perspective of dam strain and sire strain contributions.
Second, we reimplemented the original MCMC sampler, designed for modeling a continuous outcome variable, in a general package MCMCglmm (Hadfield 2010 ) in order to model count and binary responses. Litter size, as measured, is most naturally distributed as Poisson, with zero-truncation owing to the fact that only successful litters were recorded. Sex ratio is most naturally modeled as a binomial, with an underlying (male) proportion between 0 and 1. Although it would be possible to obtain an approximate analysis by transformations to normality using the original BayesDiallel (and we do this for litter size for some otherwise hard-to-obtain quantities), we found such approximations to be inadequate for reliable estimation of higher order effects in the case of litter size and deeply flawed in the case of sex ratio.
Although there is a computational cost, and added complexity to determining variance contributions, this new implementation achieves several objectives: 1) we no longer break the assumptions in the original model regarding normally distributed errors; 2) we easily accommodate overdispersion in our data; and 3) we can select from a large number of GLMMs ones that more closely resemble the forms of our data observations. In addition, we believe this flexibility will be appealing to many other researchers who would like to model non-Gaussian distributed phenotypes using diallel designs, and we have provided the code in an R package litterDiallel (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1435829).
Overall, these results have implications for other avenues of future research. Future multiparental research populations should test for strain incompatibilities, reproductive phenotyping, and other health traits in a full diallel before the recombinant inbreeding begins (Odet et al. 2015) . These future research populations should also use non-related wild-derived individuals from the same subspecific origin in order to increase genetic diversity without introducing hybrid incompatibilities.

We collected data on litter size at weaning for 62 genetic crosses of inbred lines, across four years of breeding.
We use zero-truncated poisson (ZTP) regression for modeling our data. This type of regression is explicit in its framework accounting for discrete observations, flexible in its ability to use linear mixed models on the latent scale, and allows for parameterization of excess variance observed, in a way that standard Poisson regression does not. We account for the zero depletion in our data by using ZTP regression instead of standard Poisson regression, since we exclude observations of birth cohorts where no pups survived to weaning.
In Figure 4 , the distribution of the observed data (litter size) is displayed for the WSB⇥WSB inbred mating, along with simulated data from a zero-truncated Poisson distribution based on the data mean. For the ZTP, the first two moments (mean and variance), for values y i > 0, are given by:
The relationship between the standard Poisson regression model (with overdispersion) is shown in Figure 5 . The ZTP modifies this by truncating values on the expected (log) data scale and observed data scale to be 1 or greater. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Diallel effect estimates are obtained using an MCMCglmm (Hadfield 2010) implementation of BayesDiallel (BayesDiallel-glmm, henceforth), with 1.515 ⇥ 10 6 iterations, 1.5 ⇥ 10 4 iterations of burnin, and thinning by 500 (saving only every 1/500 th iteration), to obtain 3000 independent samples with minimal autocorrelation, and plotted as highest posterior densities (HPDs) in the results.
The effects estimated from the BayesDiallel-glmm model are transformed from the latent scale to the (expected) data scale via the inverse link function, i.e. exp(a AJ ), for interpretability of effects on the original data scale.
To avoid the problem of interpretability in transforming variance parameter (and variance projection) estimates from the latent to the observed data scales, we instead calculate and report variance projections, as calculated on the Gaussian version of BayesDiallel. In order to account for heteroscedasticity (unequal variance) of the model residuals that arises from the approximately ZTPoisson nature of the data, we use a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) (Yu 2009 ) and run BayesDiallel again (Gaussian) to obtain Variance Projections on the modeled data. The VarPs that are calculated from these parameter estimates are an approximation of the variance contributions that we would observe in the GLMM BayesDiallel model.
We model the male pup counts and female pup counts jointly, using the BayesDiallel linear model, formulated for binomial GLMM regression. This model directly considers genetic effects on the imbalance in male vs. female pups by parameterizing the number of males and number of total pups (or the total, and the fraction of males in the total). The model is elaborated in the methods section of the main manuscript.
The proportion of weaned pups that are male, or equivalently, the proportion of weaned pups that are female, is approximated by a binomial distribution. In our data, the mean and the variance of male ratio are 0.494 and 0.063, respectively.
To generate the upper and lower 95% boundaries, as shown in Figure S6 , for the expected phenotype under the null hypothesis of male pup proportion = 0.5, we used the qbinom function in the stats package in R.

12c8ef5614d9a35bed3ff95a3b1dc971842514fe,"RNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication (albeit within a permissive environment). A 33.5-kb nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps on the road to DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of size constraints on RNP entities. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20-34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with a proofreading exoribonuclease encoded in the nidoviral open reading frame 1b (ORF1b). However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region, and overall 41.1 kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, and key replicative domains. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and subsequently acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts. PSCNV's greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique featuresimpressive in themselvesattest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery. author/funder.

RNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication. The upper genome size for such entities was assumed to be <35 kb; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the proposed evolution of contemporary DNA-RNP-based life from primordial RNP entities. Here, we describe a nidovirus from planarians, whose 41.1 kb genome is 23% larger than the largest known of RNA virus. The planarian secretory cell nidovirus has broken apparent constraints on the size of the genomic subregion that encodes core replication machinery, and has acquired genes not previously observed in RNA viruses. This virus challenges and advances our understanding of the limits to RNA genome size. author/funder. All rights reserved.

The feasibility of an autonomous ancient RNA genome and the mechanisms underlying such fateful transitions are challenging to reconstruct. It is especially unclear whether such RNA entities ever evolved genomes close to the 100-300 kilobases (kb) range (2, 3) of the ""minimal"" reconstructed cellular DNA genome (4) . This range overlaps with the upper size limit of nuclear pre-mRNAs (5) ; however, pre-mRNAs are incapable of self-replication, the defining property of primordial genomic RNAs.
RNA viruses may uniquely illuminate the evolutionary constraints on RNA genome size, whether or not they descended directly from primitive RNA-based entities (6) (7) (8) . The average-sized RNA virus genome is around 10 kb, due to low-fidelity RNA replication without proofreading (9) . However, positive-stranded RNA genomes of viruses of the order Nidovirales, which includes pathogenic coronaviruses, range from 12.7 to 33.5 kb, the largest known RNA genome (10, 11) (Fig. 1A , Table S1 ). These viruses may have evolved genomes larger than 20 kb after acquiring a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) that improved replication fidelity (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Despite this notable innovation, over the last 20 years of virus discovery, including unbiased metagenomics of invertebrate and vertebrate RNA viruses (18, 19) , the largest-known RNA viral genome has only increased ~10% in sizea mere fraction of the nearly ten-fold increase observed for DNA viruses (20) (21) (22) (Fig. 1A) . Apparently, genome sizes of large nidoviruses are tightly constrained by the interplay of genetic and hostspecific factors, with the size of open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), encoding key replicative enzymes, emerging as a major barrier for further genome expansion (23) . Hence, ~34 kb is considered the de facto limit of RNA virus genome size (18) .
Identification of a large RNA virus from planarians. To examine whether this limit applies beyond the currently recognized ~3000 RNA virus species that infect just hundreds of host species, further sampling of virus diversity is required. To this end, we analyzed de novo transcriptomes of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea (24) , in which viruses remain virtually unknown, and which exists as two reproductively distinct strains: sexuals that reproduce as simultaneous hermaphrodites and asexuals that reproduce via transverse fission (25) . We determined the complete genome sequence of a putative nidovirus corresponding to one particularly large contig (SI Text, Table S2 , Fig. S1 ). Excluding the polyadenylated tail, the fully assembled genome contains 41,103 nucleotides (nt) and encodes a single 40,671-nt ORF that is flanked by a 128-nt 5'-UTR and a 304-nt 3'-UTR (Fig. 1B,C) . The presence of this RNA in vivo was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification of overlapping regions of 4-7 kb, 5'-RACE, and multiple EST clones (Fig. S1) (26) . These sequences could not be amplified from S. mediterranea genomic DNA, nor could they be found in the genome (27) ; thus, they appear to derive from an exogenous source. Based on several criteria (see below), we assigned this RNA sequence to the genome of a virus we dubbed Planarian Secretory Cell Nidovirus (PSCNV). PSCNV circulates in both sexual and asexual host strains: analysis of RNA-seq data from three laboratories revealed its very low (<0.1%), albeit predominantly non-synonymous variation (SI Text, Tables S3,4). Analysis of Planaria torva transcriptome identified three contigs of the cumulative ~9400 nt size, whose regions displayed from 25% to 48% aa identity with PSCNV, indicative of at least one additional putative nidovirus (SI Text, Fig. S2 ) (28) . author/funder.

The PSCNV proteome reveals a unique nidovirus. The genome and proteome of PSCNV are by far the largest yet reported for an RNA virus. Its RNA genome is ~25% larger than that of the next-largest known RNA virus (also a nidovirus), which is separated by a comparable margin from the first nidovirus genome sequenced 30 years ago (Fig. 1A) . The size of the predicted PSCNV polyprotein (13,556 amino acids, aa) is 58-67% larger than the largest known RNA virus proteins produced from a single ORF (8,572 aa) or multiple ORFs through frameshifting (8,108 aa) (Fig. 1D) .
We delineated at least twenty domains in the PSCNV polyprotein using a complex multistage procedure that combined different analyses within a probabilistic framework ( Fig. 1C ; SI Text, Table S5 , and Figs. S3-S16). These domains include distant homologs of all ten domains characteristic of invertebrate nidoviruses (15, 29) and established with utmost confidence: seven ORF1a/1b enzymes (3C-like protease, 3CLpro; nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase, NiRAN; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp; superfamily 1 helicase, HEL1; exoribonuclease of DEDDh subfamily, ExoN; and SAM-dependent N7-and 2'-O-methyltransferases, N-MT and O-MT, respectively) and three non-enzymatic domains (transmembrane domain 2 and 3, TM2 and TM3, respectively; and zinc-binding domain, ZBD) (Fig. 1C) . These domains are syntenic in PSCNV and nidoviruses, with the conservation of NiRAN and ZBD in PSCNV being of particular significance, since both domains are the only known genetic markers of the order Nidovirales (29, 30) . Thus, these findings further support the phylogenetic affinity of PSCNV and nidoviruses (Fig. 1C) , which we quantified in separate analyses (see below). Accordingly, three functional regions corresponding to the ORF1a, ORF1b, and 3'ORFs of nidoviruses could be identified tentatively in the PSCNV genome, with three characteristic nidovirus domains mapping to the ORF1a-like region and seven domains to the ORF1b-like region.
The enzymatic domains contain most essential catalytic residues, suggesting that they retain canonical functions, although notable deviations were also observed (Figs. S7-S14). Unique features of PSCNV's putative enzymes include: a) 3CLpro encodes a valine (Val) residue in the position commonly occupied by a His residue in the putative substrate-binding pocket (GXV vs G/YXH) that controls the P1 substrate preference for Glu or glutamine (Gln) residues (31-35); b) a Ser residue of the nidovirus-specific SDD signature of RdRp (12) is replaced by glycine (Gly)a characteristic of ssRNA+ viruses other than nidoviruses; c) the invariant aspartate (Asp), along with the highly conserved Ser/Thr, of motif B N of the NiRAN (29) are substituted with Thr and Asn, respectively; d) four Cys/His residues coordinating a Zn 2+ in the active site of ExoN (16, 17) are replaced in PSCNV, which, like non-nidoviral homologs , apparently lacks this Zn-finger.
Conserved sequence features reveal that, as in other nidoviruses (12, 36) , the PSCNV 3'ORFs-like region may encode major structural proteins of enveloped virions, including the transmembrane glycoproteins known as S and M in coronaviruses, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (SI Text, Fig. S4 ). This region also appears to encode several notable domains: a ~130 aa region with Thr and Ser accounting for 70.7% of residues (Fig. S4 ); an Ankyrin domain (Figs. 1E and S16) and two fibronectin type II domains (FN2a and FN2b; Fig. S15 ), unique for RNA and all viruses, respectively. The Thr-rich and Thr/Ser-rich regions have been implicated in mediating adherence of fungal and bacterial extracellular (glyco) proteins to various substrates (37, 38) , suggesting a similar role in PSCNV. The Ankyrin domain might counteract host immune responses by suppressing the NF-kB signaling pathway, as observed in poxviruses (39) , while FN2a/b could facilitate virus dissemination (SI Text). author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/299776 doi: bioRxiv preprint Computational analysis suggests that PSCNV might have acquired the Ankyrin domain from a planarian host relatively late in evolution (Fig. 1E) , while the origins of the FN2 domains remain uncertain. We also identified a ribonuclease T2 homolog upstream of the putative 3CLpro in the ORF1a-like region (Fig. 1C) , in which all active-site residues are conserved ( Fig. S6 ). Pestivirus and polydnavirus ribonuclease T2 homologs modulate cell toxicity and immunity (40, 41) .
PSCNV likely derived from multi-ORF nidoviruses and expanded disproportionately in the ORF1b-like region. To learn about the evolution of PSCNV, we inferred the rooted phylogeny of PSCNV based on the RdRp protein domain of nidoviruses and two astroviruses ( Fig. 1F ; SI Text). PSCNV predominantly clustered with other invertebrate nidoviruses in the Bayesian sample, basal to either mesoni-and roniviruses (54.7% of the trees), roniviruses (20.6%), or mesoniviruses (13.4%). Ancestral state reconstruction analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestor of nidoviruses contained multiple ORFs (Log Bayes Factor 6.06) (Fig. S17) . Thus, the single-ORF organization of PSCNV likely emerged through loss of signals separating the three ORF regions of ancestral nidoviruses.
Compared to known nidoviruses, PSCNV genome size increased unevenly in the three main regions (Fig. 1G ,H, SI Text, Table S6 ). The size increase of the ORF1b-like region was an extraordinary 9-fold higher than would be expected from the extremely low variation in the size of this region among other nidoviruses normalized to genome size variation. This observation implies that PSCNV broke the tightly constrained ORF1b size barrier (23), but expanded modestly in the ORF1a-like and 3'ORFs-like regions. This pattern fits the wavelike dynamic model of genome expansion in nidoviruses (23) . Accordingly, extant nidovirus genomes of different sizes reached particular points on a common trajectory of genome expansion dominated by consecutive increases of ORF1b, ORF1a, and 3'ORFs. A complete cycle of genome expansion was reported to encompass the 12.7-31.7 kb range, with the expansion of ORF1b expected to lead a second cycle beyond that size range. The sizes of PSCNV's three main regions support this model, and show that nidoviruses were able to start a second cycle of genome expansion, whose feasibility has remained uncertain so far. This observation makes plausible the existence of other yet-undiscovered nidoviruses that have moved further along this genome-expanding trajectory.
PSCNV infects the secretory cells of planarians. We next examined PSCNV infection in planarian tissues by whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH). PSCNV RNA was detected abundantly in cells of the secretory system in both sexuals and asexuals ( Fig. 2A) . Fluorescent ISH revealed viral RNA in gland cell projections that form secretory canals (Fig.  2B) . Notably, viral RNA was detected largely in ventral cells (Fig. 2C ) whose localization corresponds to mucus-secreting cells producing the slime upon which planarians glide, and use to immobilize prey (42) .
We then analyzed planarians by electron microscopy (EM) for the presence of viral structures. Membrane-bound compartments with 90-150 nm spherical-to-oblong particles resembling nidoviral nucleocapsids (43, 44) were found in the cytoplasm of mucus-secreting cells, which are abundant in planarian parenchyma. These sub-epidermal gland cells are notable for their extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and long projections into the ventral epithelium, through which they secrete mucus (Fig. S18) . These cells provide an ideal environment for nidoviral replicationwhich co-opts host membranes to produce viral replication complexes (45) . Putative viral particles were found both in deep regions of these cells, and in their trans-epidermal projections (Fig. 3A-C) . The latter location suggests a author/funder. All rights reserved.

Notably, particles in sub-epidermal layers have a ""hazy"" appearance and are embedded in a relatively electron-dense matrix (Fig. 3D) . In contrast, particles closer to the apical surface of the epidermis appear as relatively discrete structures, standing out against electron-lucent surrounding material (Fig. 3E) . The size, ultrastructure, and host-cell locations are all consistent with these structures being nidoviral nucleocapsids (43, 44) .
Potential mechanisms for varying stoichiometries of viral proteins encoded by a single-ORF genome. Virus reproduction requires different viral protein stoichiometries at distinct replicative cycle stages, a challenge for a single-ORF genome theoretically producing equimolar quantities of encoded polypeptides. For example, the putative structural proteins encoded by 3'ORFs are needed in much larger quantities than replicative enzymes at the end of nidovirus infection, and vice versa. We analysed the PSCNV genome and its transcript expression to resolve this apparent paradox.
Nidoviruses use -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) at the ORF1a/1b border to attenuate the synthesis of major replicative enzymes upon genome translation (46) . We located a potential -1 PRF signal in the canonical position in the PSCNV genome (SI Text). This signal could potentially attenuate in-frame translation downstream of the ORF1a-like region (Fig. 4A ) similar to a mechanism used by encephalomyocarditis virus (47) .
The PSCNV putative 3CLpro domain is expected (31) to release itself and all downstream polyprotein components up to the border between the ORF1b-and 3'ORFs-like regions (Fig.  1C) . The polyprotein region processed by 3CLpro, and its flanking regions, are of comparable sizes (5006 vs 4400 and 4150 aa), suggesting further posttranslational processing. Indeed, we have identified a number of candidate cleavage sites for host furinlike proteases (Fig. S4) , commonly involved in processing viral glycoprotein precursors (48) (SI Text).
We obtained several lines of evidence for upregulated transcription of the 3'ORFs-like region (Fig. 4B-D; SI Text). The PSCNV genome contains a pair of 59 and 57-nt imperfect repeats with 86% identity starting at positions 3 and 28,389, respectively (Fig. 4B) ; their positioning immediately upstream of ORF1a-like and at the border between ORF1b-and 3'ORFs-like regions resembles that of leader and body transcription-regulating sequences (l-and bTRSs) in other nidoviruses (49) . Accordingly, we found a sharp (~3-fold) change in RNA-seq read coverage at the bTRS. We identified an RNA species (by 5'-RACE), whose first two and following 57 nucleotides matched the genomic 5'-terminal AU followed by the bTRS (Fig.  4B) , suggesting the presence of a subgenomic mRNA produced by discontinuous transcription. Furthermore, the bTRS potentially forms strong complementary interactions with its upstream and downstream sequences (Fig. 4C ). When unwound, the upstream sequence can form a duplex with the lTRS, bringing together the two spatially separated genomic regions, consistent with a model of discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis (Fig.  4D) resembling that of other nidoviruses (50) .
The advent of metagenomics and transcriptomics have greatly accelerated the pace of virus discovery, leading to studies reporting genome sequences of dozens to thousands of new RNA viruses in poorly characterized hosts (18, 19, 51, 52) .

Notwithstanding that sea change, the largest known RNA genomes continue to belong to nidoviruses, as has been the case for 30 years since the first coronavirus genome of 27 kb was sequenced (11, 15, 55) (Fig. 1A) . The unbiased, transcriptomics-based discovery of PSCNV in planarians reinforces the status of nidoviruses as relative giants among RNA viruses, while demonstrating that RNA genomes may be substantially larger than previously understood. Further, genomic and proteomic characteristics of PSCNV defy the perceived central role of multiple ORFs in the life cycle and evolution of nidoviruses. Contrary to conventional wisdom, single-ORF genome expression may involve subgenomic mRNA synthesis, while functional constraints linked to the synteny of key replicative enzymes may be the hallmark characteristics of nidoviruses. Since the ORF1b-size barrier can be overcome and genome organization changed, nidoviruses of yet-to-be-sampled hosts might prove to have evolved even larger RNA genomes than that reported here, further decreasing the gap between virus RNA and host DNA genome sizes.

PSCNV genome and its variants in S. mediterranea RNA-seq data. PSCNV genome was assembled based on contigs identified in two de novo transcriptomes of S. mediterranea (24) by comparison with genome of human coronavirus OC43 (KY014282.1) using tblastx (BLAST+ v2.2.29 (56)); termini of the assembly were completed by contigs from the two transcriptomes and planarian EST clones (26) , identified by similarity to the incomplete assembly using blastn, and 5'-RACE amplicons. Reads from planarian RNA-seq datasets: inhouse ones used to assemble the two transcriptomes, and the ones available from EBI ENA (57) , were mapped to the PSCNV genome sequence by either CLC Genomics Workbench 7, or Bowtie2 version 2.1.0 (58); read counts and coverage were estimated using SAMtools 0.1.19 (59) , genome sequence variants were called by BCFtools 1.4 (60) .
Freshly prepared RNA from mature sexual planarians was used for cDNA synthesis (iScript, Bio-Rad) or 5'-RACE (RLM-RACE, Ambion) according to manufacturer instructions. Large overlapping amplicons across the PSCNV genome (primers in Table S2 ) were amplified by standard Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA polymerase reaction with 65ºC primer annealing temperature and 10 min extension steps.
In situ hybridization. Colorimetric and fluorescent in situ hybridizations were done following published methods (61) . Digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled PSCNV probes were generated by antisense transcription of the planarian EST clone PL06016B2F06 (GenBank DN313906.1) (26). Following color development, all samples were cleared in 80% (v/v) glycerol and imaged on a Leica M205A microscope (colorimetric) or a Carl Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope (fluorescent).
Sexual and asexual planarians originating from the Newmark laboratory were fixed and processed for epoxy (Epon-Araldite) embedding as previously described (62) . For light-microscopic histology, 0.5 µm sections were stained with 1% (w/v) toluidine blue O in 1% (w/v) borax for 30 s at 100 º C, and imaged on a Zeiss Axio Observer.

Genome and Protein databases. For various analyses we used the following databases: PlanMine (28) , Smed Unigene (64), scop70_1.75, pdb70_06Sep14 and pfamA_28.0 supplemented with profiles of conserved nidovirus domains (65) (66) (67) , Uniprot (68), list of genome sequences representing nidovirus species (69) , NCBI Viral Genomes Resource (70), GenBank (71) and RefSeq (72) .
Computational protein and RNA sequence analyses. Virus protein sequences were analyzed to predict disordered regions (DisEMBL 1.5 (73)), transmembrane regions (TMHMM v.2.0), secondary structure (Jpred4 (74)), signal peptides (SignalP 4.1 (75) ), Nglycosylation sites (NetNGlyc 1.0) and furin cleavage sites (ProP 1.0 (76)). To identify sites enriched with amino acid residue, distribution of each residue along polyprotein sequence was assessed using permutation test executed with a custom R script. Generation of multiple sequence alignments of RNA virus proteins was facilitated by Viralis platform (77) . Protein homology profile-based analyses were assisted with HMMER 3.1 (78) , and HH-suite 2.0.16 (79) . To predict RNA secondary structure and PRF sites we used Mfold web server (80) and KnotInFrame (81), respectively. Blastn (BLAST+ v2.2.29) (56) was used to identify RNA repeats.
Evolutionary analyses. Phylogeny was reconstructed by Bayesian approach using a set of tools including BEAST 1.8.2 package (82) and ProtTest 3.4 (83) as described in (84) . BayesTraits V2 (85) was used to perform ancestral state reconstruction. Preference for a state at a node was considered statistically significant only if Log BF exceeded 2 (86) .
Protein alignments were visualized with the help of ESPript 2.1 (87) . To visualize Bayesian samples of trees, DensiTree.v2.2.1 was used (88) . R was used for visualization (89) .

Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 (5.6 -7.7, 95% CI) days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.","Early January 2020, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the infectious agent that causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, where the first cases had their symptom onset in December 2019 [1] . This newly discovered virus causes a severe acute respiratory disease. The rapid spread in Wuhan and throughout China poses a great strain on health care system and disrupts the local societies. The multiple cases showing up outside China cause international concern.
The virus is related to the SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus, but is distinct from each of those viruses [2] , such that the epidemiological key parameters have to be identified for this new virus from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. Chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution. The range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine. Moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. The distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3 -5] and the transmission potential [6, 7] . In absence of data on the 2019-nCoV incubation period, the WHO has worked with a broad range of 0 to 14 days, the CDC has taken a range of 2 to 14 days, and several studies have assumed incubation periods of SARS or MERS coronaviruses.
Here we present the distribution of incubation periods estimated for travellers from Wuhan with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, using their reported travel histories and symptom onset dates.

In January 2020 an increasing number of cases were detected outside Wuhan, China and confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. For 88 cases detected between 20 and 28 January, the travel history (to and) from Wuhan is known as well as their symptom onset date. Their ages range from 2 to 72 years old (with four missing), 31 of them are women, 57 are men. During this initial stage of the epidemic, it is most likely that these travellers were The data used for this analysis has been translated from Chinese sources and made publicly available [8] . We took the data as available on January 29, 2020 (supplementary material S1).

Using the duration of stay in Wuhan and the symptom onset date, we obtained a range of possible values for the incubation period of each case. We fitted three parametric forms for the incubation period distribution to these ranges: the Weibull distribution, the gamma distribution, and the lognormal distribution. We used a Bayesian approach to fitting, that allows for the use of prior knowledge to inform the analysis. We specified strictly positive flat prior probability distributions for the parameter values of the three distributions (supplementary material S2), which ensured our estimates are conservative. Because of the high number of observations, the impact of the priors on the outcome was negligible. We used a uniform prior probability distribution over the exposure interval for the moment of infection for each case. We sampled from the posterior distribution using the rstan package [9] in R [10] (supplementary material S3). Figure 1 shows the time line for each case, where the cases without a maximum incubation period lack an unexposed (gray) period. However, the estimated infection times for these cases are close to the end of the exposure window, informed by the cases that do have a maximum incubation period.

The mean incubation period was estimated to be 6.4 (5.6 -7.7, 95% credible interval) days. The incubation period ranges from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile) (Tab. 2 and Fig. 2 ). The results using the gamma distribution provide a slightly poorer description of the data but provide a similar range from 2.4 to 12.5 days. Although the lognormal distribution provides the poorest fit to the data, the incubation period ranging from 2.4 to 15.5 days (2.5 th to 97.5 th percentile) may be relevant for a conservative choice of quarantine periods. .

A comparison to the estimated incubation period distribution for MERS (Tab. 3 and Fig. 3) shows that the values are remarkably similar, with mean values differing at most 1 day and 95 th percentiles differing at most 2 days. The estimated mean incubation periods for SARS are more variable between studies, including values shorter and longer than presented here for 2019-nCoV. These findings imply that findings of previous studies that have assumed incubation period distribution similar to MERS or SARS will not have to be adapted because of a shorter or longer incubation period.

We characterized the distribution of incubation periods for Chinese travellers infected with 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, who were reported as cases between 20 and 28 January 2020. The study provides empirical evidence to back reports on a familial cluster where five family members developed symptoms 3 -6 days after exposure [18] and a reported range from 2 to 11 days based on 16 travellers between Wuhan and Guangdong [19] . It fits within the range from 0 to 14 days that has been assumed by the WHO.
In our analysis we assumed a uniform prior probability of being infected during the period of stay in Wuhan. Since the epidemic was developing during that time period, it is more likely that travellers were infected toward the end rather than the beginning of their stay. This .

The travellers in this study represent a selective sample of the reported cases. We found travellers to be more often male and younger than the cases reported. The numbers are too small to detect systematic differences in incubation time with age or sex. Because we only have information on confirmed cases, there is likely a bias towards more severe cases in areas with a functioning health care system. As the epidemic continues, it remains important to collect more information on incubation periods of 2019-nCoV cases of older ages, of persons with underlying morbidity, of women, and of persons with mild symptoms.
There are various choices one can make about the parametric form of the incubation period distribution. The results with the three often-used forms we report here suggest that there is little impact on the mean and dispersion of the incubation periods. Of these three, the lognormal distribution assigns higher probabilities to longer incubation periods. Although we found that this distribution provided a poorer description of the data than the Weibull and the gamma distributions, it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic.
Our study helps in choosing an appropriate duration for quarantine. Keeping infected persons in quarantine up to 14 days will ensure that they do not develop symptoms after release.

136ee862ad53b606c8f2bea917b9705f5079e88e,"We developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside of China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.","A cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019. The cause of the pneumonia cases was identified as a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, recently renamed as SARS-CoV-2, the cause of coronavirus disease COVID-19). The first patient showing symptoms was recorded by Chinese authorities on 8 December 2019 [1] . On 9 January 2020, WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus had been isolated from one of the hospitalized persons [2] , and the first death case was reported on the same day. The first case outside China was witnessed on 13 January in Thailand [3] , and in the following days, several other countries also reported 2019-nCoV cases [4] . The first confirmed cases in China, but outside Hubei province, were reported on 19 January. [4] . As of 1 February, there were 14,628 confirmed cases worldwide (out of which 14,451 happened in China) with 305 total deaths [5] .
Since no specific antiviral agent is available for treatment of this infection, and there is no vaccine [6] , the control measures, introduced both in China and other countries, aimed to prevent the transmission. A metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and nearby cities was introduced on 23-24 January [7] . Several airports and train stations have started temperature screening measures to identify people with fevers [8] . All public transportation was suspended in Wuhan from 10 a.m., 23 January, including all outbound trains and flights, and all bus, metro and ferry lines; additionally, all outbound trains and flights were halted [9] . Construction of a specialist emergency hospital was started in Wuhan [10] , and nearly 6000 medical workers were sent to Wuhan from across China [11] . Beijing also announced the suspension of all inter-provincial bus and train services; several touristic attractions, including the Forbidden City and Shanghai Disneyland were closed [9] . Other countries also introduced control measures, including screening passengers arriving from China and closing their borders [12] . Several airlines, including British Airways and Lufthansa, canceled all flights to and from mainland China [9] .
The potential dangers of 2019-nCoV have prompted a number of studies on its epidemiological characteristics. The 2018 travel data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) were used to identify the countries and their infectious disease vulnerability indexes (IDVIs) [13] , which received substantial travel inflow from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport [14] . The IDVI has a range of 0-1, with a higher score implying lower vulnerability. The top destinations, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei, all have an IDVI above 0.65.
It is essential to estimate the number of infections (including those that have not been diagnosed), to be able to analyze the spread of the disease. To that end, data on exported infections and individual-based mobility models were used by several researchers, obtaining comparable numbers. For 17 January 2020, preliminary estimates were given for various scenarios in the range 350-8400 by Chinazzi et al. for the total number of infections up to that date [15] . Imai et al. [16] also estimated the total number of infections in China and warned that the number is likely to substantially exceed that of the officially confirmed cases (see also [17] ). They reported an estimate of 4000 infections (range: 1000-9700) by 18 January 2020. Nishiura et al. calculated 5502 (range: 3027-9057) infections by 24 January 2020 [18] .
To better assess the epidemic risk of 2019-nCoV, among the key parameters to be approximated are the basic reproduction number R 0 and the incubation period. We summarize previous efforts made toward those ends in Table 1 , and present a short summary below. The majority of the estimates for R 0 range between 2 and 3. Obtaining these was done by modeling epidemic trajectories and comparing them to the results of [16] as a baseline [19, 20] , using a negative binomial distribution to generate secondary infections. Liu et al. utilized the exponential growth and maximum likelihood estimation methods and found that the 2019-nCoV may have a higher pandemic risk than SARS-CoV in 2003 [21] .
Read et al. based their estimates on data from Wuhan exclusively (available up to 22 January 2020) and a deterministic SEIR model [22] . The choice of this date is motivated by the actions of authorities, that is the substantial travel limitations the next day. Li et al. used solely the patient data with illness onset between 10 December 2019 and 4 January 2020 [24] . The Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have analyzed 3 of 12 2019-nCoV using SEIR and multiple data series [25] . Shen et al. used a SEIJR model (where J denotes the compartment of diagnosed and isolated individuals) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations [26] similarly to [27] . An alternative approach was presented by Majumder and Mandl [23] as they obtained their estimate based on the cumulative epidemic curve and the incidence decay and exponential adjustment (IDEA) model [31] .
The incubation period was estimated to be in between 4.6 and 5.8 days by various studies. The first calculations used data up to 23 January [21] . Weibull distribution was identified as the best-fit model by several researches when comparing LogNormal, Gamma, and Weibull fits. Backer et al. used newly available patient data with known travel history and identified the Weibull distribution as the one with the best LOO (Leave-One-Out) score [28] ; Linton et al. gave estimates for with and without Wuhan residents using their statistical model with, again, the Weibull distribution scoring the best AIC (Akaike information criterion) [29] . The Johns Hopkins University Infectious Disease Dynamics Group has been collecting substantial data on exposure and symptom onset for 2019-nCoV cases. They recommend using their LogNormal estimate [30] , which gives a 5.1 day incubation period.
In this study we combine case estimates, epidemiological characteristics of the disease, international mobility patterns, control efforts, and secondary case distributions to assess the risks of major outbreaks from imported cases outside China.
Our method has three main components:
We estimate the cumulative number of cases in China outside Hubei province after 23 January, using a time-dependent compartmental model of the transmission dynamics. (ii)
We use that number as an input to the global transportation network to generate probability distributions of the number of infected travellers arriving at destinations outside China.
In a destination country, we use a Galton-Watson branching process to model the initial spread of the virus. We calculate the extinction probability of each branch initiated by a single imported case, obtaining the probability of a major outbreak as the probability that at least one branch will not go extinct.
The starting point of our transmission model is 23 January, when major cities in Hubei province were closed [7] . From this point forward, we run a time dependent SE n I m R model in China outside Hubei, which was calibrated to be consistent with the estimated case numbers outside Hubei until 31 January. We impose time dependence in the transmission parameter due to the control measures progressively implemented by Chinese authorities on and after 23 January. With our baseline R 0 = 2.6, disease control is achieved when more than 61.5% of potential transmissions are prevented. We introduce a key parameter t * to denote the future time when control measures reach their full potential. For this study we assume it to be in the range of 20-50 days after 23 January. Using our transmission model, we calculate the total cumulative number of cases (epidemic final size) outside Hubei, for each t * in the given range. This also gives an upper bound for the increasing cumulative number of cases C = C(t).

The output C of the transmission model is used as the pool of potential travellers to abroad, and fed into the online platform EpiRisk [32] . This way, we evaluated the probability that a single infected individual is traveling from the index areas (in our case Chinese provinces other than Hubei) to a specific destination. Using a ten day interval for potential travel after exposure (just as in [15] ), one can find from EpiRisk that in the January-February periods, assuming usual travel volumes, there is a 1/554 probability that a single case will travel abroad and cause an exported case outside China. The dataset for relative importation risks of countries is available as well; thus, one can obtain the probability of an exported case appearing in a specific country. This probability is denoted by θ 0 , and we call it the baseline connectivity of that country with China. The baseline connectivity can be affected by other factors, such as the reduction in travel volume between the index and destination areas, exit screening in China, and the efficacy of entry screening at the destination country. Hence, we have a compound parameter, the actual connectivity θ, which expresses the probability that a case in China outside Hubei will be eventually mixed into the population of the destination country. For example, the relative risk of Japan is 0.13343, meaning that 13.343% of all exportations are expected to appear in Japan. Thus, under normal circumstances, the probability that a case from China eventually ends up in Japan is 0.13343/554 = 2.41 × 10 −4 during the January-February period [32] . Assuming a 20% reduction in travel volume between China and Japan, this baseline connectivity is reduced to a connectivity 0.8 × 2.41 × 10 −4 = 1.928 × 10 −4 . Additionally, assuming a 40% efficacy on entry screening [33] , there is a 0.6 probability that an arriving case passes the screening, and the connectivity parameter is further reduced to 0.6 × 1.928 × 10 −4 = 1.16 × 10 −4 . If we assume interventions at the originating area, for example, exit screening with 25% efficacy, then our actual connectivity parameter is θ = 0.75 × 1.16 × 10 −4 = 8.7 × 10 −5 , which represents the probability that a case in China will eventually mix into the population in Japan. Assuming independence, this θ, together with the cumulative cases C, generates a binomial distribution of importations that enter the population of a given country.
Each imported case that passes the entry screening and mixes into the local population can potentially start an outbreak, which we model by a Galton-Watson branching process with negative binomial offspring distribution with dispersion parameter k = 0.64 [19, 20] and expectation R loc , where R loc is the local reproduction number of the infection in a given country. Each branch has extinction probability z, which is the unique solution of the equation z = g(z) on the interval (0, 1), where g is the generating function of the offspring distribution (see [34] ). The process dies out if all the branches die out; thus, we estimate the risk of a major local outbreak from importation as 1 − z i , where i cases were imported.
The number of imported cases i is given by a random variable X, where X ∼ Binom(C, θ). The outbreak risk in a country x is then estimated as Risk
where E is the expectation of the outbreak probabilities; thus, we consider a probability distribution of branching processes. This way Risk x = Risk(C, θ, R loc ), which means that the risk depends on the efficacy of Chinese control measures that influence the cumulative case number C, the connectivity between the index and destination areas θ, and the local reproduction number R loc . The main question we aim to get insight into is how this risk depends on these three determining factors.
The technical details of the modeling and calculations can be found in Appendices A, B, and C.

After calibration of the SE 2 I 3 R model, we numerically calculated the final epidemic size (total cumulative number of cases) in China outside Hubei, using three different basic reproduction numbers and different control functions. The control functions were parametrized by t * , which is the time after 23 January at which the control reaches its maximal value u max . Smaller t * corresponds to more rapid implementation of the control measures. In Figure 1 , we plotted these cumulative numbers versus t * , and we can observe that the epidemic final size is rather sensitive to the speed of implementation of the control measures. These curves also give upper bounds for the number of cumulative cases at any given time, assuming that the control efforts will be successful. 
We generated a number of plots to depict Risk(C, θ, R loc ) for selected groups of countries from America, Europe, and Asia.
In the left of Figure 2 , we can see the risks of American countries as functions of cumulative number of cases C, assuming each country has R loc = 1.6 and their connectivity is their baseline θ. When C exceeds 600,000, with this local reproduction number and without any restriction in importation, outbreaks in the USA and Canada are very likely, while countries in South America (including Mexico), which are all in the green shaded region, still have moderate risks. To illustrate the impacts of control measures for the USA and Canada, we reduced R loc to 1.4, and plotted the risks for different levels of reduction in connectivity to China, either due to travel restrictions or entry screening; see Figure 2 on the right. As the number of cases in China approaches one million, such reductions have a limited effect on the risk of outbreak. Figure 1 provides us with scenarios when C remains below certain values.

They have similar baseline connectivity θ, and we focus on how travel restrictions and entry screenings can potentially reduce their risks, assuming different values of R loc in the case C = 150,000 (on the left of Figure 3 ) and C = 600,000 (on the right of Figure 3 ). For illustration purposes, we plotted Thailand (red) and the Republic of Korea (blue), but Taiwan and Japan are always between those two curves. We can see that, for example, on the right of Figure 3 for C = 600,000, unless R loc is very small, considerable reduction of the outbreak risk can be achieved only by extreme measures that prevent most importations. In Figure 4 , we assumed that European countries have very similar R loc and looked at their risks as a function of the number of cases. For illustration purposes, we selected countries which have relatively high (UK, Germany, France, Italy), medium (Belgium, Poland, Hungary), and low (Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania) connectivity to China. On the left, we assumed R loc = 1.4 and baseline θ, and with these parameters, outbreaks will likely occur in high risk countries as the case number approaches one million. By reducing R loc to 1.1 and by reducing θ to the half of its baseline (meaning that we assume .

We also plotted the risks on a two-parameter map, as functions of θ and R loc . Observing the gradients of the risk map, we can conclude that countries with low connectivity but high R loc should focus on further reducing importations by entry screening and travel restrictions, while countries with high connectivity but smaller R loc better focus on control measures that potentially further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle benefit most from the combination of those two types of measures. 
By combining three different modelling approaches, we created a tool to assess the risk of 2019-nCoV outbreaks in countries outside of China. This risk depends on three key parameters: the cumulative number of cases in areas of China which are not closed, the connectivity between China and the destination country, and the local transmission potential of the virus. Quantifications of the outbreak risks and their dependencies on the key parameters were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe, representing a variety of country profiles.
There are several limitations of our model, as each ingredient uses assumptions, which are detailed in the Appendices. There are great uncertainties in the epidemiological parameters as well. It is difficult to predict the epidemic trajectory in China, as the effects of the control measures are not clear yet. There were recent disruptions in international travel, suggesting that the EpiRisk parameters will not be accurate in the future. Nevertheless, when we have new information in the future about the case numbers in China, travel frequencies, efficacy of entry screenings, and local control measures, our method will still be useful for assessing outbreak risks.
We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions (see Figure 5 ). Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies.
Different control measures affect different key parameters. Several of these measures have been readily implemented in China, aiming to prevent transmissions. These are incorporated into our transmission model influencing the cumulative number of cases C. The connectivity θ may be affected, for example, by exit screening at Chinese airports, entry screening at the destination airport, and a .

The parameter R loc is determined by the characteristics and the control measures of the destination country. As new measures are implemented, or there is a change in travel patterns, these parameters may change in time as well.
Cumulative cases and connectivity can be estimated, in general. However, to make a good assessment of the outbreak risk, it is very important to estimate R loc in each country. In the absence of available transmission data, one may rely on the experiences from previous outbreaks, such as the detailed description in [35] of the reductions in the effective reproduction numbers for SARS due to various control measures. In this study, we used a range of R loc values between the critical value 1 and the baseline R 0 = 2.6. A further source of uncertainty is in the distribution of the generation time interval, since a different distribution gives a different outbreak risk even with the same R loc . For our calculations, we used the distribution from [19] (see also [20] ); a more in-depth discussion of this topic may be found in [36] . Knowing R loc and the generation interval are needed not only to have a better quantitative risk estimation, but also for guidance as to which types of control measures may reduce the outbreak risk the most effectively.

This is an extension of a standard SEIR model assuming gamma-distributed incubation and infectious periods, with the Erlang parameters n = 2, m = 3 (following the SARS-study [37] ). Note that the choice of n = 2 is also consistent with the estimates summarized in Table 1 . Given that disease fatalities do not have significant effect on the total population, we ignored them in the transmission model to ease the calculations (i.e., µ = 0 was used). In this model, the basic reproduction number is R 0 = β/γ, the incubation period is α −1 and the infectious period is γ −1 . The model is used to describe the disease dynamics in China outside Hubei province after 23 January. We assume that at time t after 23 January, an increasing control function u(t) represents the fraction of the transmissions that are prevented, thus the effective reproduction number becomes R(t) = (1 − u(t))R 0 S(t)/N.
Based on the previous estimates from the literature (see Table 1 ), we chose an incubation period α −1 = 5.1 days [30] , basic reproduction number R 0 = 2.6 (2.1-3.1) with the corresponding infectious period γ −1 = 3.3 (1.7-5.6) days [19] . To predict the final number of cases outside Hubei, we assume a gradually increasing control u from zero until a saturation point, and define t * the time when the eventual control u max is achieved. The sooner this happens, the more successful the control is. Using the control term u(t) = min{u max t/t * , u max }, disease control is reached at t = t * (1 − 1/R 0 )/u max . For the calculations we choose u max = 0.8, noting that such a drop in transmission has been observed for SARS, where the reproduction number was largely reduced by subsequent interventions [35] . With our baseline R 0 = 2.6, disease control R(t) < 1 is achieved when u(t) > 0.615, meaning that more than 61.5% of potential transmissions are prevented, which occurs at time t = 0.77t * .
Since the first case outside Hubei was reported on 19 January [5] , for the initialization of the model we could assume that number of infected individuals on 23 January outside Hubei was equal to the number of cumulative cases outside Hubei up to that day. To calibrate the model, we estimated the number of cases from 24 January till 31 January outside Hubei based on case exportations, using the methodology of [15] , assuming that exportations after 24 January were only from outside Hubei. Based on the maximal likelihood of case numbers that produce the observed number of exportations using EpiRisk [32] , we estimate that the reported confirmed cases represent only 6.3% of the total cases for the regions outside Hubei (other estimates for ascertainment rate were: 5.1% [22] , 10% in [38] , and 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0) [39] ), see the inset in Figure 1 . The initial values for the exposed compartments in the SEIR model were selected such that the model output was consistent with the estimated case numbers outside Hubei between 24 January and 31 January. Solving the compartmental model, we obtained final epidemic sizes for various reproduction numbers and control efforts (see Figure 1 ), providing upper bounds for the cumulative number of cases C outside Hubei.
We create a probabilistic model to estimate the risk of a major outbreak in a destination country as a function of the cumulative number of cases C in China outside the closed areas, the local reproduction number R loc in the destination country, and the connectivity θ between China and the destination country.

We assume that the number of the imported cases entering the local population of the destination country follows a binomial distribution, i.e., the probability p i corresponding to i imported cases in the destination country with connectivity θ to China is given by
We calculate the extinction probability z of a branching process initiated by a new infection in the destination country. As in [19, 20] , we assume the number of secondary infections to follow a negative binomial distribution with generator function
with dispersion parameter k and mean µ = R loc . Then, the probability parameter q of the distribution is obtained as q = k k+R loc . The extinction probability of a branch is the solution of the fixed point equation z = g(z).
Assuming that the destination country has i imported cases from China that are mixed into the local population, we estimate the probability of a major outbreak as the probability that not all the branches started by those i individuals die out, which is 1 − z i . Thus, the expectation of the risk of a major outbreak in country x can be calculated as
where we used the binomial theorem to simplify the sum. Having the input values of the parameters C, θ, R loc , with this model we can numerically calculate the risk.",Risk Assessment of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Outbreaks Outside China,medrxiv,10.1101/2020.02.04.20020503,,,medrvix,2020-02-05,Peter Boldog; Tamas Tekeli; Zsolt Vizi; Attila Denes; Ferenc Bartha; Gergely Rost,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv

Early detection of outbreaks is improved by systems that are pathogen-specific. We describe a system, FilmArray ® Trend, for rapid disease 45 reporting that is syndrome-based but pathogen-specific. Results from a multiplex molecular diagnostic test are sent directly to a cloud database. www.syndromictrends.com presents these data in near real-time. Trend preserves patient privacy by removing or obfuscating patient identifiers. We summarize the respiratory pathogen results, for 20 organisms from 344,000 patient samples acquired as standard of care testing over the last four years from 20 clinical 50 laboratories in the United States. The majority of pathogens show influenza-like seasonality, rhinovirus has fall and spring peaks and adenovirus and bacterial pathogens show constant detection over the year. Interestingly, the rate of pathogen co-detections, on average 7.7%, matches predictions based on the relative abundance of organisms present. 55 All rights reserved.

Additionally, numerous next generation, syndromic surveillance systems; e.g., pharmacy sales 70 records [17, 18], Twitter conversations [19, 20], and Wikipedia hits [21, 22], have come online in the past five years. However, these systems cannot report the specific pathogen causing an increase in a particular set of symptoms. Finally, there are more localized efforts such as GermWatch in Utah [23, 24] and the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS) in New York [25, 26] that draw from hospital (HIS) and laboratory (LIS) information systems. 75
This disparity in technologies and data collection methods results in incomplete surveillance.
Comprehensive and uniform diagnostic test data will aid in the identification of potential outbreaks. A combination of broad respiratory pathogen testing and an internal electronic surveillance system enabled the rapid dissemination of data across the largest health care system 80 in New York, the North Shore-LIJ Health System (now Northwell Health) during the influenza A H1N1-2009 pandemic in the New York City area. Pathogen-specific molecular testing permitted rapid a) notification to state epidemiologists; b) tracking of the virus so that health care resources could be managed effectively; and c) evaluation of influenza diagnostics [27, 28] .
Today, with the threat of emerging pathogens such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 85 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.","The availability of real-time surveillance data that can monitor the spread of infectious diseases benefits public health [1] [2] [3] . At present, tracking of respiratory or foodborne outbreaks relies on a variety of methods ranging from automated real-time electronic reporting to manual web entry of 60 test results. Systems such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) FluView [4, 5] , National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance Systems (NREVSS, [6] ), National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS [7, 8] ), Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) [9] , and others, although web-based still require manual entry of data from laboratories, resulting in data that are often incomplete or not current. 4 coronavirus (MERS CoV), avian influenza, enterovirus D68, and Ebola virus, real-time surveillance programs are critical [1, 29, 30 ].
It is not always possible to accurately diagnose the causative agents of most infectious diseases from symptoms alone due to overlapping clinical presentation. Thus, to achieve maximal utility, 90 infectious disease surveillance systems should move beyond syndrome-based reporting and be pathogen-specific and comprehensive, reporting on as many of the common pathogens for a particular syndrome as possible. Sensitive and specific automated molecular diagnostic systems that detect up to four different pathogens in a single sample have been available from in vitro diagnostic (IVD) manufacturers for some time [31] [32] [33] . However adoption of IVD platforms with 95 broad multiplexing capability has become widespread only in the last few years. Commercially available systems that can detect most of the known etiological agents for respiratory, gastrointestinal and other multi-pathogen syndromes [34] [35] [36] include the BioFire (Salt Lake City, UT) FilmArray ® System [37] ; the GenMark (Carlsbad, CA) eSensor XT-8 ® [38] and ePlex ® [39] ; and the Luminex (Austin, TX) xTAG ® [40] , nxTag ® [41] and Verigene ® systems [42] . 100 Multi-analyte diagnostic tests provide the raw data needed for real-time pathogen-specific surveillance but there remain a number of obstacles to sharing these results (reviewed in [43] ).
The obstacles largely center on information privacy and network security. A real-time surveillance system using diagnostic test results requires safeguards for protected health 105 information (PHI). Medical records and devices have become attractive targets for cyber attackers in recent years [44] , which has made hospitals and clinics reluctant to connect their Local Area Networks (LANs) to the Internet. Releasing patient test results requires the removal of PHI or authorization from the patient. Studies have shown that de-identification of patient data is not as simple as removing all specific identifiers because, in the age of big data, under the right 110 circumstances it is possible to re-associate patients and their data using publicly available information [45] [46] [47] [48] .
We describe here the implementation of a real-time pathogen-specific surveillance system that overcomes the PHI concerns noted above. FilmArray Trend de-identifies, aggregates and exports test results from FilmArray Instruments in use in US clinical laboratories. Although data from all commercially available FilmArray Panels (Methods and [49] pathogens [37, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] .
With more than 344,000 patient results for the FilmArray RP test alone, the Trend database has 125 many of the properties associated with ""big data"" as it applies to infectious disease [57] . After describing how the dataset can be cleaned of non-patient tests, we make some observations on the seasonality of the different respiratory pathogens and we apply the ecological concept of ""species diversity"" [58] to observe a correlation between the abundance of each pathogen and the rate at which co-detections (more than one positive result per test) occur. 130 All rights reserved.

Trend information is to follow a ""Bottom-Out"" approach to data export ( Figure 1 ). In this scheme, the FilmArray Instrument sends data via the Internet directly to a single cloud database where it can be viewed by health care providers at the originating institution. This data export 140 pathway contrasts with a ""Top-Out"" approach ( Figure 1 ) in which diagnostic test results are pushed from the instrument up to the LIS, then to the HIS and, finally, a subset of this information is forwarded to cloud-based databases. 145 Bottom-Out and Top-Out approaches for data export are indicated by solid and dashed lines respectively.

The initial dataset provided low-resolution information but was a useful platform to evaluate the proposed system. Further development to enable export of higher resolution data required the design of routines that would adhere to an alternative HIPAA de-identification 155 strategy, namely, the Expert Determination approach, which requires a risk assessment demonstrating that the chance of re-identifying an individual is sufficiently small [60, 61] . The Expert Determination process identified and made recommendations for fields that could facilitate disclosure of PHI. A summary of the Expert Determination results detailing the risk of Trend data in regard to replicability, availability and distinguishability is shown in Methods, 160 Table 2 .
Because the Expert Determination study established that no PHI will be disclosed by the Trend data export algorithm, Data Use Agreements (DUA), rather than Business Associates Agreements (BAA, see Methods for the difference between a DUA and a BAA) were executed 165 with each of the collaborating institutions (listed in Table 3 ). The DUAs define for the clinical laboratory how BioFire will manage and make use of the Trend data. The Trend client software residing on the FilmArray computer queries the FilmArray test result local database and exports the results to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) database (see Methods). The Trend client software performs de-identification on the FilmArray computer prior to export as detailed in 170 Table 2 . Health care providers are granted access to their institutions' Trend data by the Laboratory Director. Since web access to view the data is restricted to the local site, deidentification of geographic indicators is not required. However, in implementation of the public Trend website, which presents the national syndromic test surveillance (Figure 1 ), we have further aggregated the data with respect to geographic origin and obfuscated the date of the test 8 (see Methods). Since only de-identified data are exported from the clinical institutions, no PHI is sent to or stored on the cloud server.
All sites submitted the Trend project for review by their local Institutional Review Board (IRB); all but one of the 20 IRBs deemed the project ""exempt"" because of the absence of PHI export. 180 Thus the security requirements for the database and the controls necessary for storage and transport of de-identified data are significantly reduced. The detection counts and pathogen detection rates derived from the Trend data set for each 225 organism in the FilmArray RP are shown in Figure 2 . Other views of these data, including The pathogens' seasonal variability measured by percent detection can be classified into at least three groups. Group 1: The majority of organisms follow the classical ""respiratory"" season 240 (October through March) and increase by more than 10-fold above their baseline detection rate ( Figure 2C ). These include the CoVs, Flu A, Flu B, hMPV, the PIVs, and RSV (PIV3 is a slight exception to this rule in that it peaks in the summer months, and has a winter peak that is only detected regionally (data not shown)). Within this group, all but five viruses demonstrate significant biennial fluctuations; Flu B, hMPV, OC43, and PIV3 and RSV experience relatively 245 consistent annual peaks. Group 2: HRV/EV is in a class by itself in that it is detected in a high percentage of tests over time, (minimum of 10% in winter) and experiences moderate peaks of two to three fold outside the respiratory season baseline, in the early fall and spring ( Figure 2D ).

These three properties allow for a novel evaluation of co-detections. The observed rates of co-detections should be influenced by the number of circulating pathogens detected by the FilmArray RP test at a particular site. Figure 5A shows the average number of unique organisms detected at each site in a given week (see Methods: Calculation of co-detection rates). This number fluctuates from a 295 summer low of four to a winter high of 11 pathogens. Figure 5B (grey bars) shows that the total rate of organism co-detections in the Trend dataset fluctuates annually with peak rates occurring in the winter months. The average rates have been as high as 12% in the winter of 2016 and as low as 2% in the summer of 2014. 300 From the Trend data, a Measure of Interspecific Encounter (MIE) can be calculated as the probability of a co-detection, weighted by the prevalence of each circulating pathogen at a site.

This article describes ""FilmArray Trend"", a new system for real-time reporting of widespread pathogen-specific syndromic data. This system already has many of the important properties of big data. We consider Trend in terms of the ""V""s that are often used to describe big data: volume (amount), velocity (speed of acquisition), veracity (accuracy), variety (diversity of information) 315 and value (utility) [57, 62] .
The Trend RP dataset is growing at an average rate of >200,000 pathogen test results per month.
Connecting the first 20 clinical sites has provided insight into the principal concerns that will be raised by the legal, IT and administrative departments of the healthcare providers that house 320 FilmArray instruments. It should be possible, therefore, to expand the Trend installed base by 10 to 20-fold over the next few years. Similarly, the existence of Trend should enable other IVD manufacturers to build their own Trend-like systems with greater acceptance on the part of their customers, thereby allowing a more global and comprehensive surveillance perspective.
The data in Figure 2 are similar to previous demonstrations of the seasonality associated with different respiratory viruses [63] [64] [65] [66] . What is novel is that this data is generated automatically, on site, and in close to real-time compared to other surveillance systems. Greater than 98% of the test results are exported to the Trend database within 24 hours of being generated. As part of the de-identification protocol, sequential FilmArray RP tests of the same type are put into the same 330 time bin. This has the effect that test results are exported faster during periods of peak use such as during the peak of the respiratory season or during an outbreak. Trend should be instrumental at a local level to determine the start of respiratory season; many hospitals make significant changes to their operations based on this event however, at present, data collection to track the respiratory season is often slow and manual, or semi-automated at best. 335 The key to implementing (Figure 3) , supporting the validity and utility of the Trend data. 380 A second source of concern in the Trend data set is a consequence of removal of sample identification such that we cannot directly determine whether the sample was from a patient or was a non-clinical sample (verification test, QC or PT) and should be removed from further epidemiological analysis. We estimate that non-patient testing makes up approximately 1.8% of the total FilmArray RP tests. Automated detection algorithms remove 3.5% of the total RP tests, 385 including approximately half of the non-clinical samples. With the exception of the four positive tests, the clinical samples removed by filtering should be a random sampling of all patient tests.
The remaining 1% fraction of non-patient tests have essentially no impact on the Trend evaluation of pathogen prevalence but they do make it more difficult to perform high resolution analysis of pathogen co-detections. This is especially true for co-detections of low prevalence 390 organisms where QC positives are likely to be more common than real positives. Future updates to the FilmArray software will simplify the process by which the instrument operator can tag tests of non-patient samples, thereby largely eliminating the need to filter such test results from the Trend database before analysis.
T r e n d V a r i e t y :
The total positivity rate of the FilmArray RP test varies from a low of 38% in the summer months to a high of 75% in December and January, with a yearly average of approximately 60%. Figure 5A shows that the average number of different circulating pathogens at a single institution can vary from eight up to 11 during the winter months. Even during the peak periods of ILI, many respiratory infections are due to other viruses ( Figure 2C ) that can present clinically in a 400 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Therefore, the presumption of an influenza infection based on reported influenza percent positivity, without diagnostic testing for the virus, can lead to the inappropriate use of anti-viral agents [70] . Conversely, without comprehensive testing, a negative influenza or RSV test can lead to prescription of an unnecessary antibiotic. FilmArray Trend data can be a valuable aid for antimicrobial stewardship programs because it provides real-time information 405 regarding the causes of respiratory infections and highlights the prevalence of viral infections.
As previously observed [66] , the viruses that share the winter seasonality of influenza demonstrate annual or biennial behavior. It is possible that the viruses that share an influenza- Detection of multiple respiratory viruses in the same patient has been reported before. In the 415 Trend dataset the rate of dual and triple co-detections was approximately 7.7 %, with HRV/EV as the organism most commonly observed in a co-detection. Some viruses, such as ADV and
CoVs are detected in a mixed infection more than 50% of the time (Figure 4 ). In principle a FilmArray RP positive result may represent detection of residual pathogen nucleic acid from a previous infection that has resolved. However, several studies suggest that coinfections are 420 associated with more severe disease ( [71] [72] [73] , see also discussion in [74] ). In such cases, information about multiple detections can provide infection control practitioners with data that can assist in bed management and in the assessment of risk for nosocomial infections in a patient population that has been segregated by the occurrence of a common pathogen. Such information can prevent the introduction of a new pathogen associated with cohorting patients during busy 425 respiratory seasons [75] [76] [77] .
The question of whether different respiratory pathogens interfere with, or facilitate, growth in a human host is of some interest and not well understood. With the right data it can be studied at the population [78] , individual [79] , and cellular level [74] . Because the Trend data still includes 430 All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/157156 doi: bioRxiv preprint some non-patient tests, we have chosen not to analyze every possible dual or triple infection individually. Rather we have taken a global approach and compared the overall rate of observed co-detections with MIE, which is a measure of the diversity of viruses circulating in a specific region and time period. MIE is similar, but not identical, to PIE (Probability of Interspecific Encounter [80] ), also referred to as the Gini-Simpson index (1-D, where D is the Simpson's 435 index [81, 82] ), which is used in ecology as a measure of the species diversity of a region.
Similarly, the circulating pathogen number of Figure 5A is identical to the Species Richness measure of ecology. We calculate MIE using frequencies (P i ) of pathogen positivity per FilmArray test and note that the sum of all pathogen frequencies can add up to more than 100% because of co-detections or be less than 100% because of the presence of negative tests. In this 440 regard, MIE differs from PIE because it is not a probability measure. infections at a rate that can be predicted by their observed abundance. Data however may be biased by the patient population tested and the type of respiratory disease. The data also does not rule out that there are particular respiratory pathogens that occur more or less often in mixed infections than predicted by their individual percent positivity rates. [74, 83] . As we improve our ability to remove non-patient test results from the Trend dataset we will be able to characterize 450 specific virus co-detection rates and their significance [65, 66, 78, 79, [84] [85] [86] .
T r e n d V a l u e
As with weather forecasting, there is both a theoretical and a practical interest in predicting the next few weeks or months of the respiratory season [87] [88] [89] [90] . FilmArray Trend contributes to infectious disease forecasting efforts because the data is timely and comprehensive. As the 455 number of sites participating in Trend increases it will be possible to localize the reported infections to smaller geographical regions. At a high enough density of Trend sites, patterns of movement of respiratory pathogens across the US will become visible in a way that has not been easily observed before now. Likewise, an increase in the normalized metric, concomitant with an increase in negative tests, may indicate the occurrence of an outbreak caused by an emerging pathogen.
Public health agencies (PHAs), which include local and state health departments and the CDC, 480 are specifically exempt under an HIPAA provision that allows clinical laboratories to disclose PHI to the PHA for specified public health purposes [91] . The exemption includes follow up studies on reportable infectious diseases. Real-time pathogen specific syndromic surveillance systems such as Trend will allow state PHAs to more rapidly identify, acquire, and test residual samples from potential outbreaks. Conversely, perceived ""outbreaks"" may actually be 485 coincidental multi-organism seasonal surges, and rapid analysis by Trend-like systems could prevent timely and costly outbreak investigation.

However, combining PHI with the diagnostic test result in the Top-Out approach makes these systems more complex and difficult to implement and may limit participation by health care institutions. Ironically, Bottom-Out data export systems have a role 495 to play in the development of Top-Out systems because Bottom-Out export provides a rapid and efficient means to quality check the data flowing from Top-Out systems. FilmArray Trend data could also be combined with data derived from other automated diagnostic platforms [92, 93] .
This work might best be accomplished by a third party that is viewed as independent and impartial. For example, in the case of data originating in the US, a federal institution or a private underappreciated pathogens, and clarify true disease epidemiology. Finally, systems like Trend will be essential for the rapid identification of disease anomalies indicating potential emergent outbreaks, thereby providing an independent tool for public health surveillance.

The goal of the Trend project is to provide a near real-time view of the changes in pathogen prevalence; therefore, it is important to be able to retrieve the date when a FilmArray test is 565 performed. However, retrieving the date conflicts with the Safe Harbor approach because the date of a test is PHI (the year of the test is not PHI but working with just the year defeats the purpose of tracking prevalence through the season). For this reason we followed the Expert Determination approach to manage data export. 570 The study took into consideration data that are available on participating clinical laboratory FilmArray Instruments, BioFire's own customer database, the proposed Trend database and publicly available data sources.

In accord with the recommended actions, information in the fields that may be used to 580 distinguish a patient is obfuscated (through truncation or binning) to ensure that a combination of these fields cannot be used to identify a specific patient [97] . For example, the time and date of the test are dynamically binned so that a minimum number of tests of one panel type are included in each bin prior to export. This ensures that a sufficient quantity of test results are uploaded to the database from one site at one time so that there is very low risk that patient identity can be 585 inferred from knowledge of the start time of the test.
If an adversary were to infiltrate the safeguards of the database, and wished to know specific patient test results from a specific location on a given day, no unique records would exist. The combination of deleting the sample identification (ID) field, binning the test date range, and 590 truncating the FilmArray pouch serial number ensures that the remaining information is never unique, which indicates that there is a low risk of misuse of data.

13bdc1078ca5091bfd346a4ecc5dacb6566480d9,"The rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations. This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19.
Recent studies has established that the motions explored by geometric simulation correspond well to the essential dynamics extracted from MD trajectories [4] ; that global flexible motions can couple to .","As of late 2019, there has been global concern over a novel respiratory disease (designated COVID-19 by the World Health Organisation (WHO)) which originated in the Wuhan region of China and has subsequently spread to multiple other countries worldwide. The virus causing COVID-19 is a coronavirus with the taxonomic identifier SARS-CoV-2 [1] . Thanks to the diligent efforts of structural biologists, several crystal structures of proteins from SARS-CoV-2 have already been obtained and made available through the Protein Data Bank (PDB) even in advance of journal publication.
Crystal structures provide us with detailed structural knowledge of the arrangement of atoms making up a protein or protein complex. A crystal structure is a static snapshot of the protein ""frozen"" into one of its many possible conformations. This static snapshot is rich in implicit information on the natural dynamics which the protein will explore in vivo. These natural dynamics, described by Kern [2] as a protein's ""dynamic personality"", can be critical to a protein's function, and can directly affect the geometry of, for example, an enzyme active site.
A judicious combination of simplified methodologiesrigidity analysis, elastic network modelling, and geometric simulation of flexible motioncan work together to extract valuable information on the large-amplitude, low-frequency motions of a protein structure, at a fraction of the computational cost (in resources and time) of molecular dynamics (MD) approaches [3] . These simplified methods are strongly complementary to both computational MD investigations and experimental biophysical/biochemical studies of protein behaviour. enzyme active site geometry [5] [6] [7] [8] ; and, crucially, that a structure generated from geometric simulation of a large amplitude motion can be used as input for further MD investigation [9] , as the geometric simulation retains the local bonding geometry and constraint network of the input crystal structure and forbids major bonding distortions and steric clashes.
The information obtained here regarding the flexibility of the enzyme should be of use and interest in structure-based drug design and computational screening of drugs and drug-like molecules capable of binding to and inhibiting the action of the viral protease, such as the pioneering work of Walsh et al. reported online within the past few days [10] . The simulations reported here suggest that the protease structure is capable of substantial flexible motions which alter domain orientations, open and close clefts, and affect the geometry of an inhibitor-binding site. The entirety of the computational work described here was carried out in less than one working day on a laptop computer. The inputs and outputs of the simulations, principally consisting of PDB files representing flexible variations on the protease crystal structures, are available for download from the University of Bath research data archive at https://researchdata.bath.ac.uk/772/ [11] with DOI https://doi.org/10.15125/BATH-00772
Methods, software and data Input data: crystal structures of a viral protease were downloaded from PDB entries 6Y2E (free protease) and 6LU7 (inhibitor bound).
Visualisations: visualisation and some minor structural editing, viz. generation of symmetry copies, removal of water and other heterogroups, removal of alternate sidechain conformations, and renumbering of entries after addition of hydrogens, were carried out with the PyMOL viewer, version 0.99 [12] . All structures were aligned to the 6Y2E crystal structure for consistency of view.
Addition of hydrogens, sidechain flipping: the MolProbity [13] web server hosted at Duke University provides online tools carrying out these functions.
Rigidity analysis: carried out using the pebble-game constraint counting algorithm implemented in the software FIRST [14] . FIRST should be available from Arizona State University via flexweb.asu.edu; academic readers should contact the present author if there is difficulty in obtaining the software, as the site appears currently to be down. Recent research has shown that the assignment of energies to polar interactions in FIRST suffers from a bug that leads to some salt-bridge interactions with short donoracceptor distances being treated as weak rather than strong. Therefore, interactions were identified and energies assigned using a recently developed corrected function, SBFIRST [15] . A copy of the SBFIRST software for constraint identification is included with the deposited dataset for this study.
Normal mode analysis: carried out using the Elnemo elastic network modelling software [16] . This method builds an elastic network model of the protein with one site per residue (using the alpha carbon _CA_ atom coordinates as the node positions), placing springs of uniform strength between each pair of residues lying less than 10 Å apart, and diagonalising the resulting Hessian matrix to identify eigenvectors.
Geometric simulations of flexible motion: carried out using the FRODA geometric simulation engine [17] incorporated into FIRST. The FRODA engine iteratively projects an all-atom model of the protein structure along a normal mode direction [3] while constraining the local geometry to match that of the original protein structure. Frames along each such trajectory are written out as numbered PDB files.
Workflow and protocol: for each protein structure, the complete workflow for this study is as follows. Download structure in PDB or mmCIF format. In this case, the downloaded structure contains coordinates for a single protein chain, and symmetry operations to generate copies making up the crystal structure.
Visualise structure in PyMOL. Generate symmetry mates. Select the appropriate symmetry mate to make up the homodimer indicated in the PDB entry (under Global Stoichiometry) as the biological entity of interest. Delete other symmetry copies. Alter chain ID(s) in the symmetry copy to give each chain a unique chain ID.
Process structure through the MolProbity website, adding hydrogens at electron-cloud positions, accepting all recommendations for side chain flips. Download the hydrogenated structure (in which all hydrogens have a serial number of 0).
Visualise structure in PyMOL for final cleaning and preparation. Remove alternate conformations (i.e. those with an altloc entry which is not a blank or an A). Remove water molecules and extraneous heterogroups such as glycerol, acetyl etc. Save the cleaned structure; in this step, PyMOL renumbers the atoms sequentially, so hydrogens now have appropriate serial numbers.
Identify covalent and noncovalent interactions from the atomic geometry of the protein structure using SBFIRST. This generates lists of covalent bonds, tagged as being either rotatable or non-rotatable (such as the C-N bond in the peptide main chain); hydrophobic tether interactions, wherever two nonpolar sidechains are closely adjacent; and polar interactions, including salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Polar interactions are assigned energies between 0 and -10 kcal/mol based on the donor-hydrogen-acceptor geometry.
Analyse rigidity with FIRST as a function of hydrogen-bond energy cutoff. This analysis groups atoms into rigid clusters by matching degrees of freedom against constraints. FIRST can carry out a dilution, gradually lowering the cutoff to exclude polar interactions one by one from weakest to strongest. It is also possible to simply carry out ""snapshots"" of the rigidity at a series of cutoff values, which in this study were -0.0, -0.5, -1.0 … -3.5, -4.0 kcal/mol.
Review constraints based on rigidity information. At this stage, a small number of noncovalent constraints (one in 6Y2E, three in 6LU7) were identifiable as artefacts of crystal packing, and were excluded from the network when carrying out the geometric simulations. Based on the rigidity analysis, a cutoff of -3.0 kcal/mol appeared appropriate for the geometric simulations, in line with previous studies [4, 5] .
Normal mode analysis. Extract only the alpha carbon positions and run Elnemo pdbmat (generation of matrix) and diagstd (diagonalise matrix) functions. The result is a series of normal modes of motion, reported as eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs. When these are sorted by eigenvalue from lowest to highest, the first six modes are trivial rigid-body motions with near-zero eigenvalues (frequencies), while the low-frequency modes from 7 upwards represent flexible motions of the protein itself. This study examines modes 7 to 16, that is, the ten lowest-frequency nontrivial modes, with modes 7 to 12 being shown in the figures.
Geometric simulation of flexible motion. For each normal mode of interest (7 to 16), run FIRST with a chosen energy cutoff (-3.0 kcal/mol) and the previously identified lists of covalent and noncovalent bonding constraints, providing the normal mode eigenvector and a direction of motion (parallel or antiparallel to the vector) along with a directed step size (in this case 0.01Å), and invoking the FRODA engine implemented in FIRST. FRODA carries out a series of steps. In each step, all atom positions are moved along the normal mode direction. Then, the local atomic geometry defined by the bonding constraints and steric exclusion is restored by a few cycles of iterative relaxation. After a userdefined number of steps (in this case 100), a numbered ""frame"" is written out as a PDB file. A series of such frames describes the trajectory of flexible motion. FRODA continues each run until a user-defined maximum number of steps (in this case 1500) or until ""jamming"" occurs where the constraints can no longer be satisfied, typically when the motion has led to severe steric clashes through the collision of two domains.
Output data: the inputs, scripts and outputs of the rigidity analysis, normal mode analysis, and geometric simulations for each protein have been deposited in the University of Bath's data repository and are accessible from https://researchdata.bath.ac.uk/772/ [11] Results and discussion
The 6Y2E and 6LU7 crystal structures each contain explicit coordinates for one chain (A) of the protease, and in the case of 6LU7, a chain (C) representing a bound inhibitor. The input structures for analysis and simulation consist of chain A and a symmetry copy (B), making up the biological homodimer. Chain C is likewise duplicated to chain D. The X-ray structure does not contain explicit hydrogens, which are added using MolProbity [13] . With hydrogens added, it is then possible to detect the covalent bonds, polar noncovalent interactions (hydrogen bonds and salt bridges) and hydrophobictether interactions using SBFIRST [15] (see Methods). The polar interactions are rated with an effective energy between 0 and -10 kcal/mol based on the donor-hydrogen-acceptor geometry.
Pebble-game rigidity analysis [14, 18] divides the structure into rigid clusters and flexible regions based on the distribution of degrees of freedom and constraints. This rigid cluster decomposition (RCD) depends on the set of polar interactions that are included, based on an energy cutoff that excludes weaker interactions. Information on the relative stability of different portions of the structure is typically obtained at cutoffs around a ""room temperature"" value of -1 kcal/mol. RCDs are shown in Figure 1 . With the inclusion of weaker polar constraints, a single large rigid cluster extends across both chains of the protease dimer. As weaker constraints are eliminated, the large cluster extends across the N-terminal domains (roughly residues 1-200) of both chains, which consist largely of beta-sheet structure, while the largely alpha-helical C-terminal domain breaks up into several smaller rigid clusters, each one a single helix. With further elimination of constraints, the beta-sheet regions become fully flexible. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.986190 doi: bioRxiv preprint Flexible motion of a protein structure is best carried out at with a rigidity cutoff such that the structure is fully flexible. The mobility studies that follow are carried out with a cutoff of -3.0 kcal/mol, similar to previous studies on enzymes [4, 5] . It is important to appreciate that even at this lower cutoff the structure is still thoroughly constrained by noncovalent interactions, as illustrated in Figure 2 . The core of each folded domain is rich in hydrophobic interactions, as is the interface region between the two beta-sheet domains as the two chains form the homodimer, and arrays of strong polar interactions constrain secondary structure (for example, the backbone hydrogen bonds within alpha helices and beta sheets).
Noncovalent constraints in the 6LU7 structure, shown as green (hydrophobic) and red (polar) lines. The protein mainchain is shown in cartoon representation. The circled area highlights a small set of interdomain hydrophobic constraints, one between the ALA 285 residues of the two chains, and one each between residue THR 280 of one chain and LEU 286 of the other. In the 6Y2E structure only the ALA 285 interaction is present. These interactions may be considered an artefact of crystal packing.
Also highlighted in Figure 2 are a small set of hydrophobic interactions assigned between the N-terminal domains of chains A and B. In the 6Y2E structure, a single tether connects the sidechains of the ALA 285 residues of both chains. In the 6LU7 structure illustrated, there are two additional tethers nearby, each connecting the sidechains of the THR 280 residue of one chain and the LEU 286 of the other. Since the two N-terminal domains are otherwise not connected by noncovalent interactions, and these tethers are not involved in forming a rigid cluster, it seems reasonable to consider these tethers an artefact of crystal packing, and eliminate them from further consideration. Their deletion does not affect the rigid cluster decompositions of the structures. If these tethers were retained, they would somewhat limit (but not entirely prevent) the central cleft-opening motion discussed below.
Normal modes, representing directions of motion intrinsic to the structure, are easily obtained from an elastic network model [16] (see Methods) in which the protein is represented as one site per residue and springs of uniform strength are placed between every pair of sites with a separation less than 10 Å. In the 6LU7 structure, the amino acid residues of the bound inhibitor are included in the elastic network. Of the 3N normal modes of a structure with N residues, six modes of near-zero frequency represent the trivial rigid body motions of the structure, while the low-frequency modes from 7 upwards represent modes of flexible motion. When the structure moves along a low-frequency mode direction, the global geometry changes with minimal change in the local geometry, making these directions of ""easy"" motion for the protein. The sign of a normal mode eigenvector is arbitrary; motions parallel and antiparallel to each bias direction must be investigated equally.
Linear projection of a protein structure along a normal mode direction would rapidly introduce unphysical distortions into the structure. The geometric simulation approach implemented in FRODA [3, 17] instead applies a bias, moving the structure along a normal mode direction, while maintaining steric exclusion and the bonding geometry and noncovalent constraints of the input structure. This approach rapidly generates physically realistic flexible variations on the input structure which retain all-atom steric and bonding detail.
Geometric simulations of the lowest-frequency nontrivial modes of motion (7 upwards) show that the protease structure is capable of substantial amplitudes of easy motion covering several Ångstroms distance in global root-mean-square displacement (RMSD). In particular, the orientations of the alphahelical domains relative to the beta-sheet domains can change through flexing and rotation about the interdomain ""hinges"", and the beta-sheet domains themselves are large enough to display bending and twisting motions within themselves. These variations are illustrated for the 6Y2E structure in Figure 3 and for 6LU7 in Figure 4 . , shown in cartoon representation and coloured from blue to red along each chain. Each flexible variation is the 1000 th frame of a geometric simulation, lying at an all-atom RMSD of 3 to 4 Ångstroms from the starting crystal structure. Note the substantial variations of domain orientation achieved. Each variation is labelled with the normal mode used to bias the geometric simulation, from 7 to 12, and with the direction of bias, parallel (+) or antiparallel (-) to the mode eigenvector, whose sign is arbitrary.

Flexible variations on a protein crystal structure are potentially relevant to structure-based drug design in at least two ways. Firstly, flexible motion can open or expose clefts and potential binding sites not directly visible in the static crystal structure. Since the protein in vivo will be exploring its flexible motion thanks to the Brownian-motion driving force of its solvent (e.g. cytosol), such latent sites may constitute valid target areas for inhibitors.
Secondly, the global low-frequency motion couples to variations in the binding site/active site geometry [5, 6] . Knowledge of the range of flexible variation here is potentially useful for structurebased drug design and/or fragment screening, since attention can be focussed on candidate molecules that interact robustly with the binding site and tolerate its flexibility, in preference to molecules that interact well only with the crystal structure and not with its flexible variations. 6Y2E crystal structure (a) and cleft opening motion along modes 9-(b) and 11+(c).

A more detailed view of this opening cleft is shown in Figure 6 . The residues are coloured to bring out the chemical character of the amino acid side chains. The portions of the alpha-helical domain surfaces that move aside to open the cleft display largely hydrophobic residues (aliphatic or aromatic side chains). Intriguingly, the exposed surface area within the cleft is richly lined with a series of basic residues (lysine and arginine), and is flanked by acidic (aspartic and glutamic acids) and polar (threonine) residues. In the crystal structures the basic and acidic residues appear to be involved in a network of inter-and intra-domain salt bridge interactions which stabilise the core of the homodimer. An antagonist capable of targeting this zone of strongly polar surface geometry exposed by flexible motion could potentially disrupt the dynamics of the enzyme and interfere with its function.

In the 6LU7 structure, a binding site on the flank of each beta-sheet domain is occupied by the inhibitor N-((5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl)alanyl-L-valyl-N~1~-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-(((3R)-2oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)methyl)but-2-enyl)-L-leucinamide (chain C of the structure), hereinafter ""N3"". This inhibitor is listed in the PDB as PRD_002214; it is a peptide-like inhibitor, with a central core of amino acids modified at either end with heterogroups, and was previously known to inhibit a protease of a feline coronavirus [19] (see PDB entry 5EU8). In the 6Y2E structure the same binding cleft is empty, which means that its geometry is likely to change in the course of flexible motion of the beta-sheet domain. Figure 7 shows the N3 binding site of the 6LU7 structure and the corresponding region of the 6Y2E structure. As noted, all structures have been aligned to the 6Y2E crystal structure for ease of viewing and comparison.

Motion biased antiparallel to the mode eigenvector (7-) includes an opening of the cleft, while motion biased parallel to it (7+) closes it. Since the N3 inhibitor is quite deeply embedded in the binding site of the 6LU7 structure, opening and closing of this cleft in the course of the protein's natural motion may be necessary for molecules to access the cleft. On visual inspection, the site in the 6Y2E structure is clearly slightly more closed that in 6LU7, consistent with the proposition that such opening/closing motions are intrinsic to the protein.

Sialic acids (Sia) are widely displayed on the surfaces of cells and tissues. Sia come in 21 a variety of chemically modified forms, including those with acetyl modifications at the 22 C7, C8, and C9 positions. Here, we analyzed the distribution and amounts of these 23 acetyl modifications in different human and canine cells. As Sia or their variant forms 24 are receptors for influenza A and influenza C viruses, we examined the effects of these 25 modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl 26 modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and 27 canines. While they were expressed on the cell surface of canine MDCK cell lines, they 28 were located primarily within the Golgi compartment of human HEK-293 and A549 cells. 29
The O-acetyl modified Sia were expressed at low levels of 1-2% of total Sia in these cell 30 lines. We knocked out and over-expressed the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene 31 (CasD1), and knocked out the sialate O-acetylesterase gene (SIAE) using 32 CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Knocking out CasD1 removed 7,9-O-and 9-O-acetyl Sia 33 expression, confirming previous reports. However, over-expression of CasD1 and 34 knockout of SIAE gave only modest increases in 9-O-acetyl levels in cells and no 35 change in 7,9-O-acetyl levels, indicating that there are complex regulations of these 36 modifications. These modifications were essential for influenza C infection, but had no 37 obvious effect on influenza A infection. 38","4 from which it has been observed to migrate to the C8 and C9 position under 66 physiological conditions, allowing the possible addition of another acetyl group to C7 (6, 67 7). A migrase enzyme has been proposed to aid in the transfer of the acetyl group from 68 C7 to C9, however a specific enzyme has yet to be identified (5, 8, 9) . CasD1 is 69 localized in the late Golgi, so acetyl modifications are added during the later stages of 70 protein glycosylation. The regulatory processes that control the number of acetyl groups 71 added or their positions have not been well defined, although clear differences in 72 expression of 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac have been reported in mouse and human tissues, 73 chicken embryos, and some other animals (10, 11). CasD1 uses acetyl-CoA and likely 74 has a preference for CMP-Neu5Ac as a substrate, so that it is less active on CMP-75 Neu5Gc (7). The existence of an enzyme to facilitate the migration of acetyl groups from 76 C7 has been proposed, but not identified (5). 77
At least one sialate O-acetylesterase (SIAE) enzyme regulates the display of 7, O-and 9-O-Ac in many cells and tissues (Fig. 1B) . The SIAE gene encodes two 79 isoforms that vary in the presence of a proposed C-terminal localization tag in the 80 lysosomal (Lse) form that is absent from the cytosolic form (Cse) (12). However, the 81 processes that regulate the expression and activity of these two isoforms remain poorly 82 defined. Lse has been found to localize to the Golgi and/or ER and on the surface of 83 cells when over-expressed, with the majority being secreted into the supernatant (12). 84
Antibody staining shows that Cse is found diffusely throughout the cytosol, where it is 85 thought to remove 9-O-and 7-O-acetyl groups to recycle the Sia for reuse in 86 glycosylation (12).

Here we examine and more closely define the expression and distribution of 9-O-128 acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl Sia on cells in culture, define the effects of SIAE and CasD1 on 129 display of these Sia modifications, and perform an initial examination of the effects of 130 these modified Sia on infection by IAV and ICV. We used CRISPR-Cas9 for gene O-Ac, while BCoV HE-Fc recognizes primarily 7,9-O-Ac but also has a low affinity for 9-150 O-Ac (10, 11).

MDCK-type II cells showed staining only for 9-O-Ac and none for 7, O-Ac, indicating that these modifications are regulated independently. In HEK-293 and 157 All rights reserved.

This agrees with previous findings that loss of CasD1 leads to loss of both 204 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac modifications in haploid HAP1 cells (7). HPLC analysis of total Sia 205 showed a significant decrease in 9-O-Ac expression compared to wild-type (WT) cells, 206 however very low levels (<1%) were still detectable, despite a lack of staining with the 207 HE-Fc probes (Fig. 4E) . This could be due to exogenous Sia from the fetal bovine 208 serum in the growth media, as is the case for Neu5Gc which is also detectable at 209 similarly low levels on cells even though the gene for Neu5Gc synthesis, CMAH, is not 210 functional in humans or canines (Supplemental showed significantly higher levels of CasD1 mRNA compared to WT cells, indicating 218 that the CasD1 expression plasmid was being transcribed at high levels ( Fig. 4E) . 219
However, only a modest increase in average 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac expression across the 220 population in HEK-293 cells was seen by flow cytometry, while fluorescent microscopy 221 showed heterogeneity of expression in the population (Fig. 4B, C, D) . The transfected 222 MDCK and A549 CasD1-OX cells showed recovery of 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac synthesis 223 when analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, but levels were 224 not as high as seen in WT cells (Fig. 4B, C, D) .

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/650341 doi: bioRxiv preprint heterogeneity was still seen in these populations for 9-O-Ac. This suggests that 7,9-O-227 and 9-O-Ac expression is not directly regulated by the levels of CasD1 gene expression, 228 but may be affected by post-translational regulation of CasD1 activity or removal of the 229 modifications by SIAE or other enzymes. In addition, these modifications are not 230 regulated the same across individual cells as evidenced by the population 231 heterogeneity. SIAE transcripts were seen to be consistently expressed in HEK-293 232 WT, ΔCasD1, and CasD1-OX cell populations by qPCR analysis, although SIAE mRNA 233 levels in CasD1-OX cells were lower than those seen in WT (Fig. 4E) . 234
To determine the role of 235 SIAE activity in regulating 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac display, SIAE knockout (ΔSIAE) cells were 236 generated from WT HEK-293 and A549 cells by targeting early exons in the SIAE gene 237 (Fig. 5A) . Complete knockout of SIAE was confirmed both by genotyping to show 238 deletions in both alleles and by loss of mRNA by qPCR (Fig. 5A, D) . ΔSIAE cells 239
showed a small but significant increase in surface display and a large increase in 240 internal display of 9-O-Ac based on flow cytometry, but did not appear to show any 241 changes in surface or internal display of 7,9-O-Ac (Fig. 5B, C) . HPLC analysis also 242 showed a small increase of 9-O-Ac in HEK-293 cells, but no 7,9-O-Ac was detected in 243 either cell line (Fig. 5E) . When the overexpression CasD1 plasmid was transfected into 244 ΔSIAE cells (ΔSIAE+CasD1), cells showed an increase in surface and internal 9-O-Ac, 245 but no increase in surface or internal display of 7,9-O-Ac by either flow cytometry or 246 immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5B,C) . HPLC confirmed the flow cytometry 247 results by showing a small increase of 9-O-Ac levels in HEK-293 cells that were similar 248 to those seen in CasD1-OX (Figs. 5E) .

Interestingly, HEK-293 250 ΔSIAE+CasD1 cells grew more slowly than either ΔSIAE or WT cells (Fig. 5F) . 251
However, A549 ΔSIAE+CasD1 showed increased growth rates compared to ΔSIAE or 252 WT cells, while ΔSIAE cells had slightly lower growth rates compared to WT. This 253 suggests that 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac may affect cell metabolism and growth rates, and that 254 these effects may be cell type specific. Overall, these results show that SIAE regulates 255 in infection efficiency in any of these cells (Fig. 6A) . IAV strains also showed equal 265 infection efficiency on MDCK WT, ΔCasD1, and CasD1-OX (Fig. 6C) . However, ICV 266 strains C/Ann Arbor/1/50 and C/Taylor/1233/1947 showed no infectivity in MDCK 267 ΔCasD1 (Fig. 6B) . Only the Ann Arbor strain recovered infectivity in MDCK CasD1-OX 268 at much lower levels than in MDCK WT, likely due to the lower surface expression of 9-269 O-and 7,9-O-Ac in these cells. It therefore appears that 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac do not 270 strongly influence IAV infection, likely due to their low levels of expression. However, 271

14220553c9160c06bb99f59d59e6a8ecf3595226,"COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations.
We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality.
The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%.
School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools.

Evidence before this study COVID-19 is affecting many countries around the world. Multiple countries, states, and school districts are employing school closures as a non-pharmaceutical social distancing strategy. Support for school closures mostly comes from models and experience with influenza. Few studies explicitly consider the tradeoff between case reduction and disease burden with the potential loss of healthcare workers to child care obligations. We found only two studies that attempted to quantify the potential child care burden of school closures for healthcare workers. These analyses were coarse, and no studies have explicitly considered the tradeoff between reduced transmission and healthcare labor's role in cumulative mortality.
Using current detailed data from the US Current Population Survey, we quantify the exposure of the US healthcare sector, occupations within the healthcare sector, and individual US states to unmet child care obligations for US healthcare workers in the event of a school closure. These obligations could compromise the ability of the US healthcare system to respond to COVID-19. We identify the parameter space where school closure could lead to a greater number of deaths from COVID-19 through healthcare labor force reductions. We find that the current best estimates of healthcare worker likely absenteeism to provide child care in the event of school closures imply great uncertainty to whether school closures will ultimately reduce COVID-19 mortality.
Targeted pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 are likely months away. However, supportive measures by healthcare providers are important. Social distancing, including school closures, can limit COVID-19 cases. However, the evidence that the potential transmission reduction benefits of mandatory school closures exceed the costs of potentially imposing greater child care obligations on healthcare workers, thereby reducing the healthcare workforce, is not overwhelming. We provide the first explicit analysis of the school closure tradeoff between case reduction and labor force impact on patient survival probability. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker loss by 17.6% for school closures to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection probability of survival cannot increase by more than 2.4%; otherwise, school closures will lead reduce patient survival. Even if the only objective is to save lives, there is still a tradeoff associated with closing schools due to potential losses in healthcare labor force capacity.
Covid-19's global spread is triggering a range of public health responses. School closures are some of the highest-profile social distancing measures employed to slow the spread of an infectious disease. Japan recently instituted a nationwide school closure, which drew a swift response from families scrambling to make alternative childcare arrangements. South Korea, Italy, and some US school districts have closed schools. School closures prevent contacts among children and reduce cases. But, there is a downside to closing schools, even if the only goal is saving lives during an epidemic. Closing schools can inadvertently cause child care shortages that strain the healthcare system. Lempel et al. estimated that the child care obligations associated with school closure could reduce key medical personnel by 6-19%. 1 Here, we use the recent years (2018-2020) of the US Current Population Survey to estimate the school closure induced child care obligations for the US healthcare labor force. Approximately 29% of US households with a healthcare worker have at least one school-aged child age 3-12, who requires child care. Child care obligations are especially high and relatively inflexible in households where a parent is a nurse or medical assistant. Understanding these tradeoffs are important in planning the public health response to COVID-19, because if the survival of infected patients is sufficiently sensitive to declines in the healthcare labor force, then school closures could increase deaths.
The benefit from closing schools during an epidemic is to reduce transmission and new cases. Cauchemez et al. estimated that extended school closures in France could reduce H5N1 influenza cases by 13-17%. 2 Bayham et al. show that schools are likely places for transmission among US children. 3 However, Bayham et al. also show voluntary behavioral changes, without mandatory shutdowns, appeared to reduce cases of the 2009 H1N1 influenza on the order of 10-13%. In a systematic review, focused on influenza and school closures, Jackson et al. find some evidence that school closures are effective, but that the empirical evidence does not resolve how or when to close schools. 4 Furthermore, they find school closure mostly reduces infection in school children. Koh et al. do not find strong evidence that school closures prevent the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease. 5 Adda finds that while school closures do reduce incidence in France, the economic costs are large. 6 The benefits of school closure are often estimated relative to a baseline of no voluntary changes in behavior, but it is likely that the correct baseline for forcasting the school closure effect on COVID-19 includes other voluntary behavioral changes.
The potential benefits of school closures must be balanced with the costs. Smith et al., Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond, and Adda analyze the economic impacts of school closures. 1, 6, 7 Schooling is one of the most important investments we make in our children's futures, and we do not have good estimates of how prolonged school closures influence drop-out rates and future earnings. This uncertainty makes a holistic assessment of tradeoffs challenging.
Setting aside the economic costs and focusing on reducing mortality, school closures still create a tradeoff. Many healthcare workers must reduce time spent providing patient care, running diagnostic tests, and tracing contacts, and increase time caring for their own children. This tradeoff should not be ignored because the capacity to care for infected individuals and trace contacts directly influences the development of an epidemic, the survival of infected patients, and ultimately cummulative mortality from the pathogen.
First, we highlight two pathways school closure can effect pathogen induced mortality. School closures, , can affect mortality via (1) reduction in cases and (2) a reduction in the healthcare labor force that treats sick patients and prevents mortality. While no pharmaceutical treatment is available, supportive measures are still important for patient survival. Define cumulative mortality as 
where is the baseline mortality fraction for cases, / is the percent increase in the case mortality rate through the reduction in healthcare labor force from a school closure ( 0) , and / is the percent decrease in cumulative cases from the school closure. If there are no school closures, 0, then ⁄ 0. This implies mortality is . This model highlights the tradeoff between the case-reducing effect of school closures and the cost in terms of lost healthcare labor supply.
Analyzing the net effect of school closures on mortality requires estimation of three factors that are not part of canonical epidemiological models. 8, 9 The first term is , which is the effect of school closure on the healthcare labor force and is between zero and one. The second term is , which is a first-order approximation of the life-saving (mortality-reducing) effect of healthcare providers on the probability of a patient dying from disease or disease-related complications. The third term is / , which is the reduction in cases associated with a school closure.
The first term, , is rarely calculated. Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond provide a preliminary estimate for school closures in the US of a 6-19% reduction in the healthcare workforce. 1 To provide detailed estimates, we use data from the US Current Population Survey (CPS) to quantify the impact of school closures on healthcare labor supply, . The CPS is an ongoing monthly survey of approximately 60,000 US households jointly administered by the US Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. We access the data via the Integrated Public Use Microdata. 10 We use the recent dataset, which includes information on just over 3 million individuals spread across 1.25 million households between January 2018-2020. The detailed data in the CPS allows us to characterize the family structure and likely withinhousehold childcare options for healthcare workers. It also enables us to describe the exposure to child care obligations for specific occupations within healthcare and across states. We calculate the share of healthcare provider households that are single parent, where a parent is defined to include head of household, opposite or same-sex spouse, partner or roommate, and an opposite or same-sex unmarried partner. We use the personal CPS sample weights for all calculations to ensure that the estimates are nationally representative.
The second term, , is calculated in development contexts and in emergency medicine, but to our knowledge has not been measured for accute infectious diseases (e.g., influenza or COVID-19) or included explicitly in epidemiological models. It is useful to know the critical value of where school closure stops saving lives and starts increasing mortality, which is defined by the condition
Imposing condition (2) as a strict equality and rearranging yields , when exceeds this value, then more lives are lost from school closures than saved. 1 is the maximum percent increase in the mortality rate that does not reverse lives saved from school closures. is a more inutive quantity, and it also provides a number that is invariant to .
The epidemiological literature has focused on the final term, / . This value is usually determined by adjusting the conditional infectivity, either parametrically or through a behavioral model within an epidemiological model to account for a school closure. 11 Models are required because there is little unconfounded experience with school closures during an epidemic, and few analyses of any behavior All rights reserved.

We focus on the midpoint of this estimate, 0.15, but consider cumlative case reductions from school closures between 0 and 50%.
Twenty-nine percent of healthcare worker households have an obligation to care for a child between 3 and 12 years of age. Focusing on households without a non-working adult or sibling 13 years or older who could potentially care for children ages 3-12 (https://www.redcross.org/take-aclass/babysitting/babysitting-child-care-training/babysitting-certification), we find that 15% or slightly more than 1 in 7, healthcare worker households have child care obligations. This may be optimistic because non-working adults may not be able to provide care, e.g., they may require care themselves. On the other hand, it is possible that family members outside the household, neighbors, or friends could care for children, though no data are available in the CPS on these possibilities. We find that 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households, which is greater than all other major industry classifications.
Within the healthcare sector, there are critical professions that are even more exposed to child care obligations (Table 1) . These include households with a nurse, psychiatric, and home health care aids, nurse practitioner, medical assistant, nurse anesthetist, diagnostics technologist, physician's assistant, or physician and surgeon. Assuming that non-working adults or siblings 13 or older can meet the child care obligations, 22% of nurse practitioners, 21% of physician's assistants, 19% of diagnostic technicians, 18% of medical assistants, 16% of physicians and surgeons, and 13% of nursing, psychiatric, and home healthcare aids would still have unmet child care obligations. This is just over 20% of the healthcare workforce.
School closures may be especially challenging for single parents. 14.7% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides are single parents. Medical assistants (10.5%) and licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses (9.7%) are also more likely to be single parents than the healthcare average. Together this is 30% of the healthcare workforce, and is the segment most likely to be providing infection control for the elderly in nursing homes and other facilities.
Registered nursing is the most common profession in the healthcare field and accounts for 29.5% of the healthcare labor force, followed by nursing, psychiatric, and home health care aides (18.8%). 28% of registered nurses have child care obligations, but perhaps 13% of registered nurses can meet these obligations with a non-working adult or older sibling, leaving 15% with unmet child care obligations. Five percent of registered nurses are single parents, but this varies from state to state (Figure 1 ).
The exposure of the healthcare labor force to school closures is not homogeneous throughout the US (Appendix Table 1 ). How a policy trade-off plays out in one place may be different than another even if two locations experience a similar set of COVID-19 cases. That is, different places may have similar projected benefits from school closures, but different costs. The greatest share of the healthcare labor force with child care obligations is in Utah (35%), Louisiana (35%), and Missouri (34%), whereas the healthcare labor force in Washington DC (16%), Vermont (21%), and Massachusetts (24%) have the least child care obligations. However, household structures also vary. Therefore, if childcare obligations can be met by a non-working adult or older sibling, then South Dakota (21%), Oregon (20%), and Missouri (20%) are the most exposed states to school closure induced healthcare worker shortages. Washington DC (9%), New Mexico (10%), and New Jersey (11%) may be most able to cover their child care obligations. Louisiana (12%), Mississippi (11%), and Pennsylvania (10%) have the greatest fraction of single-parent healthcare worker households. These differences are likely an interaction of variations in state-level healthcare regulation, cultural, and demographic differences. This requires state and local health officials to consider the exposure of their own state (data available at https://github.com/jbayham/us_childcare_obligations) or region.
Using the data on child care obligations provides a first estimate of potential reductions in the healthcare labor force during a school closure. This estimate can be combined with projections of the case reductions from school closures to identify the parameter space where estimates of 1 are important to inform whether school closures would reduce net mortality (Figure 2 ). If the is large, then the increase percent increase in the mortality rate is below , and closing schools saves lives. This is the case when school closures lead to many avoided cases, and few healthcare workforce effects. Conversely, if is near zero, then then it is likely that the percent increase in mortality exceeds and school closure increases the cumulative mortality. This is the case if the school closure reduces the labor force substantially but provides a relatively small reduction in cumulative cases. There is a band where 0 ≪ ≪ ∞, where whether or not closing schools saves lives depends on the value of , which is unknown.
For the United States, and for most states within the US, the is not sufficently higher or lower to know which way a school closure will turnout without more information on . Consider an example that uses Cauchemez et al.'s (2008) estimate of a reduciton of cases of 15% from a school closure and assume baseline mortality to COVID-19 of 2%. Assume an epidemiological forcast without a school closure predicts 16,000 cases (about a 1/5 th of the cases currently reported in China), which implies 320 deaths (Italy has already reported 463 deaths with 9,172 cases). The school closure reduces cases to 13,600. The for this scenario is 0.176, with an associate 0.024. Therefore, the mortality rate after the closure must rise to at least 2.35% as a result of the 15% loss in the healthcare workforce in order to undo the benefits of school closures. This implies the percent increase in patient survival by avoiding a 15% reduction in the health workforce, an elasticity measuring healthcare worker ""prodcutivity,"" is 0.024. This means that doubling the healthcare workforce must not save more than 2.4% more patients or school closures could lead to more deaths. However, there is substantial variation across the country. For example, in South Dakota this elasticity is 1.7%, wheres in Washington DC it is 4.1%.
An additional concern could be timing within an epidemic. School closure could spread out cases so as not to overwhelm the healthcare system. Cauchemez et al. estimates a reduction in peak prevalence of about 42%. This cannot raise the mortality per case in that period to less than 3.4% or an elasiticity of 9.9% for school closure to save lives.
What we know about social distancing policies is based largely on models of influenza, 4,13 where children are a vulnerable group. However, preliminary data on COVID-19 suggests that children are a small fraction of cases and may be less vulnerable than older adults. 14 If these early results hold-up, then the already uncertain transmission reduction benefits from school closures will be reduced relative to influenza. Conversely, school closures may be implemented earlier in COVID-19 outbreaks, which may lead to greater levels of prevented cases. Furthermore, school closures may lead to other adults staying home, which could reduce cases. These are all important questions when considering school closures.
School closures do expose the healthcare labor force to increased child care obligations, likely reducing support for infected individuals, which is critical. We also do not know how much a reduction in the healthcare labor force, and in what occupations within healthcare, decreases the probability of COVID-19 patient survival. We do know that the segment of the healthcare work force most responsible for infection control in nursing homes is likely to be among the most highly impacted by school closure induced child care obligations. Given our reasonable estimates of case reductions from school closures, a measure of the increased mortality risk to COVID-19 patients from healthcare absenteeism to care for children is a critical, and to date unknown parameter. This analysis does not include non-COVID-19 mortality that could occur from other conditions if the US healthcare work force is reduced, but risk to these patients should also be considered when deciding about school closings.
Minimizing the impact of the COVID-19 and saving lives requires clear thinking and weighing tradeoffs. There will likely be cases when closing schools is sensible. However, policymakers and the healthcare experts advising them need to understand that closing schools may have severe knock-on effects on the healthcare system and that there is substantial uncertainty about the effectiveness of school closures for preventing infection beyond school children and on the impact of reduction in the healthcare workforce on patient survival. In the United States, the healthcare system appears disproportionately exposed to school closure induced labor shortages, and the segment of that system that provides infection control in nursing homes even more so. Such potential healthcare workforce labor shortages should be a first-order consideration when considering the potential benefits and costs of school closures.

A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083).
However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039].

The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 to prevent and treat VT in medical staff and GP are extremely necessary.","Since December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan has infected more than 70,000 individuals. China has taken active and effective actions to provide medical support for aiding in the control of the rapid spread of COVID-19. From January 24, 2020 (Chinese New Year's Eve), China has sent more than 30,000 medical staff to Wuhan city and Hubei province to provide medical support. Researchers have validated that these efficient and feasible strategies and measures are timely and effective. Medical staffs often have a variety of psychological problems under a high-pressure and risk anti-pandemic situation. 1 Therefore, psychological assessment and intervention in victims and rescuers, such as medical staff and volunteers, are of great importance for the control of large-scale disasters and pandemics. This notion is not only beneficial for early actions and measures for psychological intervention, but also for tremendously improving disaster and pandemic control and rapid social recovery. 2 In 1996, Saakvitne and Pearlman first proposed vicarious traumatization (VT). 3 The term initially referred to the phenomenon where professional psychotherapists are involuntarily affected by the bidirectional interactions of the relationship between consultation and interview due to long-term contact with patients with mental diseases.
In other words, psychotherapists experienced mental symptoms similar to psychological trauma. 4 Currently, the scope of application of VT is extended to a large number of cruel and destructive disasters, where the degree of damage exceeds psychological and emotional tolerance and indirectly leads to various psychological abnormalities. 5 These psychological abnormalities are derived from sympathy for survivors of a trauma, which causes serious physical and mental distress, even mental breakdown. 6 The main symptoms of VT such as anorexia, fatigue, physical decline, sleep disorder, irritability, inattention, numbness, fear, and despair are well recognized to be experienced by all individuals. Frequently, these symptoms are accompanied by trauma responses and interpersonal conflicts that even compel others to commit suicide. 7 In this regard, the study proposes that medical staff, volunteers, and the GP will more or less experience VT during the spread and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, identifying and providing intervention for VT at an early stage is important.
In this study, 214 GP and 526 nurses (i.e., 234 front-line nurses (FLNs) and 292 non-front-line nurses (nFLNs)), were employed and evaluated via the Chinese version of the VT evaluation scale. In addition, risk factors finally leading to VT among medical staff were evaluated. Therefore, our findings can likely provide theoretical basis and viable strategies for early psychological interventions during COVID-19 control.
The study is descriptive in nature, utilizes a mobile phone app-based questionnaire survey, and was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic from February 17, 2020
to Feb 21, 2020 (i.e., five weekdays). The Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University approved the study (approval number:

The study employed licensed registered nurses who worked in hospitals and GP (non-medical staff). Owing to the fact that the investigation was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the current isolation policy calls for reduced face-to-face contact and communication and avoidance of large gatherings and activities. Therefore, an anonymous questionnaire was structured using a mobile app called ""Sojump"" (www.sojump.com) and pushed to individuals via WeChat after obtaining informed consent. Finally, a total of 740 individuals (i.e., 526 nurses and 214 GP), filled in the questionnaire.
Demographic data included gender, age, hospital classification, years of working, departments, professional titles, undertaking management work or not, educational background, marriage status, single child or not, and fertile or not. The Chinese version of the VT questionnaire was compiled based on qualitative interviews with rescuers in the Wenchuan earthquake in China and existing international trauma-related scales, such as the Traumatic Stress Institute Belief Scale, Impact of Event Scale, and Vicarious Trauma Scale. [8] [9] [10] The VT questionnaire adopted in the current study has a total of 38 items, which are composed of two dimensions, namely, physiological responses (11 items) and psychological responses [i.e., emotional responses (nine items), behavioral responses (seven items), cognitive responses (five items), and life belief (six items)]. Each question score ranged from 0 (never) to 5 (always). The higher the score, the more serious the VT. Cranach's alpha for the questionnaire reached 0.93, whereas that for each dimension ranged from 0.73 to 0.92.
The cumulative variance contribution rate reached 52.56%, which indicates positive reliability and validity.
The study presented continuous and normally distributed variables as means and standard error of mean. The independent sample t-test was used to assess group differences. Abnormally distributed data were described using the median and interquartile range (IQR: 25%-75%), whereas the Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used to assess group differences. Descriptive statistics involved frequencies (%) for categorical variables, and the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to assess group differences. The independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test was adopted to compare variables between FLNs and nFLNs. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors associated with the VT of nFLNs. Results were presented as OR and 95% CIs. Data were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Co. LTD, Chicago, IL, USA).

In the study, a total of 526 nurses, which consist of 234 FLNs and 292 nFLNs, were enrolled. Results showed a statistical difference in hospital classification (P < 0.001), departments (P < 0.001), professional titles (P = 0.044), single child or not (P < 0.001), and fertile or not (P = 0.024) between FLNs and nFLNs ( Table 4) . were separately compared and showed significantly lower VT scores in FLNs than those in the GP and nFLN groups (P < 0.001).

Results showed that gender (OR = 3.117; 95% CI = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002) and marriage status (OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039) are risk factors for VT of nFLNs ( Table 6 ).
The results showed that FLNs, nFLNs and the GP have experienced VT under the situation of the spread of COVID-19. However, the severity of VT in the three groups remains relatively differential. The study found that the level of VT in the GP was significantly higher than of nurses, including FLNs and nFLNs. Notably, although no significant differences were observed between the severity of VT in the nFLNs and the GP, its severity was significantly higher than that of the FLNs who came in close contact with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, the occurrence of psychological problems in front-line medical staff is likely, whereas the mental health of non-front-line medical staff and the GP should not be ignored. In addition, the study found that the severity of VT in nFLNs was more serious, whereas that of married and divorced or widowed nurses were higher than that of unmarried nurses. Most nurses are female, such that VT was more serious in female FLNs that that of male FLNs.
These results suggest that female nurses with a marriage history are more likely to suffer from psychological disorders, which may be related to the fact that women are more sensitive to trauma 11, 12 , and those with marriage history are largely older than those without marriage history. Interestingly, however, the study failed to find a correlation between age and increase in VT severity in nurses.

Although the severity of VT in the GP is higher than that of the medical staff, the study must emphasize that no difference was observed in the scores of physiological responses of VT between the two groups. A significant difference was noted for psychological responses, which consist of behavioral responses, emotional responses, and life beliefs. This finding may be highly related to the fact that China has adopted a strict isolation policy to deal with the epidemic, thus calling on the public to reduce face-to-face contact and communication to reduce the probability of viral transmission.
During this period of COVID-19 proliferation, most of the GP stay at home for isolation. Thus, they gained more time to gather knowledge about the epidemic and the lives of other people, especially those of patients with COVID-19, through the Internet and media. 13 The GP not only felt sympathy for patients with COVID-19, but are also excessively concerned about the medical staff. Importantly, the GP have no medical background and lack sufficient cognitive ability to increase awareness of the COVID-19 outbreak. In the issue of public health, psychological endurance is lacking.
This notion suggests that during the spread and control of COVID-19, propaganda strategies should be well-organized and effective. In addition, early intervention measures should be taken to alleviate the psychological problems of the GP. 14 The tendency of the severity of mental disorders to change over time has been widely reported. 15, 16 Thus, the current study also verified this feature. FLNs with different working periods have different levels of VT severity. That is, the longer the support time, the more serious the alternative trauma. Although the difference fails to .

show statistical significance, it shows an increase trend. This finding may be highly related to the extension of working periods, where the medical staff consult with more patients with different processes of disease and varying degree of suffering. Under the long-term high-pressure and stress condition in fighting against the epidemic, their psychological defense will be negatively affected 17 , which can lead to increased VT severity. Therefore, adopting various levels of interventions for FLNs with VT is necessary during the diverse stages of medical support missions.
Results of the analysis indicate that the FLNs mainly originated from 3A and 3B hospitals (China's hospital classification) and from critical care medicine and internal medicine departments. This group is mainly composed of middle-level backbone members, where most of them are single children and have not given birth. Close contact with patients with COVID-19 and direct exposure to the patients' physical and psychological sufferings have been well recognized to render FLNs prone to suffer from VT; therefore, the society and psychotherapists should actively pay more attention to the psychological problems of FLNs. 18,19 However, the results of the study imply that the VT severity of nFLNs, regardless of physical or psychological responses, is more serious than that of FLNs. This finding suggests that nFLNs are more likely to suffer from psychological problems, whereas the psychological endurance of FLNs is stronger. This notion may be due to the fact that FLNs are voluntarily selected and provided with sufficient psychological preparation. Second, the selected FLNs are mainly middle-level backbone staff with working experience and psychological capacity. In addition, the VT of FLNs is typically derived from .

Finally, the FLNs are more knowledgeable about the epidemic than the GP and nFLNs. Therefore, a transparent announcement of epidemic information is very beneficial to social and psychological constructs and psychological intervention at a later time. 20 Collectively, the abovementioned factors may be possible reasons for the higher severity of VT in nFLNs than in FLNs.
The study has certain limitations. First, the observational objects are mainly nurses. The reason for this option is that the proportion of nurses in the medical teams for COVID-19 control constitutes more than 70%, such that investigating nurses is representative. Secondly, this study is a descriptive cross-sectional one, which is unable to explore the causal linkage between factors. Therefore, carrying out a longitudinal large-sized intervention study and enrolling clinical doctors and other medical workers, such as technicians, is necessary to further explore the pathogenesis, therapeutic strategies, and mechanisms of VT.
In summary, the results suggest that the GP and medical staff suffer from VT.
However, the VT of non-front-line medical staff is more serious than that of front-line medical staff. Therefore, early intervention of VT and psychological stress for the GP and medical staff, as well as the transparent announcement of epidemic information can facilitate the psychological treatment and control of COVID-19.

Early detection of imported cases is critical for containment of the virus. Based on air travel volume estimates from Wuhan to international destinations and using a generalized linear regression model we identify locations which may potentially have undetected internationally imported cases.
A novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has been identified with the first confirmed patient cases in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, China. Since then the number of confirmed cases has increased drastically. Model estimates suggested that by Jan 25, 2020 there were a total of over 75,000 infected cases with a doubling time of about 6 days 1 . By the end of January 2020, city-wide lockdowns were implemented for Wuhan and neighbouring cities. Nonetheless, the virus has managed to spread from Wuhan to other Chinese cities and also outside of China. As of Feb 4, 2020, cases outside China were being reported in 23 different locations of which 22 locations had imported cases (Spain reported one case but due to secondary transmission) 2 .
The majority of these cases have been linked to a recent travel history from China 2 , suggesting that air travel may play an important role for the risk of cases being exported outside of China.

Here we use estimates of air travel volume from Wuhan to international destinations in 49 locations expected to be proficient at detecting imported cases based on having a high Global Health Security (GHS) Index 3 , and a generalised linear regression model to predict imports of 2019-nCoV cases across 191 locations. Using these predictions we can identify locations that might not be identifying imported cases.
Under a model fit to data from destinations with high surveillance capacity, we sought to identify locations that report fewer than predicted imported cases of 2019-nCoV. Specifically, for 49 locations with The model requires three types of data: data on imported cases of 2019-nCoV, data on daily air travel volume, and data on surveillance capacity. Data on imported cases aggregated by destination were obtained from the WHO technical report dated 4th February 2020 2 (a zero case count was assumed for all locations not listed). We used case counts up to the 4th February, because after this date the number of exported cases from Hubei drops rapidly 2 , likely due to the Hubei-wide lockdowns. We defined imported cases as those with known travel history from China (of those, 83% had travel history from Hubei province, and 17% from unknown locations in China 2 ). We excluded cases that are likely due to transmission outside of China or whose transmission source is still under investigation 2 . In addition, we excluded from our Specifically, we use the Early Detection and Reporting Epidemics of Potential International Concern component of the Index 3 , henceforth referred to as simply the GHS index, and define high surveillance locations as those whose GHS index is greater than the 75th quantile. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020495 doi: medRxiv preprint
The model is as follows. We assumed that across the n =49 high surveillance locations the case counts follow a Poisson distribution, and that the expected case count is linearly proportional to the daily air travel volume:
where C i denotes the reported case count in the i -th location, λ i denotes the expected case count in the i -th location, β denotes the regression coefficient, x i denotes the daily air travel volume of the i -th location.
The model was fitted in R (version 3.6.1) 5 to compute , the maximum likelihood estimate of β, and β ︿ thus the expected case count given high surveillance (Figure 1, solid grey line) . We also computed the excluding Thailand from the model fit since it is a high-leverage point. In total, we thus did six additional regression analyses (see Supplementary Figure 1 ). All analyses are fully reproducible given code available online ( https://github.com/c2-d2/cov19flightimport ).
Imported case counts of 2019-nCoV among high surveillance locations are positively correlated with daily air travel volume (Figure 1 ). An increase in flight volume by 14 passengers per day is associated with one additional imported case in expectation. Singapore lies above the 95% prediction interval (PI),
with 12 (2-13) more reported import cases than expected under our model. Thailand has a relatively high air travel volume as compared to all other locations, yet it lies below the 95% prediction interval. Finally, Indonesia with zero reported cases lies below the prediction interval -its expected case count is 5 (1-11 .

We aimed to identify locations with underdetected cases by fitting a model to the cumulative international imported case counts of nCoV-2019 reported by high surveillance locations and Wuhan-to-location air travel volume. Our model can be adjusted to account for exportation of cases from locations other than Wuhan as the outbreak develops and more information on importations and self-sustained transmission becomes available. One key advantage of this model is that it does not rely on estimates of incidence or prevalence in the epicentre of the outbreak. Based on our model, locations whose case counts exceed the 95% prediction interval (PI) could be interpreted as having higher case-detection capacity and/or more connection with Wuhan than that captured by available daily air travel volume, such as land transportation. Locations below the 95% PI may have undetected cases based on the expected case count under high surveillance. We recommend that outbreak surveillance and control efforts for potential local transmission should be rapidly strengthened in those locations lying below the 95% PI lower bound, in particular Indonesia, to ensure detection of cases and appropriate control measures to reduce the risk of self-sustained transmission.",,medrxiv,10.1101/2020.02.04.20020495,,,medrvix,2020-02-05,Pablo M De Salazar; Rene Niehus; Aimee Taylor; Caroline O Buckee; Marc Lipsitch,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv

Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was 38 collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on 39 the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups 40 were analyzed. 41
Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two 42 groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, 43 respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK 44 cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild 45 group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than 46 severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and 47 cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, 48 IL-6 and IL-10. 49
Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels 50
were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for 51 predicting the transition from mild to severe.

Considering that the value of IL-6 changed most in the mild and severe groups, the correlation 148 between the lymphocyte subsets and the cytokine IL-6 was analyzed. The data with IL-6 value of 0 149 in each group (57 cases in light group and 3 cases in severe group) were excluded, and 45 cases in 150 the mild group and 18 cases in severe group were included in the correlation analysis. As shown in 151 Table 3 , the correlation analysis between IL-6 and lymphocyte subsets showed that the Pearson 152 correlation coefficients of IL-6 and CD4 + T, CD8 + T, B cell, NK cell, CD4 + T / CD8 + T were 153 very low, and there was no significant linear correlation. 154

The data (57 cases of IL-6 and 3 cases of IFN in the mild group) with the index value of 0 in 157 the two groups were excluded. Two independent-samples t test was performed on the lymphocyte 158 subsets and cytokines of the mild group and the severe group, with α= 0.05 as the inspection level. 159
Significant differences were observed in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 between the mild group 160 and the severe group (P < 0.05), while no significant difference was detected in B cell, NK cell, 161
CD4 + T / CD8 + T, IL-4, IL-17, TNF, IFN between the two groups (P > 0.05, Table 4 ). 162
Lymphocyte subsets play an important role in the body's cellular immune regulation, and each 164 cell restricts and regulates each other. This study found that among NCP patients, the reduction rate 165 of CD4 + T accounted for 52.90% in the mild group, and 95.24% in the severe group; the reduction 166 rate of CD8 + T accounted for 28.40% in the mild group, and 61.90% in the severe group, indicating 167 that T lymphocytes were more inhibited in severe patients when the body is resistant to 2019-nCoV 168
infection. This was consistent with the research conclusions of Huabiao Chen 2 in SARS coronavirus, 169 revealing that the body responds in the same way when coping with homologous coronavirus 170 infection. The reduction ratio of B cell was 25.49% and 28.57% in the mild group and the severe 171 group, respectively, with no significant difference. The reduction ratio of NK cells accounted for 172 34.31% in the mild group and 47.62% in the severe group, which suggested that 2019-nCoV 173 infection limited the activity of NK cells to a certain extent, and in view of the fact that immune 174 adjuvant IL-2 can improve the activity of NK cells, the above research results may provide new 175 .

The results of this study suggested that there was no significant linear correlation between 193 lymphocyte subsets and cytokines. By analyzing the differences of lymphocyte subsets and 194 cytokines in peripheral blood between the mild and severe patients, we found that only CD4 + T, 195 CD8 + T, IL-6, IL-10 had statistical significance between the mild and severe groups, suggesting 196 that the immunosuppression of severe patients with 2019-nCoV infection was more obvious, which 197 was consistent with the opinions of many experts. 5, 6 For several results of this study, for example, 198 the proportion of patients with an IL-6 value of 0 in the mild group was as high as 55.88%, there 199 was no significant difference in terms of IL-17, TNF, IFN, and IL-4 between the two groups of is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This study has several limitations. Firstly, as the largest diagnosis and treatment center for 207 patients with NCP in Chongqing area, our hospital has more than 123 patients so far. The sample 208
size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some 209 impact on the statistical results. But on the whole, the number of patients in this area was in the 210 middle level for other parts of the country except Wuhan, and the research results were relatively 211 reliable. Secondly, the humoral immunity level of the included patients was not monitored, so there 212 was a certain deficiency in the evaluation of the immune system. Thirdly, due to the large-scale 213 outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank 214
In future studies, data will be collected from healthy patients as blank controls to further 216 explore the predictive value of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines for patients with 217
2019-nCoV infection. At the same time, we will cooperate with other designated treatment units to 218 carry out multicenter research to include more confirmed 2019-nCoV infected patients, expand the 219 sample size, and design more rigorous randomized controlled trials. In addition, we will strengthen 220 the follow-up of patients who are cured and discharged, and regularly detect the patient's peripheral 221 blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines.

15bad8368522a05f32dee771e5a8259f0e9cbbfd,"The COVID-19 disease has plagued over 110 countries and has resulted in over 4,000 deaths within 10 weeks. We compare the interaction between the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to SARS-CoV. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition. We postulate that the versatility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications on therapeutic strategies.
One Sentence Summary: Molecular dynamics simulations reveal a temporal dimension of coronaviruses interactions with the host receptor.","To gain access to host cells, coronaviruses rely on spike proteins, which are membrane-anchored trimers containing a receptor-binding S1 segment and a membrane-fusion S2 segment (6) . The S1 segment contains a receptor binding domain (RBD) that recognizes and binds to a host cell receptor. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the critical receptor for mediating SARS-2002 entry into host cells (7, 8) . Binding of the spike protein to the receptor is a critical phase where the levels of the ACE2 expressed on the cell membrane correlates with viral infectivity, and govern clinical outcomes (9) . Consistent with the clinical pulmonary manifestation, ACE2 is widely expressed in almost all tissues, with the highest expression levels in the epithelium of the lung (10) . Similar to the SARS-2002 virus, the COVID-19 virus enters the host cell by RBD binding to the host cell ACE2 receptor (7, 11, 12) . Host receptor recognition for cell entry is, however, not specified by the CoV genus classification. MERS-CoV is a member of the BCoV genus but does not recognize the ACE2 receptor. In contrast, HCoV-NL63 is a member of the ACoV genus and does recognize the ACE2 receptor (13) . Herein, we analyze the binding of several CoV RBDs to ACE2 with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and compare the stability, relative interaction strength, and dynamics of the interaction between the viral spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor.
The COVID-19 RBD (residues 319-529) shares a 72.8% sequence identity and high structural similarity with the SARS-2002 RBD ( Table 1 ). In contrast, the RBD of HCoV-NL63 is only 17.1% identical to that of COVID-19 and there are no significant structural similarities between them (Fig. S1) . Remarkably, the RBD of MERS-CoV, which is structurally similar to that of COVID-19 (20.1% sequence identity, 65% structure similarity) recognizes a different host receptor (DPP4) for its cell entry and does not bind ACE2 (14) . We ran 100ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of ACE2 in complex with the RBDs of the COVID-19, SARS-2002, and HCoV-NL63 viruses to quantify the energetics and the dynamics of the different RBD-ACE2 interactions. The simulation trajectory snapshots at 10 ps intervals (10,000 frames) were analyzed by a statistical potential to assess the probability of the RBD-ACE2 interaction (SOAP score, (16)), with lower values corresponding to higher probabilities and thus higher affinities. The interaction scores for COVID-19 RBD-ACE2 were comparable to those of SARS-2002, median of -1865.9 and -1929.5, respectively (Fig. 1A) . HCoV-NL63 has RBD-ACE2 interaction scores are higher than both of the SARS-CoVs (median of -941.6). MERS, which is structurally similar to COVID-19 (Table 1) does not bind ACE2. MERS virus which binds dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as CD26 (14)), has RBD-ACE2 interaction scores that indicate extremely weak affinity (median of -692.6), as expected from a non-cognate receptor interaction. COVID-19 has the largest buried surface area at the interface (1204Å 2 ), followed by the interface area for SARS-2002 (998Å 2 ) and HCoV-NL63 (973Å 2 ). The number of ACE2 contacting residues maintains the same order, with 30, 24, and 23 for COVID-19, SARS-2002, and HCoV-NL63, respectively (Fig. 1C) . The three RBDs exploit specific binding sites on ACE2 based on the analysis of the MD trajectories ( Fig. 1 , C and D; Movie S1). There is a significant overlap of ACE2 interacting residues between COVID-19 and SARS-2002 (at least 73%), while HCoV-NL63 shares only 17% and 36% of contacts with SARS-2002 and COVID-19, respectively. These findings suggest that the coronaviruses exert different interaction strategies with their cognate receptors to achieve the affinity that is required for effective cell entry. An ACE2 residue is considered as part of the interface if one of its atoms is within 4Å from any RBD atom in at least 10% of the 10,000 MD simulation frames. (D) Overlay of 50 snapshots for each of the three RBDs. The ACE2 is in surface representation (gray). The frames were aligned using the N-terminal fragment of ACE2 that contains the two helices participating in the RBDs binding.
While the sequence identity between the RBDs of COVID-19 and SARS-2002 is 73% (Table 1) , we observe a significantly higher residue substitution rate at the interaction interface with the ACE2 receptor. Out of 29 RBD interface residues, only 10 residues (34%) in COVID-19 are conserved with respect to SARS-2002 ( Fig. 2A, Table S1, Fig. S1 ). Similarly, only 12 residues (40%) in SARS-2002 are conserved with respect to COVID-19.
To investigate these interface residues, we construct and overlay the contact maps for the RBD-ACE2 interfaces for COVID-19 and SARS-2002 (Fig. 2B) . We define a residue-residue contact frequency (CF) as the fraction of MD trajectory frames in which the contact appears.
Remarkably, only 8 out of the total 72 residue-residue interface contacts have comparable (<50% difference) contact frequencies between the COVID-19-ACE2 and SARS-2002-ACE2 interfaces ( Fig. 2B , colored gray). Furthermore, we find two interaction patches unique to COVID-19 ( The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.986398 doi: bioRxiv preprint
To investigate the dynamics of COVID-19 binding compared to SARS-2002, we calculate the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of each residue with respect to the lowest energy snapshot from their respective 100ns MD simulation trajectory. The interface region in the RBD contains two loops (loop1: residues 474-489, loop2: residues 498-505; using COVID-19 numbering, Fig.  3D ) that bind to the ACE2 N-terminal helix on both of its ends. These two loops are highly flexible in the SARS-2002 RBD (Fig. 3, A and D) . While loop1 is also fluctuating in the COVID-19 RBD, albeit much less, loop2 remains relatively rigid in the COVID-19 RBD. In addition, we find that in the COVID-19-RBD, a region centered around K417 leads to further stability relative to the corresponding region in SARS-2002. We attribute this difference to the unique interaction of COVID-19 at position K417 with the middle of the N-terminal ACE2 helix, thus serving as an anchor site to the receptor (Fig. 2C and Fig. 3A) . The contribution of K417 to ACE2 binding is observed in a recent cryoEM structure of the COVID-19 spike protein bound to ACE2 (17) . Overall, COVID-19 is more rigid compared to SARS-2002 (Fig. 3, A and D) .
We investigate the dynamics of a designed SARS (SARS-des) variant (11) Table S1 ). The L486F mutation is of special interest for the COVID-19 RBD as well because it has this same substitution. Our MD simulation analysis reveals that the SARS-des has a substantially lower interaction scores with ACE2 (median of -2199.2, Fig. S2) , as expected for an optimized human ACE2-binding RBD design. We observed that these two mutations not only enhance the binding affinity to ACE2, but also lead to a substantial stabilization of the interaction interface. The fluctuation signatures along the RBD of SARS-des are surprisingly similar to those recorded for COVID-19 (Fig. 3, B and C) . Thus, the switch from a flexible binding mode (for SARS-2002) to a stable one (COVID-19 and SARSdes, Fig. 3B ) highlights the remarkable capacity of the RBD to adopt alternative receptor binding strategies driven by a minimal number of amino acid substitutions. This analysis reveals the critical role of L486F (SARS-des residue F472) for stabilizing the COVID-19-ACE2 interface and a reduction in the number of states of the COVID-19 spike protein bound to an ACE2 receptor.
Experimental affinity measurements (e.g. surface plasmon resonance, SPR) confirm the high affinity of SARS-2002 RBD-ACE2 binding, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of ~15 mM (18) (19) (20) (21) , similar to the binding affinity of ACE2 and the COVID-19 RBD (22, 23) . Our MD based calculation is consistent with SARS-2002 displaying a similar but slightly higher affinity relative to COVID-19 (Fig. 1A, Fig. S2 and Table S2 ). Binding affinity is achieved through a combination of interface contact optimization and protein stability (Fig. 3E) . While the RBD-ACE2 complex can be resolved at high-resolution by cryo-EM (17, 23) , MD simulations provide orthogonal information about the interaction dynamics on a nanosecond timescale. In the case of CoVs, MD simulations reveal an exceptional versatility of viral receptor binding strategies (Fig. 3E) . COVID-19 adopted a different strategy for achieving comparable affinity to SARS-2002: the interface of COVID-19 is significantly larger than that of SARS-2002 (1204Å vs. 998Å) with a remarkable number of interacting residues (ACE2: 30 vs. 24, Fig. 1C) . In contrast, SARS-2002 is more flexible in its interaction with ACE2, interacting through fewer contacts that serve as ""hot spots"". Therefore, we predict that SARS-2002 RBD neutralizing antibodies will not be effective for COVID-19. The failure of several of these antibodies to neutralize the binding of COVID-19 RBD to its receptor is consistent with our findings (20, 23) . The fluctuation from high-to low-affinity conformations in SARS-2002 leads to an increased . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

This implies a therapeutic challenge is attributed to the enhanced rigidity of the COVID-19 RBD relative to that of the SARS-2002. The geometric and physicochemical properties of RBD-ACE2 interfaces resemble those of antibody-antigen interactions. In both cases the interface benefits from long loop plasticity, bulky aromatic side chains as anchoring sites, and the stabilization of the complex by distributed .

Both COVID-19 and SARS-2002 interfaces contain long flexible loops and nine aromatic residues (Tyr, Trp, Phe) in the interface with ACE2 ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, in the SARS designed variant (SARS-des (11)), the addition of an aromatic residue (L486F substitution) significantly improved the interaction scores and interface stability (Fig. 3,  B and D) . Our findings shed light on the accelerated evolution of spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor similar to the rapid evolution along the antibody-antigen affinity maturation process.
The structural model of the COVID-19 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in complex with ACE2 was generated by comparative modeling using Modeller 9.18 (27) with the COVID-19 sequence (RefSeq: YP_009724390.1). We relied on the crystal structure of the spike protein receptor-binding domain from a SARS coronavirus designed human strain complexed with the human receptor ACE2 (PDB 3SCI, resolution 2.9Å) as a template for comparative modeling. The SARS-2002 spike protein RBD and HCoV-NL63 in complex with ACE2 were taken from PDB 2AJF (resolution 2.9Å) and 3KBH (resolution 3.3Å), respectively. Missing residues were added in MODELLER. MERS RBD structure was taken from the complex with the neutralizing antibody CDC2-C2 (PDB 6C6Z, resolution 2.1Å) and structurally aligned onto SARS-2002 RBD in complex with ACE2 receptor. The designed variant is from PDB 3SCI.
The MD simulations were performed with GROMACS 2020 software (28) using the CHARMM36m force field (29) . Each of the complexes was solvated in transferable intermolecular potential with 3 points (TIP3P) water molecules and ions were added to equalize the total system charge. The steepest descent algorithm was used for initial energy minimization until the system converged at Fmax < 1,000 kJ/(mol · nm). Then water and ions were allowed to equilibrate around the protein in a two-step equilibration process. The first part of equilibration was at a constant number of particles, volume, and temperature (NVT). The second part of equilibration was at a constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature (NPT). For both MD equilibration parts, positional restraints of k = 1,000 kJ/(mol · nm 2 ) were applied to heavy atoms of the protein, and the system was allowed to equilibrate at a reference temperature of 300 K, or reference pressure of 1 bar for 100 ps at a time step of 2 fs. Following equilibration, the production simulation duration was 100 nanoseconds with 2 fs time intervals. Altogether 10,000 frames were saved for the analysis at intervals of 10 ps. We superimposed several MD snapshots on the recently submitted to the PDB x-ray structure (6VW1, resolution 2.7Å) of COVID-19-ACE2 complex. The average RMSD over the interface Ca atoms is ~1Å. Interaction scores between the virus spike RBD and ACE2 were calculated for each frame of the trajectory using the SOAP statistical potential (16) . In the interface contact analysis, a residue-residue contact was defined based on the inter-atomic distance, with a cutoff of 4Å.

We found that the public trusted the CDC director to lead the COVID-19 response with trust in the public health/scientific leadership being high. Responsive, open, and respectful communication with the US population by these agencies may improve public health compliance and safety. 3 Furthermore, although participants reported relatively low risk perception, many supported restrictive policies for infection prevention. A portion of the sample also supported temporary discrimination based on someone's country of origin. These responses are concerning, and preemptive targeted messaging by the public health agencies is required to ensure a compassionate response to this outbreak. Our findings may be influenced by possible selection bias because participants needed a CloudResearch account and access to smartphone/computer to participate. However, our sample was fairly representative of the general adult US population. A weighted analysis based on age and gender demonstrate that our results are generalizable to national population ( Table 2) . Data for weighted analysis were extracted from US Census data. 6

160ecaaa5a766c289fc2f6b5499f0dfe7aab971c,"Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23 rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xi'an. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of ""resumption of work"", show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10 th and February 4 th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.","Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses, with a spherical shape and crown-like spines, from which their name derives. They generally cause mild respiratory infections but can sometimes be fatal. Since their first discovery and molecular characterization, three major spread out globally [2 ,6, 8, 11] , causing approximately 80,000 cases and 2,400 deaths as of February 22 nd 2020 [13] .
Since January 23 rd 2020, the Chinese authorities have been implementing unprecedented and increasingly stringent public health interventions, including a complete lock-down of Wuhan and neighboring cities, strict contact tracing and travel restrictions in the epicenter and across the country [13] . Incorporating these interventions into the classical epidemic models has resulted in reliable estimates of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 transmission in the epicenter and accurate near-casting the epidemic trend and peak time [18] [19] [20] , in comparison with other earlier modeling studies focusing on analyzing the transmission risk based on data at the early outbreak stage [1, 3, 4, 17] . One important lesson gained from our recent experience suggests the need of updating the model parameters and model setting to reflect the rapid improvement of screening, diagnosing and testing techniques/procedures, accompanied by intensive contact tracing, quarantine and isolation.
The feasibility of enhancing model capacity to assess transmission risk and evaluating intervention effectiveness has also been substantially increased due to the improvement of the quality of the data, specially from other Chinese cities and provinces where the complete lock-down of major cities such as Wuhan in the Hubei province has prevented a significant portion of infection importation, so the reduction of imported cases coupled with intensive contact tracing produced some high quality data with rather complete information on symptom onset time and transmission-chain, as will be discussed in the data section below. This enhanced model capacity for near-casting is particularly important, since the gradually relaxing of the travel restriction demands proactive-and real-time assessment of the risk of a potential second outbreak in other Chinese cities. An objective of our study is to provide this assessment, and to use this assessment along with the incorporation of feasible public health interventions into our stochastic disease transmission model to suggest the scale of interventions for these cities to prevent a second outbreak. As COVID-19 spread has occurred in many regions globally, we believe our study provides an important tool to inform public health decisions regarding travel restriction and social distancing in these regions according to their public health capacity to maintain an effective contact tracing, quarantine and isolation procedure.
In order to achieve the above research objectives, we examine the transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in other areas outside Hubei province and quantify the risk of case importation into the current outbreak which is expected to end soon, and into a potential secondary outbreak due to the ""resumption of work"" in these areas. We focus on the effectiveness and implementation timeliness of prevention and control strategies, as well as the choice of timing for the ""resumption of work"" and its impact on the risk of a secondary outbreak.
Our analysis is based on the complete ""tracking and recording"" information of imported cases and local cases detected in the province of Shaanxi province [7] , as this allows us to generate a data set that includes the time series of daily latent, infected and hospitalized cases. Since the outbreak scale in the Province of Shanxi was relatively small and this is subject to stochasticity in both case importation and local cases generated by the importation and since the Provincial data has detailed information on symptom onset and serial intervals, we adopt a method developed by Nishiura and Chowell [15, 16] to estimate the effective reproduction number, and we revise some of our early deterministic models to a novel discrete stochastic model to address the key issues relevant to preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19 in other provinces except for Hubei, due to the anticipated gradually relaxing of travel restriction and returning to normal social and economic activities.
We obtained the data of laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCov cases in Shaanxi province from the ""National Health Commission"" of the People's Republic of China and the ""Health Commission"" of the Shaanxi Province [7, 13] . It is worth mentioning that very detailed data information for each confirmed case has been released. This strict contact tracing strategy gave detailed information of illness onset, the first medical visit, quarantined period and confirmation. Then the data do not only include numbers, such as the number of newly reported cases, the cumulative number of reported confirmed cases, the cumulative number of cured cases and the number of death cases, and the cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases (shown in Figure 1(A) ), but also include the information such as the dates of illness onset, first medical visit, isolation, laboratory confirmation and discharge, and/or date of coming into Shaanxi (for imported cases). The data were released and analyzed anonymously.
Based on the recorded information, we can get the daily number of latent, infected and hospitalized individuals, and we call these data sets as traced data, as shown in Figure 1 (A-C).
Note that that daily number of hospitalized cases means the first medical visit and then being quarantined rather than daily number of confirmed cases. Further, we collect the data of population mobility from the website of Baidu Qianxi (http://qianxi.baidu.com). It contains the trend of inflow of population to Shaanxi before the 2020 Spring Festival and after 2019 Spring Festival, as shown in Figure 2 (B).
and be the number of newly imported cases and the number of newly confirmed imported cases on day t in Shaanxi province.
represents the duration from importation to confirmation for imported cases. For k consecutive days j = 1 , … , , is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution with mean (that has to be estimated). Given the daily number of newly confirmed imported cases 1 , … , on m consecutive days 1 , … , and the probability = ( − ≤ < − + 1) that an imported case entered Shaanxi province on day j and was confirmed on day i. We assume that for each j, = ∑ =max { , 1 } is positive. Then parameters 1 , … , can be estimated by 1 , … , and through deconvolution method.
We use the Richardson-Lucy iterative algorithm [5] to solve this problem. The procedure is iterative according to the following formulas:
where ( ) and ( ) are fitted values of and in the n-th iteration respectively. We stop the iteration when the error of fitting
becomes small and the value of 1 ( ) , … , ( ) are reasonable. Because the method above requires that = ∑ =max { , 1 } is positive, which means that at least some fraction of imported cases who entered Shaanxi province on day j would be confirmed during the period 1 , … , , we then can determine the proper 1 and 2 such that > 0 for 1 ≤ ≤ 2 in terms of the distribution of . By using the same method, given the daily number of confirmed local cases and the probability distribution of the duration from infection to confirmation for local cases, we can also estimate the daily number of newly infected local cases on day t during some time period.
To estimate the effective reproduction number ( ), we make an adaptation of the method in [15, 16] to allow for imported cases. With the same notations and assumptions above, for ( ) we have
is the discretized distribution of the serial interval with G(τ) being the cumulative distribution function. Let ℎ be the duration from importation of a primary imported case to infection of the secondary local case, ℎ = H( ) − H(τ − 1) is the discretized distribution of ℎ with H( ) being the cumulative distribution function.
On the basis of the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures we stratify the populations as susceptible ( ), exposed ( ), infected ( ), hospitalized ( ), recovered ( ) compartments, the quarantined susceptible ( ) and quarantined suspected individuals ( ). The flow diagram is shown in Figure 3 . Note that here the model framework extends the model structure in our previous study by including the quarantined suspected compartment [18] [19] [20] , which consists of exposed infectious individuals resulting from contact tracing and individuals with influenza like illness and common fever needing clinical medication. The deterministic model is replaced by a discrete system with stochastic importation since the case numbers are relatively small with most of the early cases being imported in Shaanxi province [10, 12] . This modelling approach can well describe demographic stochasticity. The 
where the random variables in (1) can be defined by binomial Bin(n, p) distributions as follows [10, 12] : 
Let constant m be the transition rate from susceptible class to the suspected compartment via general clinical medication due to fever or illness-like symptoms. The suspected individuals leave this compartment at a rate of , with a proportion, f , if has been confirmed to be infected by the COVID-19, going to the hospitalized compartment, whilst the other proportion, 1-f , has been proven to be not infected by the COVID-19 and goes back to the susceptible class once recovery.
Let the transmission probability be β and the contact rate be c. With contact tracing, we assume a proportion, q, of individuals exposed to the virus is quarantined, and can either move to the compartment B or S q at a rate of βcq or (1 -β)cq), depending on whether they are infected or not, while the other proportion, 1 -q, consists of individuals exposed to the virus who are missed from contact tracing and move to the exposed compartment E at a rate of βc(1 − q)
once infected or stay in compartment S otherwise. All definitions of variables and parameters have been listed in Table 1 .
The imported latent, infected and suspected and hospitalized cases for each day can be Since the implementation of the lock-down strategy in Wuhan on January 23 rd 2020, the prevention strategies in other parts of mainland China have been continuously strengthened. In order to truly describe the constantly strengthening of control strategies, we should consider the contact rate, quarantine rate, diagnosis rate and cure rate as the functions of time t. In this model, we assume that the contact rate c(t) is a decreasing function with respect to time t, given by
where c 0 denotes the baseline contact rate at the initial time (i.e. before January 23 rd , 2020) with c(0) = c 0 , c b denotes the minimum contact rate under the current control strategies with lim t→∞ c(t) = c b , where c b < c 0 , and r 1 denotes the exponential decreasing rate in the contact rate.
Similarly, to characterize the enhanced contact tracing we define ( ) as an increasing function with respect to time t, written as ( ) = � 0 , before Jan 23nd ,2020

We also set the transition rate ( ) as an increasing function with respect to time t, thus the detection period 1/ ( ) is a decreasing function of t with the following form:
, before Jan 23nd ,2020
where δ I0 is the initial rate of confirmation, is the fastest confirmation rate, and 3 is the exponential decreasing rate of the detection period. Definitely, (0) = 0 and lim →∞ ( ) = with > 0 . Let be the time point at which stringent control measures are introduced on Jan 23nd, 2020. Until February 4 th 2020, there was no cured case in Shaanxi province, so the cure rate should be zero before February 4 th 2020. The number of discharged patients has increased rapidly since February 7 th 2020. Therefore, the cure rate is defined as a constant piecewise function based on the real situation.
When simulating the resumption of work, we assume that the movement trend of Shaanxi p � H may reduce 30% , 60% and even 90% corresponding to weaker and weaker epidemic.
From the detailed description about traced data, we can know when and what is the state of each infected person and obtain the number of who are in latent (or quarantined latent), infected and hospitalized classes, as shown in Figure 1 , which shows the evolution process of the epidemic in Shaanxi province. Figure 1 (A) gives both newly reported cases and new cases from traced data, and comparison of two time series indicates that the new cases from traced data is about 7 days ahead of the reported cases data. In particular, Figure 1 (B) and (C) give the epidemic status of cases confirmed before February 7 th and 15 th , respectively. Note that although Shaanxi province began to release the case numbers on January 23 rd , 2020, the first imported latent case came to Shaanxi as early as January 10 th , 2020, and the majority of imported cases were latent and came into Shaanxi before the end of January, 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (A). Figure2(B) shows the correlation between the total imported cases and the number of population flow into the Shaanxi province, from which we calculate the proportion of those inflows that are infected.
We can also illustrate the spatial distribution of imported cases (circles) and local cases (squares) and disease evolution based on the traced data. It follows from Figure 4 that most cases are in
Xi'an city, few cases are in the northern part of Shaanxi while relatively many cases are in the southern part of Shaanxi, which is adjacent to Hubei province. Therefore, we can estimate the impact of population migration on the epidemic situation in the neighboring areas of Hubei Figure 7 (A). It is interesting to note that we can get the part of new infections before February 12 th , 2020 from the recoded traced data in Shaanxi province, shown in Figure 7 (B). It shows that the estimated new infections agree well with the traced data in terms of trend. We note that for some cases, their information is not complete, only the dates of illness onset or first medical visit are recorded, and hence they cannot be considered as new infections at certain dates. That is why the real new infections from traced data are less than the estimated ones, shown in Figure 7 (B).
To estimate the effective reproduction number we let the distribution of serial interval be chosen as gamma distribution with mean of 7.5 days and standard deviation of 3.4 days [4, 11] .
Because the distribution of the duration from importation of a primary imported case to infection of the secondary local case ℎ is unknown, we initially set ℎ be equal to and then estimate the effective reproduction number R(t), as shown in Figure 7 (C). It shows the effective reproduction number started to decline on January 23 rd , 2020 when the prediction and control strategies was strengthened, was less than 1 since around January 27 th , 2020, and stabilized at almost 0 recently, which means few new infections occur. In order to investigate the variation of the effective reproduction number with ℎ varies, sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing the mean of ℎ from 1 to 7 days, as shown in Figure 7 (D). It shows that the more the mean of ℎ , the greater duration of the R(t) being greater than 1 and the earlier the R(t) exceeds the unity.

Since the Spring Festival holiday most people have been at home, when do they return back to work/study is a challenging problem. Consequently, we investigate the effect of population movement on infections, especially on the possibility of inducing the second outbreak. To this end, we initially estimate the unknown parameters by least square methods, listed in Table 1 , by fitting the discrete stochastic model to the traced data between January 10 th to February 7 th (purple curve with dots), and by using the mean parameter values of 1000 times of least square estimations (listed in Table 1 ) we get 500 stochastic trajectories of model (1), as shown in Figure 8 (A-C). To investigate the effect of resumption of work on the epidemic, especially on possible second outbreak, by which we may suggest the public health sectors when workers can return back to Shaanxi, we predicate the disease infection by using the data on imported cases and moving from other cities to Shaanxi province (shown in Figure 2 ). Suppose population to start to return back to Shannxi province from February 24 th to March 9 th , 2020, we can see from Figure 9 the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Shaanxi province is located northwest of China, adjacent to Hubei in the south. Therefore, except for Xi'an city, the capital of Shaanxi, many confirmed cases are in the southern part of Shaanxi province. It is interesting to note that Health Commission of Shaanxi Province released the case number every day with very detailed information, by which we can know when and who infected whom. Then except for the new reported (or cumulative) number of confirmed cases, we can get the daily number of individuals who are in latent (or quarantined latent), infected and hospitalized compartments, which gives the evolution process of the epidemic in Shaanxi province. We can get the durations from illness onset to the first medical visit, to the hospitalization, and to confirmation of the case. These durations are relatively smaller than those for mainland China or Hubei province [3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17] , which implies that the control measures implemented in Shaanxi are timely and medical resources are relatively sufficient.
From the detailed data description, we can obtain the transmission chains over the time, which enable to calculate the control reproduction number under the implementation of stringent control strategies. The mean control reproduction number ranges from 1.48 to 1.69, and the distribution of these chains agrees well with the effective reproduction number. Note that the effective number has been declining, and is less than unity since January 27 th 2020. Recently it has stabilized at almost zero, meaning that no new infections occur, which seem to be in line with real data, as shown in Figures 1 and 7 [7] .
In this study we extend our deterministic model framework [9, [18] [19] [20] ] to a discrete system incorporating stochastic modeling of imported cases to represent the relatively small number of cases observed in the Shaanxi province, with about half of them being imported cases. It is worth noting that traced data is around 7 days ahead of the reported ones, as illustrated in Figure 1 (A).
Moreover, detailed data records revealed that the time interval between the first visit to a doctor and confirmation was longer, with a median of around 4 days. Then, the number of reported cases is not suitable to identify the model or estimate the parameters due to delays such as report delay, confirmation delay, etc. Therefore, it is not accurate to associate the number of confirmed cases with the number of cases in hospital, which may seriously overestimate the scale of the epidemic. Therefore, the multiple traced data sets have been employed to identify the proposed discrete stochastic model and estimate the unknown parameters in this work. Consequently, we use the number of individuals in E, I, and H classes form traced data rather than the newly (or cumulative) reported number to parameterize the model.
We investigate the impact of population movement (resumption of work) on the potential second outbreak by using movement data from other cities to Shaanxi province. Our main results indicate that the proportion of imported cases is a key variable in order to determine All rights reserved.

The greater the proportion of imported cases the larger the second outbreak has. Furthermore, intermittent importation may induce one further outbreak episode but with small peak values.
From our study, we can conclude that it is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using data from contact tracing rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main source of infection. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside Hubei Province, but also provide important and accurate data supporting the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas.
In the present investigation, we devised a stochastic model that can be used as an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province or other similar provinces. From the data analysis, it seems that the stringent public health interventions adopted by the Chinese authorities are effective in controlling the infection. According to data from contact tracing, the first imported cases in the Shaanxi Province occurred earlier than January 10 th 2020, and most of the imported cases were imported to the Shaanxi Province before the implementation of the national travel restrictions on January 23 rd 2020. Therefore, the earlier the implementation of the travel restrictions, the greater the reduction of infected cases by COVID-19 in the Shaanxi province has. An intermittent population inflow with low proportion of imported cases may significantly mitigate the transmission risk. Thus, if the public health authorities can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it would be possible for the Shaanxi province to return back and resume working continuously.
It is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using traced data rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main and the epidemic situation is not serious. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside Hubei
Province, but also provide important and accurate data support for the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas.
We proposed a stochastic model which can provide an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province (and can eventually be adapted for other similar provinces of China). Data analysis reveals that strengthening the public health interventions, tracing imported cases and improving the confirmation rate are effective and timely after January 23 rd 2020. According to the traced data shown in Figure 1 , the first imported cases in Shaanxi Province were earlier than January 10, and most of the imported cases were imported to Shaanxi Province before the national travel restrictions were implemented on January 23nd, as shown in Figure 2 . Therefore, the earlier implementation of travel restriction will greatly reduce the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province, which was not serious.
The findings suggest that keeping an intermittent population inflow with a low proportion of imported cases may induce a small second outbreak and hence decrease the transmission risk.
Thus, if we can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it is possible for Shaanxi to resume work continuously, especially intermittently. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

164b0678afc42f1923aa100b624ca969a53fb3b2,"Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28, 2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.","Recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus (designated 2019-nCoV) originated in Wuhan, China raised serious public health concerns and many human tragedies. To manage the epidemics resulting from virus spreading across China and other countries forecasting the occurrence of future cases is extremely important. Such forecasting is very complicated and uncertain since many factors are poorly understood or estimated with a large possible error. Two major factors include spatial movement of virus carriers (i.e., infected individuals) and the basic reproduction number R0 (average number of new infections originated from an infected individual).
As a result of great public attention to the virus spreading several approaches were recently reported attempting to model the epidemics and infection dynamics (Chen et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

These models are certainly useful to understand the implications of various quarantine procedures, public health actions, and possible virus modifications. However, the reported models are, by its nature, very complicated with numerous assumptions and requiring many parameters values of which are not known with good accuracy. As a result, some predictions (Nishiura et al., 2020) were more educated guesses although eventually they were confirmed qualitatively.
In this work, we present the results of fitting a very simple (perhaps even simplistic) model to the available data and a forecast of new infections.
The logistic model has been used in population dynamics and specifically in epidemics for a long time (Bailey, 1950; Bangert, Molyneux, Lindsay, Fitzpatrick, & Engels, 2017; Cockburn, 1960; Jowett, Browning, & Haning, 1974; Koopman, 2004; Mansfield & Hensley, 1960; Waggoner & Aylor, 2000) . Mathematically, the model describes dynamic evolution of a population P (in our case the number of infected individuals) being controlled by the growth rate r and population capacity K due to limiting resources. In continuous time t the change of P is
Initially, the growth of P is close to exponential since the term (1 − ⁄ ) is almost one. When P becomes larger (commensurate with K) the growth rate slows down with = (1 − ) (2) becoming an effective instantaneous growth rate.
In discrete time, more appropriate to daily reported infection cases, the logistic model becomes
where P(t) and P(t+1) are populations on consecutive days, R0 * is the growth rate (basic reproduction number in epidemiology) at the beginning of the logistic growth, and K is the limiting population. When plotted as a function of time t, both Eqs. (1) and (3) result in a classic sigmoidal curve with
being the effective reproduction rate at time t.
The logistic model may be adequate for the analysis of mainland China since the country can be treated as a unit where a vast majority of cases occurred without any significant ""import"" or ""export"" of cases.

We analyzed infection cases in mainland China as reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/xxgzbd/gzbd_index.shtml). As of the time of writing the number of cases is shown in Table 1 . The data are also plotted in Figure 1 . The first column in Table 1 represents days from the beginning of the outbreak. There is a considerable controversy as to the exact date of the outbreak with most reports pointing to mid-December (Li et al., 2020; Wang, Horby, Hayden, & Gao, 2020) while one analysis suggest multiple sources of original infection (Nishiura et al., 2020) . Initially, the outbreak was not recognized and number of confirmed cases is not fully known (P. Wu et al., 2020) . Initially, (Figure 1 ), the number of cases increased exponentially. This feature was also clearly recognized in a previous report (Zhao et al., 2020b) . (1), (2), (3) -ends of Periods 1, 2, and 3. Data beyond Feb. 6 were not used in model fitting and predictions .

This decline of the growth rate is clearly demonstrated by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number Re (fourth column in Table 1 ) calculated simply as a ratio of cases on consecutive days
Eq. (5) also shows a linearization of the discrete logistic model (Eq. (3)) that was used to estimate the Re(t=30) = R0 * and capacity K. An example of such linearization for Period 1 is shown in Figure 2 with the initial 16 points (blue points and line in Figure 2) . The same figure also shows linearization using for Period 2 (orange points and line in Figure 2 ). For all periods the effective reproduction numbers decrease in time. As new data were reported daily, we followed with subsequent analysis in near-real time with three periods as shown in Table 2 In contrast, a simple linearization of Re in time (Figure 3) back-estimated the original basic reproduction number R0 at about 2.4 to 2.5, agreeing well with other values recently reported Liu et al., 2020; Majumder & Mandl, 2020; Zhang & Wang, 2020a , 2020b Zhao et al., 2020a) . The discrepancy between these two estimates can be attributed a potential loss of virulence of the virus but most likely due to extreme measures to contain virus spread in China. .

We use linear regression as shown in Figure 3 to calculate the effective reproduction numbers for a series of days Re * (t) with the * superscript denoting that the values are calculated from the regression. Using Eqs. (3) and (4) the predicted values of P(t) can be calculated regressively as
Based on the linearization of Eq. (5), we obtained the parameters of the logistic model for three periods as shown in Table 2 The model predicted further increases of the infected cases but slower than the initial exponential growth. As expected, new data resulted in further model refinement primarily in the values of K and the resulting maximum cases.

One significant factor that could invalidate the predictions is a possibility of secondary or parallel outbreaks perhaps with different etiology as previously suggested for the original Wuhan outbreak (P.

179df1e769292dd113cef1b54b0b43213e6b5c97,"COVID-19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID-19 severity.
This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5 th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID-19 infection or ICU admission.
Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID-19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04).
Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 -7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28-10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICUadmitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2. 44 -16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 -48.2).

Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 -7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 -5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity.
Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID-19.","The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), involving a novel type of coronavirus originally identified in Wuhan, China. At the time of writing, there have been 105,586 confirmed cases around the world with 3,584 deaths (1) .
Defining the spectrum of clinical manifestations and the risk factors for severe COVID-19 infections has been identified as an urgent research priority (2, 3) .
As the virus spreads globally it is likely that government strategies will shift from containment and delay towards mitigation (4) . This will involve rapidly scaling up healthcare resources including staff, equipment, facilities, and training, to effectively identify and treat patients. To maximise the use of these limited resources it will be imperative that clinicians are able to triage COVID-19 patients likely to recover after a mild illness from those who are not. In order to do this, a better understanding of the symptoms and comorbidities (which are the first and most routinely collected components of patient data) related to COVID-19 severity is required. This can improve patient outcomes through three chief mechanisms: early clinical intervention in high-risk patients, designing appropriate clinical pathways and risk prediction tools, and the efficient allocation of scarce resources and expensive treatments. Further still, the early identification of individuals more likely to deteriorate can help direct appropriate public health actions to protect the vulnerable and prevent further spread of infection.
A recent meta-analysis of symptoms in 50,466 COVID-19 patients from 10 studies found that fever and cough were the most common symptoms, with 89.1% and 72.2% experiencing these, respectively (5) . It also found that the case fatality rate (CFR) was 4.3%, but the association between individual patient factors and severe infection was not investigated. Most reported cases have occurred in adults (median age 59 years) (6) . According to most recent US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, risk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk. (7) The primary aim of this study is therefore to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis, aggregating all currently available data from published studies, of symptoms and comorbidities predictive for severe illness with COVID-19.
This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. Identification of relevant or 'characteristic*' or 'co-morbidit*' or 'comorbidit*' or 'condition*'. Two reviewers (VG, JMY) independently screened the list of titles and abstracts, and the full text of chosen manuscripts. Disagreements on which manuscripts to include during both title and abstract screen, and the subsequent full-text analysis, were discussed until a conclusion was reached. In addition to the MEDLINE/EMBASE/Global Health search, citation tracking was used to identify any remaining relevant published studies, though none were identified.
Unpublished studies were not retrieved due to uncertain data quality.
All studies evaluating individual symptoms and comorbidities in predicting severe infection (as measured by disease severity criteria, or ICU admission) were included. All studies of any design, from any time since the outbreak started (in December 2019) were eligible, except case reports of individual patients or literature reviews. To avoid selection bias, no subjective quality criteria were applied to the studies for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included: [1] studies of exclusively paediatric or pregnant patients, due to the varying presentation of COVID-19 in these groups, [2] insufficient data on symptoms/comorbidities on admission in either severe or non-severe disease groups (or ICU and non-ICU 6 groups), [3] coronavirus strains other than COVID-19 and [4] studies not written in English, because of practical limitations with translation.
Two reviewers independently extracted data from the included studies for both narrative synthesis and statistical analysis. From each study, various details including the study population, investigated predictive symptoms or comorbidities, and the definitions used to measure outcomes, were extracted into Microsoft excel. These details are presented by study in Table 1 . The number of patients in each study, both with and without each symptom or comorbidity, was extracted for statistical analysis (described below).
The symptoms or comorbidities presented were investigated in at least three included studies. Where studies measured symptoms ambiguously (including abdominal pain/diarrhea (8) , myalgia/fatigue (9) , and nausea/vomiting (10)), this data was excluded. Some studies reported heart disease and stroke separately (10) (11) (12) . To allow comparability between studies for meta-analysis, these were grouped into a single predictor (cardiovascular disease). One study was excluded from the analysis of dyspnoea as a predictor of severity, as dyspnoea was part of the definition for severity used by the authors (13) .
For disease severity, the included studies varied in their differentiation of patients' disease status, with classifications of 'mild, moderate, severe and critical' (14) , 'ordinary and severe/critical' (8), 'common and severe' (13) , and 'non-severe and severe', disease (10, 12) . The first outcome measure used was severe (including both severe and critical cases) vs. non-severe disease. For ICU admission, the included studies varied in their definition of ICU admission, with classifications of 'ICU, mechanical ventilation or death and non-ICU' (10) , and 'ICU and non-ICU' (9, 11) . The second outcome measure used was ICU admission All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Patient numbers were aggregated across all included studies for each group included in the meta-analysis. Gender was compared between groups using the Chi2 test in STATA (15). This was not possible for age due to a lack of individuallevel data. The predictive value of symptoms and comorbidities for each of severe disease and ICU admission was estimated with random effects meta-analysis in STATA. Random effects models were used to account for between study heterogeneity (16) , which was estimated with Tau-squared. This provided a pooled odds ratio (pOR), 95% confidence intervals, and a p-value, for each symptom or comorbidity. A p-value of <0.05 was used as a marker for evidence of significant association. Detailed forest plots of the predictive symptoms and comorbidities common to both disease severity and ICU admission are illustrated in the supplementary information file
The PRISMA flow diagram ( Figure 1 ) illustrates the process for selection of papers in this study.
The initial search on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health produced 2259 results. After removing duplicates and applying exclusion criteria, there were 42 papers meeting our criteria from title and abstract analysis. On further review, the majority of these studies did not compare proportions of patients with symptoms or comorbidities between severe (or ICU admitted) and non-severe disease (or non-ICU admitted) groups. The reasons for all study exclusions are outlined in Figure 1 . A total of seven studies were selected for inclusion. All rights reserved.

These 7 studies reported on a total of 1813 patients. All included studies were retrospective cohort studies in design, conducted between December 2019 and February 2020 in China, during the novel coronavirus (SARS-2-CoV) outbreak. Guan et al (10) conducted the largest study with 1099 COVID-19 patients, whilst Huang et al (9) included 40 patients in their study. The number of symptoms investigated varied from 5 in one study (13) to 14 in others (10, 11) . The range of comorbidities investigated varied greatly with two studies not including any (13, 14) and one including 22 comorbidities (12) . 
All 7 included studies were retrospective cohort studies, and were critically appraised using the STROBE checklist (17) . The 22 items on the STROBE checklist were formulated into 47 individual indicators, against which each study was marked. Figure 2 illustrates the proportion of included studies which met each individual appraisal indicator. Each paper was assigned an overall quality score based on the percentage of STROBE checklist criteria met (<55% = -, 55-65% = +, >65% = ++), as outlined in Table 1 .
Appraising with the STROBE checklist highlighted several major weaknesses in the included studies. Firstly, there was no consistent definition on what constituted severe disease. The WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 (18) defined a severe case as tachypnoea (≥30 breaths/min) or oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest, or PaO2/FiO2<300mmHg. Critical cases were defined as All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Although the above criteria were used in some included studies, many defined only one out of severe and critical, with one (8) using a definition for a single severe/critical cohort. One study reported both severity and critical cases (10), using criteria set by the American Thoracic Society to judge severity. Secondly, the time at which severity of disease was determined was not always clear. Severity was assessed on admission in two studies (10, 12) , whilst three studies did not specify when severity was assessed (8, 13, 14) . It is possible, therefore, that the non-severe group included patients who went on to later develop severe disease. Thirdly, the time point at which symptoms were measured varied from illness onset (via recall) (9, (11) (12) (13) to clinical presentation (10, 14) . In the study by Li et al, it was not clear when symptoms were measured (8) . Finally, no study specified how each individual symptom or comorbidity was measured. For instance, it was unclear whether fever was objectively measured, and if so, how or by whom. Studies may therefore have been susceptible to measurement and reporting bias.

A total of seven symptoms were included in the model for severe disease and six for ICU admission, as well as four comorbidities in both. The most prevalent symptoms in the severe group were cough (70.5%), fever (64.1%) and fatigue (44.5%); in the ICU group these were cough (67.2%), fever (62.9%) and dyspnoea (61.2%). The most prevalent comorbidities in the severe group were hypertension (25.4%) and diabetes (16.8%) and in the ICU group were hypertension (40.5%) and CVD (24.1%).
Although no more likely to be in the severe group, men were 1.55 times more likely than women to be admitted to ICU (95% CI 1.02 -2.36). Dyspnoea was the only symptom significantly associated with both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 -7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28-10.0), being more strongly associated with the latter. Cough was associated with severe disease (pOR 1.63, 95% respectively. In contrast, diabetes was not significantly associated with ICU admission, although the Tau-squared value here was unusually high implying a high level of heterogeneity between studies in this particular case.

The prevalence of dyspnoea in the ICU group, however, was 67.2%, compared with 10.2% in the non-ICU group. Whilst dyspnoea is not a particularly common symptom in COVID-19 patients, its significant association with both severe disease and ICU admission may help discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID-19
cases, when present.
The findings reported here are in keeping with current knowledge that the elderly and those with comorbidities are more susceptible to severe infection. those with: cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) and hypertension (6.0%) (19) . Unlike the China CDC study (19) that presented case fatality rates for different groups, our findings compare those with particular comorbidities to those without, allowing us to estimate the effect of a particular comorbidity on COVID-19 severity. Although we did not investigate death (and included COPD rather than chronic respiratory disease), our analysis similarly suggests that comorbidities are not uniform in terms of the risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Despite being uncommon in our study population, COPD was by far the strongest risk factor for COVID-19 severity, followed by CVD and hypertension.
The foremost limitation of this study was an inability to carry out a multivariable analysis to account for the presence of several symptoms, comorbidities and All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 15.20035360 doi: medRxiv preprint potential confounders. Although this outbreak has seen the evolution of linked data and large datasets (19) which would be suitable for multivariable analysis, these currently lack the quality of published data: there are large amounts of missing data, a narrow range of collected variables, and uncertainty about data collection methods and consistency. Our univariable analysis is therefore valuable in evaluating specific individual symptoms and comorbidities predictive for COVID-19 severity using high-quality evidence in the form of peer-reviewed studies.
Secondly, the studies included here were all from China, so the generalisability of findings to other countries and populations is not clear. The Chinese may differ to other populations in terms of their health-seeking behaviour, symptom reporting, prevalence of different comorbidities, as well as their access to high quality health services. Nonetheless, given the current dearth of contextually specific evidence available, our findings will help to inform future research and actions in other countries as the outbreak develops. Finally, it was not possible to account for the timing of presentation in the statistical analysis. If a patient presented after many days of being symptomatic, this may have affected disease severity, compared with an earlier clinical presentation. However, this limitation does not apply to comorbidities, and Table   2 shows information from individual studies on median duration of symptoms before admission, which appears similar between severe (or ICU) and nonsevere (or non-ICU) cases. It is therefore unlikely that this will have biased the overall results.
By identifying the symptoms and comorbidities predictive for more severe disease, clinicians can better stratify the risk of individual patients, as early as their initial contact with health services. This can lead to practical changes in management, which can improve allocative efficiency as well as clinical outcomes, through the consideration of more intensive environments of care All rights reserved.

These can also be formalised within risk stratification tools to aid clinical decision-making, such as the CURB65 tool for community-acquired pneumonia (20) . As the number of hospitalised COVID-19 cases continues to increase, hospitals will increasingly need to ration limited resources and improve clinical pathways to effectively prioritise patients with greatest clinical need. This is important, as COVID-19 is already placing increased pressure on ICUs, and anticipation of future demand, based on local population characteristics, may enable more timely planning and resource mobilisation (21) . Identifying those at the highest risk will also facilitate better-informed discussions between clinicians, patients and patients' families about the anticipated clinical trajectory, allowing more accurate and timely advance care discussions to occur.
Identifying those at high-risk will aid the public health response in controlling the spread of disease. Given the ubiquity of comorbidities in the elderly population, and their increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection (18), knowledge on the differing prevalence and risk of various conditions may help to focus and tailor public health efforts such as the screening of asymptomatic individuals, risk communication, contact tracing, self-isolation and social distancing. For instance, for COPD, which is less common in the general population and very strongly associated with ICU admission, a more targeted and intensive health protection strategy may be warranted, compared to other conditions (such as hypertension) that are more difficult to target due to their higher prevalence in the general population.
Furthermore, if it is found that severity of illness is related to infectivity, as is the case in the closely related SARS-CoV, then identifying patients who may develop severe illness can help guide precautions to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV2.
These include infection control decisions regarding the limited availability of isolation rooms and personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly in more resource-constrained settings. This will be of particular importance as the outbreak develops, if the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 patients increases.

Measurement tools used in studies should aim to objectively measure symptoms where possible, and details on how and when symptoms were ascertained should be made clear in all studies. There was also heterogeneity in the range of symptoms and comorbidities recorded by different studies, and some studies grouped various symptoms (8) (9) (10) , limiting the utility of such data.
Studies investigating COVID-19 severity should avoid using subjective or selfreported criteria (such as dyspnoea) in the definition of severity, as in one study included here (13) . To ensure consistency between studies and comparability, the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 definition of severe and critical cases should be used. Furthermore, the distinction between cases that are severe and critical should be clearly made in studies, to enable more accurate risk stratification of the most unwell patients.
For future research on predictors of severity, research should aim to include greater detail on specific conditions, including how well controlled chronic conditions were before and during admission. If the severity of COVID-19 varies according to the severity of underlying comorbidities, there may be a case for optimising routine treatment for healthy, uninfected individuals, as a potential public health action to mitigate risk. Multivariable analysis to identify which groups of symptoms or comorbidities are most associated with severe or critical disease will also be valuable.
The existing literature on COVID-19 fails to elucidate the specific symptoms and comorbidities most predictive for severe COVID-19 cases. Our analysis finds that dyspnoea is the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be a useful symptom to help guide clinical management decisions early in the course of illness.

Whilst COPD, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension were all associated with severity, COPD was the most strongly predictive. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, the difference in effect sizes for COPD and the other included comorbidities was large, suggesting COPD patients are particularly vulnerable to critically severe disease. As the outbreak develops, future research must aim to substantiate these findings by investigating factors related to disease severity. This will aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, and resource allocation, and allow public health interventions to be targeted at the most vulnerable.

180c88b68816bbb6eb57aa515a3aec4020178729,"20 E-probe Diagnostic for Nucleic acid Analysis (EDNA) is a bioinformatic tool originally 21 developed to detect plant pathogens in metagenomic databases. However, 22 enhancements made to EDNA increased its capacity to conduct hypothesis directed 23 detection of specific gene targets present in transcriptomic databases. To target specific 24 pathogenicity factors used by the pathogen to infect its host or other targets of interest, 25 e-probes need to be developed for transcripts related to that function. In this study, 26 EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes 27 related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level. E-probes were designed from 28 genes up-regulated during A. flavus aflatoxin production. EDNAtran detected gene 29 transcripts related to aflatoxin production in a transcriptomic database from corn, where 30 aflatoxin was produced. The results were significantly different from e-probes being 31 used in the transcriptomic database where aflatoxin was not produced (atoxigenic AF36 32 strain and toxigenic AF70 in Potato Dextrose Broth). 33 34 Maize [1], peanuts [2], tree nuts, dried spices [3] and cottonseed [4] are crops that can 35 be infected during the pre-harvest, post-harvest and/or storage period with Aspergillus 36 flavus Link. This fungus produces polyketide secondary metabolites named aflatoxins. 37","developed (72 hours), according to ATCC instructions. AF70 was thawed for 5 minutes, 113 directly plated onto Malt extract agar, and incubated at 25 °C in darkness until mycelium 114 was developed (72 hours), according to ATCC instructions. Agar plugs with actively 115 growing mycelia were re-plated in MEAbl agar and incubated at their optimal 116 temperatures in the dark until extensive conidial development (5 days) was observed. 117
The cultures (AF36 and AF70) containing extensive conidia growth were used to 118 inoculate ground corn and Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB). 119
Corn substrate was prepared using dried corn kernels (Zea mays). Kernels were weight 120 (20g) and ground (using a coffee grinder Mr. Coffee Precision Coffee Grinder IDS77) 121 until obtaining pieces with the approximate texture of coarse sand (0.5-1mm in 122 diameter). The coarse grains were autoclaved (dry cycle) for 20 minutes in 123 polycarbonate containers (Magenta GA-7, Plantmedia, US) and its humidity was 124 adjusted to keep between 25 -33% w/v (Modified from Woloshuk, Cavaletto, and 125
Cleveland 1997). 126
Ground corn kernels and PDB media were inoculated with conidial suspensions 127 obtained by washing A. flavus MEAbl plates with 2 mL of sterile distilled water. Conidia 128 collected (2 mL) were then added to a single vial containing 4mL of distilled water for a 129 final dilution of 3:1 v/v (Spore suspension was not quantified). Six mL of spore 130 suspension was used to inoculate each replicate (20 g of ground corn and PDB). The 131 ground grain was inoculated with the A. flavus suspension in polycarbonate containers 132 and homogeneously mixed by rolling the containers to allow uniform distribution of the 133 conidia. Similarly, 250 mL flasks containing 44mL of PDB were inoculated with 6 mL of 134 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The control was AF70 in PDB (non-conducive for 160 aflatoxin production), and the treatment was AF70 in corn (conducive for aflatoxin 161 production) [37] . Positive fold change (up-regulated) genes were selected using the 162 log2 fold change metric obtained from the DeSeq2 analysis. Upregulated gene 163 sequences having log2 fold changes greater than five were retrieved by an in-house 164

The genomes from A. flavus AF70 (Accession: JZDT00000000.1) and NRRL3357 167 (Accession: AAIH00000000.2 ) [38] were obtained from Genbank. Sequences for the 168 aflatoxin gene cluster of AF70 (AY510453) and AF36 (AY510455) were also retrieved 169 from GenBank [39] . E-probes 80 nt long were generated using the e-probe pipeline for The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The sequenced reads then 202 were mapped to the A. flavus AF70 strain genome to retrieve information about 203 potential up-regulation and down-regulation of genes by using STAR [36] and DESeq2. 204
In total, 44 genes were identified as up-regulated and 129 genes were down-regulated 205 in the A. flavus genome (Error! Reference source not found. Table) . Identified as part of 206 the aflatoxin gene cluster, only 17 out of 44 upregulated genes. From two to six gene 207 fold changes were plotted in a hierarchical clustering heat map as well as in a MAPlot 208 (Fig 1 Fig 2) . 209 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

AF36 genome-wide e-probes were not generated 224 because there is not a genome sequence available yet for that specific strain. 225
As expected, 231 e-probes had hits creating High-Quality Matches (HQMs) in AF70-227 corn transcriptome datasets; meanwhile, AF70-PDB had only 39 HQMs (Fig 3) . AF36-228 corn had only two HQMs and AF36-PDB had 12 HQMs (Table 1) . EDNAtran 229 discriminated between the transcriptomic databases with abundant aflatoxin production 230 and the transcriptomes from low-toxin production based on EDNA eukaryotic metrics 231
[32] ( Table 1) . However, to infer the presence of aflatoxin we can only use frequencies 232 of hits as an indirect measure. In this case, the number of times a read was mapped to 233 an e-probe was recorded and counted without any limits. A dot plot of alignment length 234 vs. percent identity with marginal hit frequencies facilitates visualizing hit frequencies. 235
Specifically for A. flavus AF70 in corn, it was observable that the hit frequencies were 236 very high -around 9,000 hits per e-probe -when the alignments are above 90% 237 identity and the alignment length was approaching to the total length of the e-probe ( Fig Fig 3. EDNA transcriptomics hits distribution and frequencies for A. growing on PDB, and AF36 on corn and PDB (Fig. 5 and Table 2 ). In conclusion, 266
EDNAtran was able to find statistically significant differences between the transcriptomic 267 data set of the highly toxigenic sample, from the non-toxigenic samples, using 231 e-268 probes generated in this study. 269 Inspectors at international ports require a rapid detection method when decisions need 285 to be done on site. EDNA has been considered a good candidate to be used as a 286 diagnostic tool in ports of entry, due to its multiplexing capacity and rapidness. Yet, 287 EDNA does not include an analysis of pathogen viability. If DNA-based detection 288 (metagenomic analysis) is positive and viability needs to be addressed, the use of 289 additional tests is not a viable approach for perishable or time-sensitive shipments. 290
Using RNA sequencing and relative quantification of active genes is ideal to infer the 291 viability of plant pathogens. The use of EDNA transcriptomics to infer the production of 292 aflatoxin is a first attempt to introduce a novel strategy by using new sequencing 293 technologies to identify viable plant pathogens. The use of e-probes that are designed 294 on up-regulated genes incorporates an advantage to EDNA transcriptomics over other 295 tools that use RNA sequencing to assess gene expression [37] . The advantage of 296 EDNA transcriptomics over other methods of transcript frequency inference and 297 calculation is that the time-consuming map against the reference genome is not 298 necessary. Instead, we align the sample reads to the highly specific e-probes, which are 299 designed for known up-regulated genes. Directing the analysis to genes that are known 300 to be up-regulated reduces the analysis time tremendously since a mapping against a 301 whole genome is no longer necessary. Where needed total nucleic acids (DNA and 302 RNA) can be extracted from the sample of interest to perform both pathogen detection 303 and gene activity. 304 .

181b7b57851e6f58a601b68e613d10c10616f774,"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. : bioRxiv preprint B cell responses in recovered patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: A six-year follow-up study.","The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) (C. Wang, Horby, Hayden, & Gao, 2020) and its alarmingly quick transmission to 25 other countries across the world (Centers-of-Disease-Control-and-Prevention, 2020) resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a global health emergency on 30 January 2020 (World-Health-Organization, 2020b) . This came just one month after the first reported case on 31 December 2019 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). WHO, in its first emergency meeting (World-Health-Organization, 2020a), estimated the fatality rate of COVID-19 to be around 4%.
Worldwide collaborative efforts from scientists are underway to understand the novel and rapidly spreading virus that causes this disease, SARS-CoV-2 (originally tentatively named 2019-nCoV), and to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing it (Heymann, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Xin Liu & Wang, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .
Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae.
These viruses mostly infect animals, including birds and mammals. In humans, they generally cause mild respiratory infections, such as those observed in the common cold. However, some recent human Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recent SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus (Lu et al., 2020) . It has a genome size of ~30 kilobases which, like other coronaviruses, encodes for multiple structural and non-structural proteins. The structural proteins include the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. With SARS-CoV-2 being discovered very recently, there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus (e.g., information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or T cell responses). Preliminary studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is quite similar to SARS-CoV based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) , and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko & Munster, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses, previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2.
Various reports related to SARS-CoV suggest a protective role of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. For the former case, antibody responses generated against the S protein, the most exposed protein of SARS-CoV, have been shown to protect from infection in mouse models (Deming et al., 2006; Graham et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2004) . In addition, multiple studies have shown that antibodies generated against the N protein of SARS-CoV, a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection (Lin et al., 2003) , were particularly prevalent in SARS-CoV-infected patients (X Liu et al., 2004; J. Wang et al., 2003) . While being effective, the antibody response was found to be short-lived in convalescent SARS-CoV patients (Tang et al., 2011) . In contrast, T cell responses have been shown to provide long-term protection (Fan et al., 2009; Peng et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2011) , even up to 11 years post-infection (Ng et al., 2016) , and thus has attracted more interest for a prospective vaccine against SARS-CoV [reviewed in (W. J. Liu et al., 2017) ]. Among all SARS-
CoV proteins, T cell responses against the structural proteins have been found to be the most immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of convalescent SARS-CoV patients as compared to the non-structural proteins (C. K.-F. Li et al., 2008) . Further, of the structural proteins, T cell responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting (Channappanavar, Fett, Zhao, Meyerholz, & Perlman, 2014) .
Here, by analysing available experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes (both linear and discontinuous) and T cell epitopes, we identify and report those that are completely identical and comprise no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020). These epitopes have the potential, therefore, to elicit a cross-reactive/effective response against SARS-CoV-2. We focused particularly on the epitopes in the S and N structural proteins due to their dominant and longlasting immune response previously reported against SARS-CoV. For the identified T cell epitopes, we additionally incorporated the information about the associated MHC alleles to provide a list of epitopes that seek to maximize population coverage globally, as well as in China. Our presented results can potentially narrow down the search for potent targets for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and help guide experimental studies focused on vaccine development.

A total of 80 whole genome sequences of SARS- The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.933226 doi: bioRxiv preprint http://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319/11) and two sequences (EPI_ISL_406959 and EPI_ISL_406960) that were partial genomes. These nucleotide sequences were aligned to the GenBank reference sequence (accession ID: NC_045512.2) and then translated into amino acid residues according to the coding sequence positions provided along the reference sequence for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (orf1a, orf1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, and ORF10). These sequences were aligned separately for each protein using the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program (Katoh & Standley, 2013) . Reference protein sequences for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were obtained following the same procedure from GenBank using the accession IDs NC_004718.3 and NC_019843.3, respectively. (Pickett et al., 2012) by querying for the virus species name: ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus"" from human hosts. We limited our search to include only the experimentally-determined epitopes that were associated with at least one positive assay: (i) positive B cell assays (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)based qualitative binding) for B cell epitopes; and (ii) either positive T cell assays (such as enzymelinked immune absorbent spot (ELISPOT) or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) IFN-γ release), or positive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding assays for T cell epitopes. Strictly speaking, the latter set of epitopes, determined using positive MHC binding assays, are candidate epitopes, since a T cell response has not been confirmed experimentally. However, for brevity and to be consistent with the terminology used in the ViPR database, we will not make this qualification, and will simply refer to them as epitopes in this study. The number of B cell and T cell epitopes obtained from the database following the above procedure is listed in Table 1 .
Population coverages for sets of T cell epitopes were computed using the tool provided by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (http://tools.iedb.org/population/; accessed 9 February 2020) (Vita et al., 2019). This tool uses the distribution of MHC alleles (with at least 4-digit resolution, e.g., A*02:01) within a defined population (obtained from http://www.allelefrequencies.net/) to estimate the population coverage for a set of T cell epitopes. The estimated population coverage represents the percentage of individuals within the population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one T cell epitope from the set. To identify the set of epitopes associated with MHC alleles that would maximize the population coverage, we adopted a greedy approach: (i) we first identified the MHC allele with the highest individual population coverage and initialized the set with their associated epitopes, then (ii) we progressively added epitopes associated with other MHC alleles that resulted in the largest increase of the accumulated population coverage. We stopped when no increase in the accumulated population coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated with any of the remaining MHC alleles.

We used the publicly available software PASTA v1.6.4 [28] to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of each structural protein using the unique set of sequences in the available data of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We additionally included the Zaria Bat coronavirus strain (accession ID: HQ166910.1) to serve as an outgroup. The appropriate parameters for tree estimation are automatically selected in the software based on the provided sequence data. For visualizing the constructed phylogenetic trees, we used the publicly available software Dendroscope v3.6.3 [29] . Each constructed tree was rooted with the outgroup Zaria Bat coronavirus strain, and circular phylogram layout was used.
SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be close to SARS-CoV-much more so than MERS-CoV-based on full-length genome phylogenetic analysis (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . We checked whether this is also true at the level of the individual structural proteins (S, E, M, and N). A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) (Figure 1a ). The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins ( Figure 1a ); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b) . We note that while the former analysis (Figure 1a) was based on the reference sequence of each coronavirus, it is indeed a good representative of the virus population, since few amino acid mutations have been observed in the corresponding sequence data ( Figure S1 ). It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004.
Given the close genetic similarity between the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we attempted to leverage immunological studies of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV to potentially aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2. We focused specifically on the S and N proteins as these are known to induce potent and long-lived immune responses in SARS-CoV (Channappanavar et al., 2014; Deming et al., 2006; Graham et al., 2012; W. J. Liu et al., 2017; X Liu et al., 2004; J. Wang et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2004) . We used the available SARS-CoV-derived experimentally-determined epitope data (see Materials and Methods) and searched to identify T cell and B cell epitopes that were identicaland hence potentially cross-reactive-across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We first report the analysis for T cell epitopes, which have been shown to provide a long-lasting immune response against SARS-CoV (Channappanavar et al., 2014) , followed by a discussion of B cell epitopes.

The SARS-CoV-derived T cell epitopes used in this study were experimentally-determined from two different types of assays (Pickett et al., 2012) : (i) positive T cell assays, which tested for a T cell response against epitopes, and (ii) positive MHC binding assays, which tested for epitope-MHC binding. We aligned these T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. Among the 115 T cell epitopes that were determined by positive T cell assays (Table 1) , we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within SARS-CoV-2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020) ( Table 2) . Interestingly, all of these were present in either the N (16) or S (11) protein. MHC binding assays were performed for 19 of these 27 epitopes, and these were reported to be associated with only MHC binding tests to identify the MHC alleles that bind to these 8 epitopes may reveal additional distinct alleles, beyond the five determined so far, that may help to improve population coverage.
To further expand the search and identify potentially effective T cell targets covering a higher percentage of the population, we next additionally considered the set of T cell epitopes that have been experimentally-determined from positive MHC binding assays (Table 1) , but, unlike the previous epitope set, their ability to induce a T cell response against SARS-CoV was not experimentally determined.
Nonetheless, they also present promising candidates for inducing a response against SARS-CoV-2.
For the expanded set of epitopes, all of which have at least one positive MHC binding assay, we found that 264 epitope-sequences have an identical match in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and have associated MHC allele information available (listed in Table S2 ). Of these 264 epitopes, ~80% were MHC Class I restricted epitopes (Table S3) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.933226 doi: bioRxiv preprint alleles and was estimated to provide an accumulated population coverage of 96.29% (Table 3) . We also computed the population coverage of this specific set of epitopes in China, the country most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, which was estimated to be slightly lower (88.11%) as certain MHC alleles (e.g., HLA-A*02:01) associated with some of these epitopes are less frequent in the Chinese population (Table 3) . Repeating the same greedy approach but focusing on the Chinese population, instead of a global population, the maximum population coverage was estimated to be 92.76% (Table   S4 ).
Due to the promiscuous nature of binding between peptides and MHC alleles, multiple S and N peptides were reported to bind to individual MHC alleles. Thus, while we list all the S and N epitopes that bind to each MHC allele (Table 3) , the estimated maximum population coverage may be achieved by selecting at least one epitope for each listed MHC allele. Likewise, many individual S and N epitopes were found to be presented by multiple alleles and thereby estimated to have varying global population coverage (Table S5) .
cell epitopes, we used in our study the SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes that have been experimentally-determined from positive B cell assays (Pickett et al., 2012) . These epitopes were classified as: (i) linear B cell epitopes (antigenic peptides), and (ii) discontinuous B cell epitopes (conformational epitopes with resolved structural determinants).
We aligned the 298 linear B cell epitopes (Table 1) across the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that 50 epitope-sequences, all derived from structural proteins, have an identical match and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (as of 9 February 2020). Interestingly, a large number (45) of these were derived from either the S (23) or N (22) protein (Table 4) , while the remaining (5) were from the M and E proteins (Table S6) .
On the other hand, all 6 SARS-CoV-derived discontinuous B cell epitopes obtained from the ViPR database (Table 5) were derived from the S protein. Based on the pairwise alignment between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences ( Figure S2 ), we found that none of these mapped identically to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, in contrast to the linear epitopes. For 3 of these discontinuous B cell epitopes there was a partial mapping, with at least one site having an identical residue at the corresponding site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Table 5) .
Mapping the residues of the B cell epitopes onto the available structure of the SARS-CoV S protein revealed that the linear epitopes (Table 4 ) map to seemingly less-exposed regions, away from the most exposed region, the ""spike head"" (Figure 3a) . In contrast, all discontinuous B cell epitopes (Table 5) map onto the spike head region (Figure 3b, top panel) , which contains the receptor-binding motif of the SARS-CoV S protein (F. Li, 2005) . We observe that few residues of the discontinuous epitopes that lie . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

It has been reported recently that SARS-CoV-2 is able to bind to the same receptor as SARS-CoV (ACE2) for cell entry, despite having multiple amino acid differences with SARS-CoV's receptor-binding motif (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Letko & Munster, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Whether the antibodies specific to this motif maintain their binding and elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 warrants further experimental investigation.
The quest for a vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as an urgent problem. Effective vaccination could indeed play a significant role in curbing the spread of the virus, and help to eliminate it from the human population. However, scientific efforts to address this challenge are only just beginning. Much remains to be learnt about the virus, its biological properties, epidemiology, etc. At this early stage, there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, which presents a challenge for vaccine development.
This study has sought to assist with the initial phase of vaccine development, by providing recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in subunit vaccine designs. Despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to SARS-CoV-2, these epitopes are motivated by their responses that they have recorded in SARS-CoV (or, for the case of T cell epitopes, to at least confer MHC binding), and the fact that they map identically to SARS-CoV-2, based on the available sequence data (as of 9 February 2020). The identical map between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of any mutation in the identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), suggests their potential for eliciting a robust T cell or antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.
Research efforts directed towards the design and development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are increasing, and some related analyses are already being reported in distinct, parallel studies. Notably, a preliminary analysis of linear B cell epitopes has been reported online on the ViPR database website (https://www.viprbrc.org/brcDocs/documents/announcements/Corona/2019-nCoV-ViPR-report_24JAN2020.pdf). Different from our study, which is focused on the linear and discontinuous SARS-CoV-derived epitopes, that analysis considered linear B cell epitope data for all Betacoronaviruses from human hosts. While only a summary of the results has been provided so far, preventing direct comparison of the individual epitopes, the number of linear B cell epitopes reported to map identically to SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to our findings.
A recent study has also predicted T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 that may be presented by a population from the Asia-Pacific region (Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020) . Again, there are multiple differences to our work. First, the focus of that study was on MHC Class II epitopes, while here we . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.933226 doi: bioRxiv preprint considered both MHC Class I and II epitopes. Interestingly, while we found a few MHC Class II epitopes using our approach (Table S3) , only one of these (HLA-DRB1*01:01) appeared in our identified epitope set (Table 3) , due to their comparatively low estimated population coverage. Second, computational tools were used to predict MHC Class II epitopes in (Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020) , while here we analysed the SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that have been determined experimentally, using either positive T cell or MHC binding assays, and which match identically with the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020).
We acknowledge that this is a preliminary analysis based on the limited sequence data available for SARS-CoV-2 (as of 9 February 2020). As the virus continues to evolve and as more data is collected, it is expected that additional mutations will be observed. Such mutations will not affect our analysis, provided that they occur outside of the identified epitope regions. If mutations do occur within epitope regions, then these epitopes may be further screened in line with the conservative filtering principle that we have employed, thereby producing a more refined epitope set.
Further experimental studies (T cell and B cell assays) are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This would help to further refine the reported epitope set, based on observed immunogenicity; an important consideration for immunogen design. Overall, as the identified set of epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, they present potentially useful candidates for guiding experimental efforts towards developing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

18dc6a67045d2687d2b5c11c85797f42824ed243,"Background: The current outbreak caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has become a worldwide concern. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.
We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.
Results: An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10 -2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.","Coronaviruses (CoV) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae) are enveloped, positive stranded RNA viruses, which includes 4 genera Alphacoronavirus (α-CoV),
Betacoronavirus (β-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (γ-CoV), and Deltacoronavirus (δ-CoV) [1, 2] . Since 1960, six different CoVs have been identified and two epidemic CoVs have emerged in human during the last 2 decades [3] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome [4, 5] .
On 31 December 2019, Wuhan City of Hubei Province reported a number of cases of pneumonia related to a local seafood market. The main clinical manifestation of these cases was fever, a few patients had dyspnea, and the chest films showed double-lung infiltrative lesions [6] . The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus (novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV), which was isolated on 7 January 2020, and on 11 and 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) received further detailed information from the National Health Commission about the outbreak. As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and had affected 11 countries or regions [7, 8] .
All human CoVs may be of zoonotic origin, and may indeed originate from bats [9] .
To discover the evolutionary history of the viruses, we analyzed the genomes of 2019-nCoVs, compared their variations in both nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, and determined their molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor. We tried to explore the origin and evolution mechanism of the viruses causing the epidemic, and to provide theoretical basis for early warning of similar events caused by β -CoVs in the future.

The SARS-CoV in 2002 -2003 and two Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolates bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank accession: MG772933) and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank accession: MG772934) were also downloaded for serving as the reference sequences. The former is a reference sequence (RefSeq) of pathogens that have caused major epidemics [10] , while the latter two are the wild strains with the highest identity with 2019-nCoVs [11] . Moreover, unlike GISAID, the three sequences downloaded from GenBank have detailed comments, which can be used to investigate the coding sequences (CDS) of different proteins.
The CLUSTAL W profile alignment option was used to align the whole genomes. On this basis, the coding sequence (CDS) of ployprotein (P, ORF1ab), spike protein (S), nucleoprotein (N), matrix protein (M) and small envelope protein (E) in the genomes are trimmed out from each reference sequence, since they are very important enzymatic or structural proteins in coronavirus [10, 12] . Pairwise distances were calculated by using the DNADIST program of the PHYLIP package and by using the Kimura two-parameter model of nucleotide substitution. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using neighbour-joining (NJ) methods. All phylogenetic trees were inferred by using MEGA6 software [13] . The deduced amino acid residues of these 5 proteins were compared by Lasergene 7 program again [14] .
Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST v1.6.1 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk) software package, was used to determine the molecular evolutionary rate [15] . Because the viral genomes sequenced in this outbreak are relatively concentrated in time, no reference sequence other than the outbreak has been included.

Bayesian skyline population size was set as demographic models for each species-specific data set. Model selection was based on an analysis of marginal likelihoods, calculated in Tracer version 1.5. Effective sample sizes (ESSs) of at least 200 were considered appropriate and the results were considered valid. For tMRCA analysis, the collection dates of 2019-nCoVs were calculated by using the following formula, and the values of date were accepted by Tipdate time collector:
[(month-1)×30＋date]/360＋Year (i.e., 2019 or 2020)

As of January 24, 2020, there were 26 viral genomes of 2019-nCoVs. After excluding one with incomplete information (EPI_ISL_402125) and another excessively short one (EPI_ISL_402126), a total of 24 viral genomes were included in the follow-up study.
The phylogenetic trees showed that all isolates of 2019-nCoVs automatically clustered on whole genome and CDS of five proteins, indicating their close relationship.
However, in the whole genome and the CDS of P, S and N, an isolate (EPI_ISL_403928) is different from other 23 (Fig 1) . This isolate was derived from a 61-year-old male patient in Wuhan. The sample was collected on 1 January, 2020, and the possibility of false sequencing was ruled out. The genetic distances of genomes show results consistent to the phylogenetic trees. The mean genetic distance is 0.00021±0.00002 for all the isolates but only 0.00010±0.00001 after an exclusion of EPI_ISL_403928. The mean genetic distance between EPI_ISL_403928 and the other 23 is 0.00146±0.00018. The CDS of P, S and N show a similar difference between EPI_403928 and the group of 23 (Tab 1). All isolates of 2019-nCoV however, have the same CDS of M and E.

Its precursor contained the most amino acid residues, up to 7096. There are 22 variations between EPI_ISL_403928 and the other 2019-nCoVs (Fig 2) .
Two important structural proteins, S and N, are composed of 1273 and 419 amino acid residues, respectively. When compared with the other 2019-nCoVs, EPI_ISL_403928 has four variations in S protein (T572I, G799V, F800C and N801K) and two variations in N protein (A414C and D415I). M and E proteins show no variation so far.
Nucleotide substitution rates of the whole genome and CDS for different proteins differed from each other (Tab 2). The substitution rate from high to low was 1·05 × 10 -2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 × 10 -4 to 2.72 × 10 -2 , similarly hereinafter) for N, 5.34 × 10 -3 (5.10 × 10 -4 , 1.28 × 10 -2 ) for S, 1.69 × 10 -3 
In this study, we analyzed the whole genome and the CDS of several key proteins of 2019-nCoVs. 2019-nCoVs are the pathogens that cause severe pneumonia in human in Wuhan recently. It is found one of the isolates (EPI_ISL_403928) has obvious variations in whole genome and CDS of P, S and N proteins, which result in the substitution of several amino acids.
We also analyzed the nucleotide substitution rate in the whole genome level and the CDS of some proteins during their evolution process. There is no variation in CDS of M and E proteins. CDS of N protein has the highest rate of base substitution (1·05 × 10 -2 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The divergence time of the viruses deduced is about 91-214 days before the submission of the first isolate. Their earliest sampling time was 8 December, 2019, and 91-214 days before that day, the viruses infected human or host animals and began to diverge in the evolution process. It is not clear if the viruses began to mutate before or after infecting human beings. There is also a possibility there were two strains evolved coincidentally, one for human and one for host animals that evolved more adaptive to human and then infected human. Our analysis indicates that the outbreak occurred a few months earlier than it was officially reported, and there might be recessive infection and underdetection in the population. Therefore, the seafood market in Wuhan, which is believed to be the first spot of the outbreak, may or may not be the case.
Human recessive infection of Betacoronavirus does exist. For example, it occurs in the population for HKU1, another member of β -CoVs. HKU1 is related to a variety of children's and adult diseases and distributed globally [16] . In the United States, 0.5% were infected by HKU1 [18] ; in Southeast Asia, the positive rate of HKU1 was 1.1%
in 2060 adult acute respiratory samples from Malaysia in 2012-2013 [19] . The positive detection rate was 1.9% in Japan and 4342 from 2010 to 2013, and 2.5% in Korea [20, 21] . Recessive HKU1 infection was common and many patients with HKU1 infection were found in routine examinations [24] [25] . Cases of recessive
one of the reasons for underdetection.
All human CoVs (HCoVs) is mainly of zoonotic origin, and most likely originate from bats [9] .

Our study suggests that there are at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV infecting human and human infection occurred a few months earlier than the outbreak being officially announced. Recessive infection and underdetection can cause a delay in response. The seafood market in Wuhan may or may not be the first spot of this outbreak.
A large number of viruses carried by wild animals bring many uncertainties to the emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). In order to effectively control these EIDs, it is necessary to strengthen interdisciplinary cooperation and communication among human, animal and environmental health investigators based on the One Health concept, so as to detect and identify pathogens as early as possible, find patients and report epidemics, and effectively control the spread of EIDs through timely isolation and prevention measures and observation of close contacts.

In two of the mutants, Jumble and Couscous, single 29 cells failed to develop into orderly rosettes but instead aggregated promiscuously into 30 amorphous clumps of cells. Both mutants mapped to lesions in genes encoding 31 glycosyltransferases and the mutations perturbed glycosylation patterns in the 32 extracellular matrix (ECM). In animals, glycosyltransferases transfer activated sugars to 33 donor molecules and thereby sculpt the polysaccharide-rich ECM, regulate integrin and 34 cadherin activity, and, when disrupted, contribute to tumorigenesis. The finding that 35 glycosyltransferases promote proper rosette development and prevent cell aggregation 36 in S. rosetta suggests a pre-metazoan role for glycosyltransferases in regulating 37 development and preventing abnormal tumor-like multicellularity.","The evolution of multicellular eukaryotes from their single-celled ancestors was a 42 major transition in evolutionary history and allowed for the subsequent origin and 43 diversification of complex macroscopic life (Leigh et al., 1995) . However, despite the 44 centrality of multicellularity to the origin and diversification of animals, little is known 45 about the genetic and developmental mechanisms that precipitated the transition to 46 multicellularity in the animal stem lineage. Although the first animals evolved over 600 47
Couscous (previously named Branched in Levin et al., 2014 ) -that form amorphous, 110 tightly packed clumps of cells, both in the presence and absence of RIFs, but never 111 develop into rosettes (Table 1 ; Figure 1A ,B). We found that the clumps contain a few to 112 hundreds of mutant cells that pack together haphazardly, unlike wild type rosettes in 1-figure supplement 1). Therefore, the cell clumps are not aberrant rosettes, which 127 never form through aggregation and instead require at least 15 -24 hours to develop 128 clonally through serial rounds of cell division (Dayel et al., 2011; Fairclough et al., 2010) . 129

To test whether a bulk segregant approach would work in S. rosetta, we first 158 analyzed a cross between the previously mapped Rosetteless mutant and the Mapping 159
Strain (Levin et al., 2014) . We isolated 38 F1s with the rosette defect phenotype from a 160
Mapping Strain´Rosetteless cross (Levin et al., 2014) , grew clonal cultures from each, 161 pooled the resulting cultures, extracted their genomic DNA, and sequenced the pooled 162 mutant genomes to an average coverage of 187X. Against a background of sequence 163 variants that did not segregate perfectly with the Rosetteless phenotype, five unlinked 164 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) were found to 165 perfectly segregate with the phenotype (Table S2 ). Four of these detected sequence 166 variants likely had spurious correlations with the phenotype resulting from relatively low 167 sequencing coverage at those variants (>0.25X coverage of the entire genome) ( Table  168 S2). In contrast, the remaining SNV was detected in a well-assembled portion of the 169 genome at a sequencing depth approaching the average coverage of the entire 170 genome. The perfectly segregating SNV, at position 427,804 on supercontig 8, was 171 identical to the causative mutation identified in Levin et al., 2014 (Table S2) . Thus, a 172 method based on pooling F1 haploid mutants, identifying sequence variants that 173 perfectly segregated with the phenotype, and masking those SNVs/INDELs that were 174 detected with >0.25X coverage of the total genome was effective for correctly 175 pinpointing the causal mutation for Rosetteless (Figure 2-figure supplement 1 Jumble that segregated perfectly with both the clumping and rosette defects. Only one 199 of these -at position 1,919,681 on supercontig 1 -had sequencing coverage of at least 200 .

In a backcross of mutant F1 progeny to the Mapping Strain, we confirmed the tight 202 linkage of the SNV to the rosette defect phenotype ( Figure 2B ). Moreover, all F2 203 progeny that displayed a rosette defect also had a clumping phenotype. Given the tight 204 linkage of both traits with the SNV and the absence of any detectable neighboring 205 sequence variants, we infer that the single point mutation at genome position 206 1:1,919,681 causes both the clumping and rosette defect phenotypes in Jumble 207
The mutation causes a T to C transition in a gene hereafter called jumble 209 (GenBank accession EGD72416/NCBI accession XM_004998928; Figure 2A Figure 2C ,D). We were able to enrich for rare transfected cells by 219 using a construct in which the puromycin resistance gene (pac) was expressed under 220 the same promoter as the jumble fusion gene, with the two coding sequences separated 221 by a sequence encoding a self-cleaving peptide (Kim et al., 2011) .

It is somewhat more difficult to infer how increased clumping in single cells might 408 interfere with rosette development. One possibility is that the disruption of ECM 409 glycosylation that we hypothesize might promote clumping may also prevent the proper 410 maturation of the ECM needed for rosette development ( crosses; here, we report which method was used to generate data for each individual 508 cross.

we were able to generate putative outcrossed diploids by crossing to the Mapping Strain 524 based on the genotyping marker on supercontig 1, but we only could only clonally 525 isolate populations of F1 haploids with rosettes and never isolated any F1 haploids with 526 the clumpy, rosetteless phenotype. 527 cells, were identified through genotyping by PCR at a supercontig 1 microsatellite as 538 described above. To induce meiosis, heterozygotes were diluted 1:2 in 25% CG media 539 in ASW (vol/vol) every 1-2 days for 8 days. As soon as rosettes and swimming cells 540
were observed, we repeated the serial dilution to isolate clones (probability of clonal 541 isolation 0.85-0.98). We collected any clonally isolated populations that formed rosettes 542 or clumps and ignored any wells containing thecate cells assuming that these 543 .

Isolates were genotyped with the marker on supercontig 1 to 547 ensure that independent assortment of the genotype and the phenotype indeed 548 occurred. In total, 30 clumpy F1s were collected for bulk segregation analysis. 549
For the successful Couscous cross, we induced mating using V. fisheri Couscous and Mapping Strain cells at stationary growth were pelleted and resuspended 552 in 5% V. fischeri conditioned media in ASW (vol/vol). After 24 hr, the cells were pelleted, 553 resuspended in 5% HN media in ASW (vol/vol), and allowed to recover for 24 hr. We 554 then isolated clones by limiting dilution in 10% CG media in ASW (vol/vol). The 555 probability of clonal isolation in this step was between 0.97-0.98. We extracted DNA as 556 described above and identified heterozygous clones through genotyping by PCR at a 557 single microsatellite genotyping marker on supercontig 1. Four clonally isolated 558 heterozygous populations, containing almost exclusively thecate cells, were identified. 559
To induce meiosis, heterozygotes were passaged 1:2 in 25% CG media in ASW 560 (vol/vol) every 1-2 days for 8 days. As soon as rosettes and swimming cells were 561 observed, we repeated clonal isolation (probability of clonal isolation 0.78-0.97). We 562 collected any clonally isolated populations that formed rosettes or clumps and ignored 563 any wells containing thecate cells assuming that these represented diploid cells that had 564 not undergone meiosis. Only 14.6% of non-thecate isolates were clumps; this deviation 565 from a Mendelian ratio (Χ 2 =225.63, df=1, p<0. 5.34 -51 ) may indicate a potential fitness 566 .

After 24 hr, the V. fischeri conditioned media was 616 replaced with 25% CG media in ASW (vol/vol) and cells were plated to limiting dilution. 617
Clonally isolated thecate populations were genotyped by PCR of the microsatellite on 618 supercontig 1 as described above and 4 heterozygous diploids populations were 619 identified (probability of clonal isolation 0.79-0.95). The heterozygotes were rapidly 620 passaged for 2 weeks to induce meiosis before being plated for clonal isolation 621 (probability of clonal isolation 0.95-0.98). 12 F2s with the clumpy phenotype and 9 F2s 622 with the rosette phenotype were identified ( Figure 2B ). Their DNA was extracted using 623 Base-Tris method described above and the region around the causal mutation was 624 amplified. The resultant PCR product was digested for 4 hr with BfaI, which cleaves the 625 mutant allele but not the wild type allele, and products of the digest were distinguished 626 by agarose gel electrophoresis. 627

On January 12, 2020, WHO officially named the disease Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan in China on December 12, 2019 [1] [2] as causing severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause illnesses such as cold and more serious diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). COVID-19 is a new strain of coronavirus that has never been found in the human body before [3] [4] .
COVID-19 patients typically show symptoms such as fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and difficulty in breathing. In more severe cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory failure, kidney failure, and even death [5] . There is as yet no specific treatment for COVID-19. Patients mainly receive symptomatic treatment and care for the prevention of complications, while supplementary medical services also appear to be very effective for infected people. The rate of COVID-19 infections has increased rapidly in a short period of time. As of February 17, 2020, the number of confirmed cases exceeded 70,000, with 1,770 deaths [6] . In addition, the disease can cause secondary infections, which has created a huge burden and pressure for the prevention and treatment of the disease in various places. At present, more than 30,000 medical personnel from various medical teams across the country have provided support in Wuhan [7] . Though the help from these medical personnel has relieved the local pressure for medical care to save critically ill COVID-19 patients, there have been serious infections among the medical staff in Wuhan and other places in Hubei Province. At present, over 3000 medical personnel have been infected, which has greatly increased the psychological pressure they experience. In the face of the catastrophic health emergency of COVID-19, medical personnel have been affected by different kinds of subjective and objective factors and confront several mental health problems. Mental illness is a form of human stress response, an explanatory, emotional, and defensive response within the human body, and a physiological response of the human body to the impact of needs or injuries.
Therefore, this study aims to analyze the psychological state of medical personnel dealing with COVID-19 and its influencing factors in order to provide an objective basis for the prevention of further transmission, interventions, and countermeasures for COVID-19.
This study adopted convenience sampling to recruit research subjects. From January 25 to February 16, 2020, 560 medical personnel from 12 hospitals in eight provinces and cities across the country were enrolled as research subjects. or emergency department, level of concern whether you and your family have been infected, degree of suspicion that you were infected when coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, and whether you have received medical observation recently.
The SCL-90 self-report inventory: The SCL-90 inventory, compiled by Derogatis in 1975, includes 10 factors and a total of 90 items. Each factor reflects the symptoms and pain of a patient in a certain aspect, and the distribution of symptoms can be understood through the factor scores. The 10 factors include somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism, sleep, and diet. Each item was scored using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging none, mild, moderate, moderate to severe, to severe. The total score is the sum of the scores of the 90 items. In previous studies, the homogeneity reliability of the total SCL-90 scale was 0.97, and the homogeneity reliability of each sub-scale was also greater than 0.68. The test-retest reliability was greater than 0.7, and the content validity was above 0.85, which suggest sound reliability and validity.
The study used online questionnaires for data collection. Researchers conducted surveys upon the completion of general training. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University(HRBYKD-A26). The research purpose and methods were explained to subjects to seek their cooperation. Online informed consent forms were signed by participants. They were informed that their participation was completely voluntary, and they could withdraw from the study at any time. The link of the online questionnaire was then sent to a total of 560 medical personnel via the Internet.
(1) In this study, data analysis was performed after logical checks using the statistical software SPSS 22.0. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant.
(2) Statistical description: The mean value, standard deviation, and frequency were used to describe the demographic data of medical personnel, while the mean value and standard deviation were used to describe the scores for the mental health status of medical personnel responding to COVID-19.
(3) Statistical inference: Multivariate linear regression was adopted to analyze the impact of the demographic data of medical personnel on their mental health status.
A total of 560 questionnaires were distributed, and 548 valid questionnaires were recovered, for an effective recovery rate of 97.90%. These 548 questionnaires were completed by medical personnel from eight provinces and cities in China, namely Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Shandong.

Stepwise linear regression was performed using the total score of mental health status as the dependent variable and 17 items of personal information as independent variables. The 17 items include: hospital, department, occupation, gender, age, highest education level, work experience, level of expertise, marital status, any children, living status, whether you have participated in training for handling of public health emergencies, whether family members support your working on the front line against coronavirus, whether you have supported in affected areas in Hubei, designated hospitals, department of infectious diseases, fever clinics or emergency department, level of concern whether you and your family have been infected, degree of suspicion that you were infected when coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, and whether you have received medical observation recently. Values were assigned to independent variables using the method shown in Table 3 . The α -values for importing and exporting a variable in the regression equation were set to 0.10 and 0.15, respectively. Factors affecting the mental health and status of medical personnel based on their significance from high to low are: the degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been infected, age, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether family members support them working on the front line (p < 0.05).

As it is highly contagious, many people are frightened by it and even talk fearfully about coronavirus, which can also be observed in front-line medical staff. The results of the study have shown that the overall mean of the SCL-90 and the mean values of the factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of medical personnel were significantly higher than that of the norm group (p < 0.05), while the average score of the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was significantly lower than that of the norm group (p < 0.01). More specifically, medical personnel are most of the people closest to COVID-19 patients, so they are at high risk of exposure to the disease. Moreover, they have a deep understanding of the dangers of COVID-19, so they are prone to anxiety and fear. The infection protection procedures for COVID-19 are highly complex and medical staff need to constantly change clothes and replace protective equipment, so they are more likely to establish obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Medical personnel, especially young medical staff, have less experience in the field and in dealing with difficulties and hardships in life.
Therefore, when they suddenly encounter such sudden public health events, they tend to suffer anxiety and phobic anxiety, leading to physical and mental problems. That is why scores of the factors somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism were significantly higher than in the norm group. This result suggests that psychologists and team leaders should pay more attention to the anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism issues of the medical personnel in a team. The average score for the interpersonal sensitivity factor of medical personnel was significantly lower than that of the norm group. This shows that in the event of an infectious disease epidemic, the majority of medical personnel are united and have good professional strengths and qualities for self-regulation and self-protection. The results of this study show partial consistency with the studies of the mental health status of front-line medical personnel for SARS in 2003 [9] .

Specific reasons are given in the following sections.
3.2.1 Degree of suspicion that they were infected when the novel coronavirus-related symptoms occurred, the level of concern whether they and their family members have been infected, whether they have supported in affected areas in Hubei Province, designated hospitals, and other places for the novel coronavirus, and whether family members support them working on the front line COVID-19 patients are the main source of transmission of the disease. Patients with latent infection (i.e., asymptomatic infection) may also constitute a source of infection [10] . Medical personnel are in frequent close contact with patients during their treatment and care, hence the high risk of infection [11] . Among 138 patients admitted consecutively from January 1 to 28, 2020, to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, the proportion of medical personnel was as high as 29% [12] . A retrospective analysis of 1099 confirmed COVID-19 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces (diagnosis as of January 29) found that the proportion of medical staff was 2.09% [13] . Therefore, medical staff are at high risk of infection and are under great psychological pressure. If they become infected as a result of supporting affected areas in Hubei and COVID-19 designated hospitals, it will not only affect their physical and mental health but also that of their families. Therefore, with the emergence of symptoms and the increase in the level of concern, the mental health status of clinical medical staff may deteriorate. Furthermore, if their families do not support them working on the front line against the disease, then the psychological burden of the medical staff will also increase due to the resulting sense of conflict with professional ethics, resulting in further impact on their physical and mental health.
We found that the higher the age, the higher the mental health score and the more psychological problems. Based on the age distribution of patients across the country, all ages have no resistance to the novel coronavirus, and a person of any age can be infected as long as virus transmission conditions are met [14] . An analysis of 4021 confirmed patients nationwide (diagnosis date as of January 26) also shows that people of all ages are generally vulnerable to the disease, of whom 71.45% are aged 30 to 65 years [14] . As people get older, the risk of exposure to the disease may increase in people with underlying illness such as asthma, diabetes, and heart diseases [15] . Therefore, older medical personnel have more psychological stress when dealing with COVID-19 patients. It is advised that older medical personnel receive psychological counseling before and during work to help them adjust their status as soon as possible. Despite all the above, this study believes that after such a ""smokeless"" war against the novel coronavirus, the psychological quality of medical personnel can be improved to a certain extent.
In the face of the catastrophic health emergency caused by COVID-19, medical staff have been affected by different kinds of subjective and objective factors. Their mental health problems are a form of human stress response, an explanatory, emotional, and defensive response within the human body, and a physiological response of the human body to the invasion of needs or injuries. In this special environment, their work, life, and emotions tend to be regularly abnormal. Due to the requirements for isolation and disinfection, medical personnel need to wear several layers of protection clothing.
This increases the intensity of their work and requires great physical energy, causing severe hypoxia and physical symptoms such as headache and muscle soreness. Other symptoms such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, hostility, and paranoid ideation are all normal psychological reactions in the handling of emergencies and environmental stimuli. In face of a disaster, persons with good mental health will tend to actively take measures such as catharsis, transference, compensation, relaxation, humor, self-consolation, and rational response.

Psychological tests show that people have a process of adaptation to catastrophic emergencies, from initial rejection, shock, and fear, to habituation, acceptance, and calm, to co-existence and living together, which is a regular process. In the face of such a sudden disaster as COVID-19, these psychological symptoms have manifested in both doctors and patients.

Sia may be present in variant forms that include O-acetyl modifications at C4, C7, C8, and C9 positions, and N-acetyl or N-glycolyl at C5. They can also vary in their linkages, including α2-3 or α2-6-linkages. Here, we analyzed the distribution of modified Sia in cells and tissues of wild-type mice, or in mice lacking cytidine 5'-30 monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) enzyme that synthesizes Nglycolyl modifications (Neu5Gc). We also examined the variation of Sia forms on erythrocytes and saliva from different animals. To determine the effect of Sia modifications on influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we tested for effects on hemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl, 7,9-O-acetyl, 4-O-acetyl, and Neu5Gc 35 modifications are widely but variably expressed in mouse tissues, with the highest levels detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Secreted mucins in saliva and surface proteins of erythrocytes showed a great degree of variability in display of modified Sia between different species. IAV HA from different virus strains showed consistently reduced binding to both Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modified Sia; however, while IAV NA were inhibited by Neu5Gc and 40 O-acetyl modifications, there was significant variability between NA types. The modifications of Sia in mucus may therefore have potent effects on the functions of IAV, and may affect both pathogens and the normal flora of different mucosal sites. (241 words) IMPORTANCE 45
Sialic acids (Sia) are involved in many different cellular functions and are receptors for many pathogens. Sia come in many chemically modified forms but we lack a clear understanding of how they alter the interactions with microbes. Here we examine the expression of modified Sia in mouse tissues, on secreted mucus in saliva, and on erythrocytes, including those from IAV host species and animals used in IAV research. These Sia forms varied considerably between","3 different animals, and their inhibitory effects on IAV NA and HA activities and on bacterial sialidases (neuraminidases) suggest a host-variable protective role in secreted mucus.

Sialic acids (Sia) are a family of nine-carbon monosaccharides that often serve as terminal residues of carbohydrate chains. They are present at high levels on cell membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids, as well as on secreted glycoproteins and mucus at all mucosal surfaces (Fig. 1A ) (1, 2) . Sia are key mediators of many normal cell and tissue functions through a wide variety of highly regulated cell-cell interactions during both development and 60 homeostatic processes, where they may be bound by cellular receptors and members of the selectin family (3, 4) . Their ubiquitous presence on cells, tissues, and mucosal surfaces also make Sia a key point of contact for commensal microbes and for invading pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and parasites (3, 5, 6).
Sia are a highly diverse family of molecules that may be present as more than 50 of combinations of Sia forms including Neu4,5Ac 2 , Neu5,9Ac 2 , Neu5,7,9Ac 3 Sia, as well as their N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) analogs with the same O-acetyl modifications (Fig. 1B) .

The addition of O-Ac to the C7 and/or C9 positions is mediated by the sialylate O-acetyltransferase enzyme, Cas1 domain containing 1 (CasD1), which has been suggested to add an O-acetyl group to the C7 position, from which it would migrate to the C8 and C9 position under physiological conditions, allowing the possibility 85 of the addition of another O-acetyl group to C7 (7, 13, 14) . The regulatory processes that control the number or positions of acetyl groups have not been well defined, although distinct differences in expression of 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac Sia have been reported in mouse and human tissues, chicken embryos, and in some other animals (7) . CasD1 uses acetyl-CoA to modify Sia in the activated CMP-Sia form before it is added to the glycan chain, and likely has a preference 90 for CMP-Neu5Ac as a substrate and is less active on CMP-Neu5Gc (14). The sialate Oacetylesterase (SIAE) enzyme can remove the 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac modifications, although its activities and roles are not well understood (17) (18) (19) (20) . The 4-O-Ac Sia is produced in some tissues of many animals by a distinct sialate 4-O-acetyltransferase that is also likely expressed in the Golgi compartment; however, the gene for this enzyme has also not yet been identified 95 (21) (22) (23) . The 7, 8 , and/or 9-O-Ac Sia appear to be present at low levels -a few percent or less -in the cell-associated Sia on many cultured cells, but may be present at higher levels (10 to 50%) in Sia on the secreted mucus of various animals and on erythrocyte-associated glycans (15, 24) . However, the expression, distribution, and regulations of these modified Sia are not well 6 pathogens (26, 27) . Many pathogens therefore express proteins that attach to Sia, as well as expressing receptor-modifying enzymes such as sialidases (neuraminidases) that remove the Sia from the underlying glycan. Bacterial adhesins and toxins may recognize Sia on the surface of cells, and many bacteria can also use Sia as a metabolic carbon source after release through 110 the activity of neuraminidases, and uptake into the cell by Sia transporters (3, 28-31). These bacterial interactions with Sia are potentially affected by chemical modifications (30, 32) . Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses may also bind Sia as primary receptors or co-receptors for cell recognition and infection, although only the enveloped viruses appear to express neuraminidases or sialate O-acetyl esterases, possibly to reduce aggregation of viral particles 115 during budding (5, 33) . For some viruses, Sia modifications are required for infection as viral proteins specifically bind to modified Sia -examples include human coronavirus OC43 and HKU1, and influenza C and D viruses, which all require 9-O-Ac Sia for cell infection (34, 35) .
Significant effects of different Sia modifications on the binding of pathogens or the activities of their sialidases (neuraminidases) have been suggested, but in general these are still 120 not well understood. Influenza A viruses (IAV) use Sia as primary receptors for host recognition and cell entry through the activity of two surface glycoproteins that interact with Sia, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is a trimeric protein that binds Sia to initiate the endocytic uptake of the virus by the cell, leading to fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane after exposure of the virus to low pH (36) . NA is a sialidase which 125 cleaves Sia from the mucus, cell surface, and from viral glycoproteins, allowing the virus to penetrate through mucus to the epithelial cells and reducing the aggregation of virions after budding from the surface of cells (37). Previous studies have suggested that 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac Sia are expressed on cells or in tissues of many IAV host species and there is some evidence that these modifications may be inhibitory for NA activity and HA binding (38, 39) . However, the 130 specific effects of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac on the binding of Sia by HA or the cleavage of Sia by IAV NA have not been examined in detail, and it is unclear whether these changes influence All rights reserved.

The difference between Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac has been found to influence the tropism of several different viruses, as well as some bacterial toxins (3, 5). Indeed, it has been proposed that the loss of the CMAH gene in humans was an adaptive response to pathogen pressures (40). Neu5Gc is highly expressed in some tissues of IAV natural host species, including pigs 140 and horses, and is also present in the tissues of mice and guinea pigs, which are frequently used as animals models (9, 12, 41) . Neu5Gc has been seen to prevent binding of the HAs of some IAV, particularly in human-adapted strains (39, 42) , but the effects on NA have not been well characterized. Nevertheless, examination of swine IAV isolates found distinct strain differences in their ability to cleave Neu5Gc by sialidase activity which were generally lower 145 than against Neu5Ac (43) .
Here we define the expression of 7,9-O-Ac, 9-O-Ac, and Neu5Gc modified Sia in the mucus, saliva, and on erythrocytes of different IAV host animals, as well as on the tissues and secreted mucus of mice. We also test the effects of these modifications on HA binding and NA activity of different strains of IAV, as well as their potential to alter virus infection.

These modified Sia were also found throughout the GI tract, with staining associated with 160 epithelial cells, goblet cells, and associated mucus layers of the gastrointestinal tissues, including the stomach, small intestine, and colon (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, 9-O-Ac appeared to be present in higher amounts in most tissues, including salivary gland and esophagus, while the 7,9-O-Ac staining was minimal. However, 7,9-O-Ac did stain stronger than 9-O-Ac in stomachassociated mucus, and on tracheal epithelial cells. This seems to indicate that while the same Table 1) , while, as expected, the CMAH -/mice showed only Neu5Ac in all tissues, similar to amounts reported previously for some of those tissues (44) (Supplemental Table 2 ). The lack of Neu5Gc in CMAH -/mice was also seen in GI tissues, indicating that Neu5Gc from dietary sources was not 180 detectably being taken up by these mice, as is seen in humans who eat a diet containing that Neu5Gc (46) . In the WT mice, tissues showed a great deal of variability in Neu5Gc expression.
Most tissues had around 50-60% Neu5Gc; however, some tissues, including the liver, had higher levels of over 70%, while the brain and salivary glands had only 10%. All O-acetyl Sia All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

There was about 1.5 to 3 fold higher levels of O-acetyl Sia in most tissues of the CMAH knock-out mice ( Fig. 3C; Supplemental Table 2 ), as has been reported previously (44). The levels of 4-O-Ac Sia were generally low, making up ~2% of the Sia in small intestine (duodenum) and ~1% in spleen, testes, and esophagus. Mouse colon samples showed the highest levels of total O-acetylation, 190 with ~17% of Sia having one or more O-acetyl modification, again primarily 9-O-Ac. Given the patterns seen using the HE-Fc virolectin staining, the 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac forms must be present at high levels within or on certain cell sub-populations, as well as within mucus or mucussecreting cells. For example, the high levels of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac found in the mouse colon were most likely associated with secreted mucus as most of those modified Sia were present in 195 goblet cells (Fig. 2B) . However, the differences seen between probe binding and the ratios of the different modified Sia within the total Sia underscore the importance of quantifying the different forms.
Analysis of modified Sia in saliva, mucus, and on erythrocytes. It has been previously reported that human colonic mucin is highly enriched in 9-O-Ac Sia, which may 200 regulate the activity of some sialidases and Sia transporters of the gut microflora (11, 32, 47, 48) . Strong staining for 9-O-Ac in human respiratory tissues, and also within the submucosal glands of human respiratory tissue have also been reported, indicating that mucus from these glands could be enriched in O-acetylated Sia (47, 48) . To determine if human respiratory mucus was enriched in 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac, secreted mucus from primary normal human bronchial 205 epithelial cells (NHBE) as well as conditioned media from human alveolar basal epithelial adenocarcinoma A549 cells, were analyzed by HPLC to determine Sia composition. We found that the secreted proteins in mucus from NHBE cells and A549 cells conditioned media contained primarily unmodified Neu5Ac with ~1-2% of 9-O-Ac and no detectable levels of 7,9-O-Ac (Table 1) . This indicates that secreted mucus from these respiratory cells in culture are 210 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

To look more broadly at the possible range of modified Sia present in secreted mucus in different animals, we examined saliva from a number of influenza host species, including human, pig, horse, and dog (Fig. 4A,B) . While the proteins in saliva differ from those found in 215 respiratory mucus, they do contain some of the same heavily glycosylated proteins including mucins like MUC5B (49) (50) (51) . Human saliva was similar to the secreted mucus from NHBE and Erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) express high levels of sialylated surface molecules, primarily on glycophorins, and are used in IAV research to study the interactions of HA binding specificity, determining viral titer through the hemagglutination assay, and inhibition of hemagglutination by antibodies (HAI assay) (52, 53). It has long been known that IAV varies in 230 hemagglutination of RBCs from different species, at least in part due to differences in the Sia linkages present. The structures of HAs with Sia bound often suggest that modification of the C4, 5, 7, and/or 9 positions would influence IAV interactions with Sia. We found that chicken and guinea pig RBCs, which are often used to titer IAV virus and as the standard substrate for HAI assays, contained almost exclusively unmodified Neu5Ac, as did those from humans and 235 dogs (Fig. 4C,D) . In contrast, pig, horse, cow, and sheep RBCs contain high proportions of All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/800300 doi: bioRxiv preprint Neu5Gc, along with varying amounts of O-acetyl modifications. The high levels of Neu5Gc Sia present on the RBCs of these species had been previously reported, although not directly quantified as presented here (24, 54 ). The mouse erythrocytes tested here (from C57BL/6 mice) had the greatest diversity of modifications, with little Neu5Gc, around 50% Neu5Ac, and ~50% 240 of the Sia modified by 7, 8 and/or 9-O-acetylation, as previously reported (55) . 
These NA VLPs were first tested for enzymatic activity using a standard NA cleavage assay using methylumbelliferyl N-acetylneuraminide (MuNANA) as the substrate (Fig. 5C) (42) . The NA-expressing VLPs were incubated with BSM or with RBCs, and the released Sia were collected and analyzed by HPLC. For BSM, HPLC profiles of total Sia were created to compare NA cleavage preferences (Fig. 6A) . These profiles showed the Sia forms that were susceptible 255 to NA cleavage and release while the non-released forms were considered to be resistant to NA. These HPLC profiles were then compared to the total Sia released chemically by acid hydrolysis, an unbiased method that removes all Sia forms present in the original sample (45) .
All of the viral NA and the bacterial NeuA showed the highest level of cleavage for unmodified Neu5Ac compared to any of the modified forms, as more Neu5Ac was present in the released 260 profiles compared to chemical release. There was substantial variation in the cleavage activity against the modified Sia by the different viral NAs. N1 and N7 showed the lowest activities All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. To further test the ability of these NA VLPs to cleave Neu5Gc compared to Neu5Ac, the 270 amounts of Sia released from either horse RBCs (84% Neu5Gc) or chicken RBCs (99% Neu5Ac) were compared. All NAs showed significantly lower levels of Neu5Gc Sia released from horse RBCs compared to the amounts of Neu5Ac released from chicken RBCs (Fig. 6B) .
When compared directly, NA VLPs removed 5-12% of Neu5Gc compared to their activities on Neu5Ac (Fig. 6C) . Again, variability was seen between NA VLPs here, with N7 having the 275 lowest activity against Neu5Gc compared to Neu5Ac and N9 having the most. There was also variability in cleavage activity between NA from different strains as well, as seen in the variable amount of Neu5Ac removed by the NA VLPs in Figure 6B , but it is unclear whether this difference is due to the intrinsic activates of the NAs when expressed as VLPs or to innate differences in the specific activities of each NA enzyme, or both. It is clear, however, that O-280 acetyl and Neu5Gc modifications inhibit the activities of many different IAV NA and of NeuA, and that multiple modifications, such as di-O-acetyl modifications, or Neu5Gc that is also Oacetylated, were even more inhibitory, showing high resistance to most of the viral and bacterial NAs tested here.

Neu5Ac9NAc was used instead of 9-O-acetyl Neu5Ac 290 (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) due to the increased stability of the 9-N-Ac group (61, 62 Aichi/1968 H3 HA-Fcs had decreased binding to Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac9NAc (Fig. 7A) . The addition of the N-acetyl group at C9 blocked most binding, while Neu5Gc showed only a low level of binding. We saw the same binding dynamics for other H1 and H3 HA-Fc, but the SNA lectin, which recognizes α2-6-linked Sia, bound equally well to Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, but not to Neu5Ac9NAc (Fig. 7B) . This shows that the presence of O-(and in this case N-) acetyl 300 modifications can inhibit many Sia-binding proteins.

To specifically compare the effects of added Neu5Gc or Neu5Ac on the efficiency of 315 infection, the same three IAV strains were incubated with mouse serum from either wild-type mice (>80% Neu5Gc) or CMAH -/mice (100% Neu5Ac) prior to inoculation of cells (Fig. 8B) . In this case no specific trend was detected for the three viruses tested. Victoria H3N2 showed almost complete inhibition of infection by both sera, while PR8 H1N1 had a lower level of inhibition. Only pH1N1 showed a significant difference in response to the serums, with the WT 320 mouse serum having a much stronger inhibitory effect compared to the CMAH -/serum. This suggests that Neu5Gc vs. Neu5Ac inhibition may vary by virus strain, and that likely depends on some combination of HA binding specificity and NA activity.

The percentages of O-acetyl modified Sia in the tissues of mice varied widely, with high levels of 7,9-O-Ac 2 and 9-O-Ac being found on erythrocytes (~47%) and the colon (~19%). The levels in most other tissues varied between 2 and 9%, although these would likely be associated with higher levels on the smaller subsets of cells that were positive for staining with the probes. Neu5Gc was also present in many wild-type mouse 345 tissues with expression varying widely (between 10 and 80%). This is consistent with staining for Neu5Gc previously reported in some mouse tissues (44). 4-O-Ac Sia was found in small quantities in only a few tissues, with the highest being found in small intestine (~2%). This is consistent with previous findings of 4-O-Ac levels in mouse brain and liver quantified by GC/MS, although gut associated levels of 4-O-Ac were much higher in that study, possibly due to has not yet been identified, little is known about its synthesis, expression, or regulation (22, 23).

However, human saliva and secreted mucus from respiratory cells contained mostly unmodified Neu5Ac, suggesting different expression of modified Sia in the mucus of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues. This may be due to the particular functional characteristics of the microbiome in the GI tract compared to other mucosal sites, where 7,9-O-370 and 9-O-Ac on colonic mucus may decrease bacterial degradation of sialylated glycans, perhaps improving mucus integrity (69, 70) . Microbiome interactions may also explain the increased O-acetyl modifications found on both cow and mouse saliva. Cows are ruminants and as part of their digestion, regurgitate partially digested food from their microbe-rich rumen into their mouth to continue chewing as a cud to extract more nutrients. Somewhat similarly, mice 375 are coprophagic and consume feces, along with associated microbes, to re-digest again to improve absorption of nutrients. This would give both cows and mice the potential for more complex mucus and microbe interactions in both the oral cavity and the gut, thus having Oacetyl modifications on sialylated glycans on saliva mucus proteins could be advantageous by preventing degradation. However, further research is needed on the roles of these modifications 380 for the interactions between oral and colonic mucus with the microbiome.
host infection, and the specific linkages of Sia to the underlying glycan chain have long been known to influence host tropism (36) . We examined the effects of O-acetyl and Neu5Gc modifications on IAV HA binding, NA cleavage, and on infection, and found differences among 385 the IAV strains examined. All the different IAV NA tested showed preferential removal of Neu5Ac over any modified Sia form. Cleavage by N1, N7, and N9 were strongly inhibited by mono-acetylated Sia, while N2 and N3 were less affected. All NA had much lower activity against Neu5Gc, di-acetylated Sia, and particularly against Neu5Gc forms with additional Oacetylations. This confirms previous reports showing or suggesting inhibition of NA cleavage in 390 H1N1 and H3N2 strains (38, 42) , but revealing that there is wide variation of effects on different All rights reserved.

Acetylation and Neu5Gc modifications were also inhibitory for HA binding, with soluble HA-Fc sourced from different H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains showing significantly lower binding to these forms compared to unmodified Neu5Ac in an ELLA assay. (59, 71) , and is seen in the balance between the activities of the HA and NA for the α2-3 and α2-6-linked Sia (71, 72) . Incubation of virus with the wild-type mouse serum 405 (>80% Neu5Gc) compared to the serum of CMAH -/mice (100% Neu5Ac) also showed varying effects. Inhibition by WT serum was seen only for pH1N1 virus, while Victoria H3N2 and PR8 H1N1 were inhibited by both sera. This could confirm previous findings that the density of Sia on these serum proteins is the strongest inhibitory factor rather than the type of modified Sia present, as shown for incubation with horse serum (73). However, the variable results for 410 different viruses may indicate variation in sensitivity to Neu5Gc between strains that requires further investigation. It would also be worthwhile comparing inhibition of IAV strains adapted to different host species, particularly species with higher levels of modified Sia present in their respiratory tracts such as horses and pigs.
In summary we have shown that both the O-acetyl and Neu5Gc modifications present on 415 secreted glycoproteins in mucus and saliva, as well as on erythrocytes, vary greatly between different species.

To prevent the economic losses, it is pivotal 35 to detect the infection in latent stages rather than in later stages. We have developed an enhanced 36 method termed as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique to evaluate for the 37 latent detection of Xap in pomegranate using six set of specific primers. Three DNA intercalating 38 dyes were used, such as Ethidium bromide, hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) and SYBR Green which 39 resulted in visualising the positivity for LAMP assay. The reaction time and temperature were to 40 be 65°C from 30 min onwards, for the dyes and its sensitivity was observed up to 10 -7 ng in the 41 LAMP assay. For field applicability, LAMP assay detected Xap on 7 th day post infection while the 42 PCR amplified Xap after 11 th day post infection. Finally, the specificity of LAMP assay was 43 validated to be positive with ten Xap isolates for its accuracy and 29 non-Xap bacterial isolates 44 showed negative results. Moreover, this method could be used as a better alternative to PCR based 45 methods, for early detection of the pathogens. 46 47 50 Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is an important fruit crop widely cultivated from tropical to 51 temperate conditions [1]. India ranks first in the world for maximum area under pomegranate 52 cultivation (0.125 million hectares) and Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are the major 53 pomegranate growing states [2]. The bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. 54 punicae (Xap) in pomegranate was first reported in India in 1952 and presently it has a serious 55 outbreak in all major pomegranate-growing states resulting in a major economic loss. Prominent 56 small water-soaked and dark irregular spots appearing on the leaf are the typical symptoms induced 57 by this pathogen. The pathogen infect the fruit, stem, branches causing cracking symptoms and 58 ultimately leads to yield loss up to 80 percent [3]. .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/328674 doi: bioRxiv preprint 59 Globally, it is estimated that a minimum 30-40% of the crop cultivated gets destroyed 60 annually due to pests and diseases [4]. In India, bacterial blight alone reduces the yield between 61 60 to 80 percent above global yield loss in pomegranate. To avoid yield loss, it is very important 62 and necessary to develop an efficiently sensitive pathogen detection method within incubation time 63 of the pathogen (i.e. time between the host infection and expression of the disease symptoms) 64 [5,6]. 65 The most common methods employed for detecting the plant pathogens include 66 immunological techniques like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) [7] and molecular 67 methods such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) [8] and Southern blotting [9]. The methods for 68 early detection of the plant pathogens in the field has to be designed in such a way that it has to be 69 competently very sensitive, specific, cost-effective and detectable with a minimal equipment 70 facilities [10]. For instance, the PCR based technique has its own drawbacks which require high 71 quality and quantity of DNA and amplification is complex that requires a thermal cycler for 72 changing the reaction temperature and requires relatively long time for the amplification process 73 to complete. Further, it also requires agarose gel electrophoresis and gel documentation to confirm 74 the amplification [11]. To overcome these limitations, researchers have shown interest in 75 developing an isothermal amplification technique termed as Loop-mediated isothermal 76 amplification (LAMP) [12]. LAMP is an auto-cycling strand displacement DNA synthesis 77 technique, which is carried out at a constant temperature and does not require a thermal-cycler. 78 The amplification is completed within 30-60 minutes at a constant temperature of 60-65º C, which 79 can be carried out in a simple water bath or heating block [13]. Moreover, LAMP is a cost effective 80 and it does not require a thermal cycler and electrophoretic unit, as the result can be inferred as 81 positive or negative with the colour change or turbidity observed by naked eye without spending 82 much time [14]. 83 The favorable target for bacterial pathogen diagnostic includes mainly, 16S ribosomal 84 RNA (rRNA) gene which is been widely used to identify the bacterial species among different 85 bacteria [15-17]. This diversity is unique for species and their sequences are presented inside their 86 nine (V1 -V9) hypervariable regions which constitutes useful targets [18]. These regions are 87 highly conserved stretches in bacteria, which facilitates the identification through PCR In principle, the LAMP assay recognizes six specifically designed primers that recognize 90 eight distinct sequences from the target bacterial DNA [20]. It consists of two outer primers (F3 91 and B3), two inner primers (FIP and BIP), a loop-forward (LF) and a loop-backward (LB). These 92 six primers ensure a high specificity for target DNA amplification. Moreover, these primers enable 93 generation of a stem-loop DNA for subsequent complex LAMP amplification, which includes self-94 priming reaction. A mixture of DNA, differing in the number of loops and length of the stem-loop 95 is produced as a final product [21]. By considering the advantages of LAMP assay, which is widely 96 used to detect broad range of microorganisms[22,23]. The present study was aimed to detect the 97 bacterial blight of pomegranate in early stages with minimum pathogen DNA template by 98 optimizing several DNA intercalating dyes with lower temperature in a shorter time with less 99 technical skills.

The similar dilutions were also tested for its sensitivity using PCR based amplification of Xap 241 specific regions where the amplification was up to a template concentration of 10 -2 ng (Fig 5c) . 242 We observed that the EtBr had highest fluorescent among the dyes used for the assay (Fig 5d) .

In planta detection 282 This study aimed to detect Xap by LAMP assay at the early crop stage where the leaf was 283 mechanically pricked with bacterial blight pathogen to inoculate it to healthy pomegranate plants. 284 Three months old pomegranate plant (Bhagwa va.) was grown under controlled environment in a 285 glass house with 85% humidity. Xap1 bacterial culture was resuspended in sterile water and 286 inoculated on healthy plants using pin prick method. The prominent symptoms were observed from 287 the 11 th day after post inoculation, the oily lesions on the leaf surface were observed, which are 288 characteristic symptoms of the bacterial blight disease. The crude DNA isolation method was 289 followed to isolate DNA from the inoculated plants, every alternative day. After the pathogen 290 infectivity in the healthy plants, LAMP assay in agarose gel showed positive from 7 th day onwards 291 (Fig 7b) and for visualizing all the three dyes showed positive LAMP results from the 7 th day 292 onwards (Fig 7a) , in which the EtBr viewed to be most prominent comparing with other and its 293 absorbance intensity was increased with days (Fig 7d) . All the crude isolated DNA samples in 294 PCR method showed amplification from 11 th day onwards (Fig 7c) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Since HNB is added in the LAMP reaction prior to the 370 process, the colour gradually changes from violet to blue as the dNTP's decreases as 371 amplification takes place. So, using dyes like HNB prior to the preceding LAMP reaction tubes 372 can be ideal to prevent a chance of wrong detection [38] . 373 For field level application, remote laboratories may not be well equipped where LAMP 374 detection technique can be employed in diagnosis of pathogens. This assay can even detect Xap in 375 much earlier crop stage than the traditional PCR method. In our greenhouse study after Xap 376 inoculation the LAMP assay detected Xap on 7 th day while, PCR method detected from 10 th day 377 onwards. However, the prominent symptoms of Xap infection on the leaf in the glass house study 378 appeared only after 10 th day of inoculation (Fig 7) 379 Improvised field applications such as working with crude extracts from plants with 380 minimal requirement will enhance the importance of the assay for rapid and accurate detection of ",,biorxiv,10.1101/328674,,,biorxiv,2018-05-22,"Prasanna Kumar, M.

1aa3e788fc6b03c147e37200c3b011ca7a289a5c,"Recently emerged Wuhan's novel coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2, a causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading its pathogenicity throughout the world now. More than 4000 mortalities have occurred worldwide till the writing of this article and this number is increasing every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a global public health emergency. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with already published reports on SARS-CoV-2 indicated that it is closely related to Bat-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome like coronavirus (Bat CoV SARS-like) and wellstudied Human SARS. In this study, we have exploited the complementary approach to examine the intrinsically disordered regions in proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using Bat SARSlike and Human SARS CoVs as comparative models. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains a significant amount of ordered proteins except Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6. Further, cleavage sites in replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered. We have extensively investigated the dark proteome in SARS-CoV-2 which will have implications for the structured and unstructured biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.
Significance: The infection caused by Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemic that cause severe respiratory disease and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Currently, there is no such in-depth information on protein structure and function available in public domain and no effective anti-viral or vaccines are available for the treatment of this infection. Our study provides comparative order and disorder-based proteome information with Human SARS and Bat CoV that may be useful for structure-based drug discovery.","World health organization third of genome codes for replicase gene (~20kb) containing genes for all non-structural viral proteins while the rest ~10kb genome contains genes for accessory proteins interspersed between the genes responsible for coding structural proteins (Masters, 2006) . For the expression of structural and accessory proteins, additional transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) are present within the viral genome. 5' and 3' UTRs contain stem-loop regions required for viral RNA synthesis (Hussain et al, 2005) . The ~20kb (replicase gene) ssRNA is translated first into two long polyproteins: replicase polyprotein 1a and 1ab inside host cells. The newly formed polyproteins after cleavage by two viral proteases result in 16 non-structural proteins that perform a wide range of functions for viruses inside the host cell. They also induce ER-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) for viral replication and transcription. Structural proteins shape the outer cover of the virion, while accessory proteins are mostly involved in host immune evasion Sawicki et al, 2007) .
In this manuscript, we want to analyze the dark proteome of the SARS-CoV-2, so explaining a perspective on ordered and disordered proteome is essential. In classical structure-functionparadigm, a stable and defined 3-Dimensional structure is a prerequisite for a protein to accomplish its role. This notion dominated over the years before the idea of intrinsic disorder in protein structures came into full discussions and acceptance among the structural biologists. The other class of proteins fails to fold into well-defined structures and instead remain disordered under physiological buffer conditions. These proteins are called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Regions within proteins that contain unstructured segments are called intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). The property of being intrinsically disordered in proteins is determined by the amino acid sequences (Van Der Lee et al, 2014; Wright & Dyson, 1999) . IDPs exhibit their biological functions in signaling, gene regulation, and control processes by interacting with their physiological partners (Dunker et al, , 2002 (Dunker et al, , 2008 Liu et al, 2006; Uversky et al, 2005) . 
The Mean predicted percentage of intrinsic disorder (Mean PPID) scores, that were obtained by averaging the predicted disorder scores from six disorder predictors (Supplementary Table 1 -3) for each protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as Human SARS, and Bat CoV have been represented in table 1. * These sequences are based on genome annotations done by Wu et al. , (Wu et al, 2020a) .
and 2C are 2D-disorder plots of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV respectively and represent the PPID PONDR-FIT vs PPID Mean plot. Based on the predicted levels of intrinsic disorder, proteins can be classified as highly ordered (PPID < 10%), moderately disordered (10% ≤ PPID < 30%) and highly disordered (PPID ≥ 30%) (Rajagopalan et al, 2011) . From the data in table 1, figures 2A, 2B and 2C; as well as the PPID based classification, we conclude that the Nucleocapsid protein from all three strains of coronavirus possesses the highest percentage of the disorder. ORF3b protein in Bat Cov, ORF6 protein in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV and ORF9b protein in Human SARS and SARS CoV belong to the class of moderately disordered proteins. While the structured proteins, namely, Spike glycoprotein (S), Envelope protein (E) and Membrane protein (M) as well as accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8 (ORF8a and ORF8b in case of Human SARS) of all three strains of coronavirus are ordered. ORF14 and ORF10 proteins also belong to the class of ordered proteins. In CH-CDF plot of the proteins of (D) SARS-CoV-2 (E) Human SARS and (F) Bat CoV, the Y coordinate of each protein spot signifies distance of corresponding protein from the boundary in CH plot and the X coordinate value corresponds to the average distance of the CDF curve for the respective protein from the CDF boundary.
In order to further investigate the nature of the disorder in proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV; the results obtained from two binary classifiers of disorder; Charge hydropathy (CH) plot and Cumulative distribution function (CDF) plot were combined. This helped evaluate the disorder predisposition of the proteins based on their charge, hydropathy and PONDR ® VLXT disorder scores. The CH plot is a linear classifier that differentiates between proteins that are predisposed to possess extended disordered regions and include random coils and pre-molten globules from proteins that have compact conformations (ordered proteins and molten globule like proteins). The other binary predictor, CDF is a nonlinear classifier as it uses PONDR ® VLXT scores to discriminate ordered globular proteins from all disordered conformations, which include, native molten globules, premolten globules, and random coils. The CH-CDF plot can be divided into four quadrants: Q1, which is expected to include ordered proteins; Q2, which will include proteins predicted to be disordered by CDF and ordered by CH; Q3, which represents proteins that are predicted to be disordered by both CH and CDF analysis and Q4, which includes proteins disordered according to CH but ordered according to CDF analysis . Figures 2D,  2E and 2F represent the CH-CDF analysis of proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV and it can be observed that all the proteins are located within the two quadrants Q1 and Q2. The CH-CDF analysis leads to the conclusion that all proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are ordered except Nucleocapsid protein, which is predicted to be disordered by CDF but ordered by CH and hence lies in Q2. . The mean disorder propensity which has been calculated by averaging the disorder scores from all six predictors is represented by short-dot line (sky-blue line) in the graph. The light sky-blue shadow region signifies the mean error distribution. The residues missing in the PDB structure or the residues for which PDB structure is unavailable is represented by the grey-coloured area in the graph. (D) A 3.60Å resolution PDB structure of spike glycoprotein of Human SARS obtained by cryo-EM (PDB ID: 6ACC) of 18-239, 244-660, 674-811, 832-1119 residues. It consists of 3 chains, A (violet-red), B (dark khaki) and C (turquoise), which represent the subunits S1, S2 and S2' respectively.
MSA analysis among all three coronaviruses demonstrates that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a 77.71% sequence identity with Bat CoV and 77.14% identity with Human SARS (Supplementary Figure S1A) . All three S proteins are found to have a conserved C-terminal region. However, the N-terminal regions of S proteins display noteworthy differences. Given that there is significant sequence variation at S RBD in N-terminus, this might be the reason behind variation in its virulence and its receptor-mediated binding and entry into the host cell. According to our analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity, S protein of all three studied coronaviruses are highly structured as their predicted disorder propensity lies below 10% ( Table 1) . The mean PPID score of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV is calculated to be 1.41%, 1.12%, and 1.85% respectively. Graphs in figures 3A, 3B and 3C represent the intrinsic disorder propensity of each residue in S protein of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV obtained from six disorder predictors.
Envelope (E) glycoprotein: E Glycoprotein is a multifunctional inner membrane protein that plays an important role in the assembly and morphogenesis of virions in the cell (Ruch & Machamer, 2012; Ujike & Taguchi, 2015 ) (DeDiego et al, 2007 . E protein consists of two ectodomains associated with N and C-terminal regions, and a transmembrane domain. It homo-oligomerize to form pentameric membrane destabilizing transmembrane (TM) hairpins to form a pore necessary for its ion channel activity . Figure 4D shows the NMR-structure (PDB ID: 2MM4) of Human SARS envelope glycoprotein of 8-65 residues (Li et al, 2014) . MSA results illustrate ( Figure 4E ) that this protein is highly conserved, with only three amino acid substitutions in E protein of SARS-CoV-2 conferring its 96% sequence similarity with Human SARS and Bat CoV. Bat CoV shares 100% sequence identity with Human SARS. Mean PPID calculated for SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV E proteins are 5.33%, 6.58%, and 6.58% respectively ( Table 1) . The E protein is found to have a reasonably well-predicted structure. Our predictions suggest that residues of N-and C-terminals are displaying a higher tendency for the disorder. The last 18 hydrophilic residues (59-76) have been reported to adopt a random-coil conformation with and without the addition of lipid membranes (Surya et al, 2013) . Literature suggests that the last four amino acids of the Cterminal region of E protein containing a PZD-binding motif are involved in protein-protein interactions with a tight junction protein PALS1. PALS1 is involved in maintaining the polarity of epithelial cells in mammals (Teoh et al, 2010) . We speculate that the disordered region content may be facilitating the interactions with other proteins as well. Respective graphs in figure 4A , 4B, and 4C indicates the predicted intrinsic disorder in E proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV.
M Glycoprotein plays an important role in virion assembly by interacting with the N, and E proteins (Tseng et al, 2013 (Tseng et al, , 2010 Corse & Machamer, 2003) . Protein M interacts specifically with a short viral packaging signal containing coronavirus RNA in the absence of N protein highlights an important nucleocapsid-independent viral RNA packaging mechanism inside host cells (Narayanan et al, 2003) . It gains high-mannose N-glycans in ER which is modified into complex N-glycans in the Golgi complex. Glycosylation of M protein is observed to be not essential for virion fusion in cell culture (Nal et al, 2005; Voss et al, 2009 ). Cryo-EM and Tomography data indicate that M forms two distinct conformations: Compact M protein having high flexibility and low spike density; Elongated M protein having a rigid structure and narrow range of membrane curvature (Neuman et al, 2011) . Regions of M glycoproteins are important as a dominant immunogen. This is reported as a deduced X-ray diffraction-based crystal structure (PDB ID: 3I6G) of HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, A-2 alpha chain, and Beta-2-microglobulin with small peptide of membrane glycoprotein (88-96 residues) complex in figure 5D . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . antigen, A-2 alpha chain and Beta-2-microglobulin with immunogen peptide of membrane glycoprotein (9 amino acids) of Human SARS generated, by X-ray diffraction (PDB ID: 3I6G). Membrane glycoprotein consists of two chains, C and F chain (conifer blue colour) of 88-96 residues and other entities are represented in tan colour.

M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a sequence similarity of 90.05% with Bat CoV and 89.59% with Human SARS M proteins ( Figure 5E ). Our analysis revealed the intrinsic disorder in M proteins of SARS-COV-2 Human SARS, and Bat CoV as estimated mean PPID is 2.70%, 1.36%, and 1.36% respectively. This is in line with the previous publication by Goh et al. on Human SARS HKU4 where they found the mean PPID of 4% using additional predictors such as TopIDP and FoldIndex along with the predictors used in our study (Goh et al, 2013) . Figures 5A, 5B and 5C show the graphs for the predisposition of intrinsic disorder in residues of M proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV.
N protein is one of the major proteins playing a significant role in transcription, and virion assembly of coronaviruses (McBride et al, 2014) . It binds to viral genomic RNA forming a ribonucleoprotein core required for encapsidation of RNA during viral particle assembly (Saikatendu et al, 2007) . SARS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) formation has been reported to depend upon either M and E proteins or M and N proteins. For effective production and release of VLPs, co-expression of E and N proteins has been found to be necessary with M protein (Siu et al, 2008) . N protein of Human SARS consists of two structural domains: The N-terminal domain (NTD: 45-181 residues) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD: 248-365 residues) with a disordered patch in between the domains. N protein has been demonstrated to bind viral RNA using both NTD and CTD (Chang et al, 2009) . Figure 6D1 displays the resolved crystal structure (PDB ID: 1SSK) of Human SARS nucleocapsid protein (45-181 residues) . Figure 6D2 shows another X-ray diffraction generated crystal structure (PDB ID: 2GIB) of Human SARS nucleocapsid protein (270-366 residues) (Yu et al, 2006) . Figure S1B ). Our analysis revealed the respective mean PPID of 60.38%, 71.09%, and 65.80% for SARS-COV-2 Human SARS, and Bat CoV N proteins. In accordance with the previously calculated intrinsic disorder (Goh et al, 2013) , N protein is highly disordered in all three SARS viruses ( Table 1) . Graphs in figure 6A , 6B, and 6C depicts the disorder in SARS-CoV-2 Human SARS, and Bat CoV nucleocapsid residues. that N and C-terminals are completely disordered with the central unstructured segment. As expected, N protein of novel coronavirus has similar residues showing the tendency for the disorder which is reported in Human SARS N protein prior to this study (Goh et al, 2013) . The N and C-terminals are completely disordered with the central unstructured segment. In novel N protein, following residues 1-57, 64-102, 145-162, 166-289 and 362-422 are found to be disordered. The residues are lying within the NTD and CTD region which due to their structural plasticity were not crystallized in Human SARS N protein. SARS-CoV-2 has a disordered segment from 168-289 residues while Human SARS has predicted to have an unstructured segment from 145-289 residues. Overall, all three N proteins are found to be highly disordered proteins.
Literature suggests that some proteins are translated from the genes interspersed in between the genes of structural proteins. These proteins are termed as accessory proteins, and many of them are proposed to work in viral pathogenesis (Narayanan et al, 2008) .
ORF3a and ORF3b: ORF3a is, of molecular weight ~31 kDa, a multifunctional protein that has been found localized in different organelles inside host cells. Also referred to as U274, X1, and ORF3, the gene for this protein is present between S and E genes of the SARS-CoV genome Yuan et al, 2005a; Tan et al, 2004) . The homo-tetramer complex of ORF3a has been demonstrated to form a potassium-ion channel on the host cell plasma membrane (Lu et al, 2006) . It performs a major function during virion assembly by colocalizing with E, M, and S viral proteins (Tan, 2005; McBride & Fielding, 2012) . ORF3b protein localizes in the cytoplasm, nucleolus, and outer membrane of mitochondria (Yuan et al, 2006 (Yuan et al, , 2005c . In Huh 7 cells, its over-expression has been linked with the activation of AP-1 via ERK and JNK pathways (Varshney & Lal, 2011) . Transfection of ORF3b-EGFP leads to cell growth arrest in the G0/G1 phase of Vero, 293 and COS-7 cells (Yuan et al, 2005b) . ORF3a induces apoptosis via caspase 8/9 directed mitochondrial-mediated pathways while ORF3b is reported to affect only caspase 3 pathways (Khan et al, 2006; Law et al, 2005b) . On performing MSA, shown in figure 7D, we found that ORF 3a protein of SARS-COV-2 is found to be closer to ORF3a of Bat CoV (73.36%) than ORF3a of Human SARS (72.99%). Figures 7A, 7B and 7C depict the propensity of disorder in ORF 3a proteins of novel SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV (SARS-like). Mean PPIDs in ORF 3a proteins are: SARS-CoV-2 -9.09%, Human SARS -8.76%, and Bat CoV (SARS-like) -6.20%. According to the analysis of intrinsic disorder, the mean PPID in ORF3b proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are 0%, 7.14%, and 23.08% respectively, as represented in figures 8A, 8B, and 8C. MSA results demonstrate that ( Figure 8D ), ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 is not closer to ORF3b protein of Human SARS and to ORF3b protein of Bat-CoV, having a sequence similarity of only 54.55% and 59.09% respectively.
ORF6: ORF6 is a very short SARS coronavirus protein having ~63 residues. Also known as P6, is a membrane-associated protein that serves as an interferon (IFN) antagonist . It downregulates the IFN pathway by blocking a nuclear import protein, karyopherin α2. Using its C-terminal residues, ORF6 disrupts karyopherin import complex in the cytosol and, therefore, hampers the movement of transcription factors like STAT1 into the nucleus Frieman et al, 2007) . It contains a YSEL motif near its C-terminal region, which functions in protein internalization from the plasma membrane into the endosomal vesicles (Netland et al, 2007) . Another study has also demonstrated the presence of ORF6 in endosomal/lysosomal compartments (Netland et al, 2007; Gunalan et al, 2011) . author/funder. All rights reserved.

MSA results demonstrate that ( Figure 9D ), SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is closer to ORF6 protein of Human SARS, having a sequence similarity of 68.85% than ORF6 of Bat CoV (SARS-like) (67.21%). Novel SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is calculated to be the second most disordered structural protein with a PPID of 22.95%, especially, at the C-terminal region.
Our analysis of intrinsic disorder using six predictors have revealed the mean PPID in ORF6 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are analyzed to be 22.95%, 20.63%, and 20.63% respectively ( Table 1) . Graphs in figures 9A, 9B and 9C illustrate the disorder for each residue in ORF6 proteins of all three studied coronaviruses. Moderately disordered protein ORF6 is predicted to have an intrinsic disorder near its C-terminal region ( Figures  9A, B, C) . These regions are significant for the biological activities of ORF6. As mentioned above, this hydrophilic region contains lysosomal targeting motif (YSEL) and diacidic motif (DDEE) responsible binding and recognition during translocation (Netland et al, 2007) . However, the N-terminal region is not showing any disordered prediction. The literature on Human SARS suggests that the 1-38 amino acid N-terminal region is alpha-helical and embedded in the membrane but not a transmembrane protein (Zhou et al, 2010) .
ORF7a and ORF7b: Alternatively called U122, ORF7a is a type I transmembrane protein Huang et al, 2006) . It has been proven to localize in ER, Golgi, and peri-nuclear space. The presence of a KRKTE motif near the C-terminal imports the protein from the ER to the Golgi apparatus Huang et al, 2006) . It contributes to viral pathogenesis by activating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines like IL-8 and RANTES (Kanzawa et al, 2006; Law et al, 2005a) .

Figure 10D represents the 1.8Å X-ray diffraction-based crystal structure (PDB ID: 1XAK) of ORF7a on Human SARS revealed its compact seven-stranded topology similar to Ig-superfamily members (Nelson et al, 2005) . Its structure includes a signal peptide, a luminal domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail at 5' end (Nelson et al, 2005; McBride & Fielding, 2012) . We found that 121 residues long ORF7a protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares 89.26% and 85.95% sequence identity with ORF7a proteins of Bat CoV, and Human SARS ( Figure 10E ). ORF7b protein of SARS-CoV-2 is found to be closer with Human SARS (81.40%) than Bat sequence with 79.07% sequence identity figure 11D. As can be observed from table 1, our disorder prediction resulted in the overall PPID for ORF7a proteins are 1.65% for SARS-CoV-2, 0.82% for Bat CoV and 0.82% for Human SARS. Mean PPIDs estimated for ORF7b proteins are: 9.30% of novel CoV, 4.55% for Bat CoV and 4.55% Human SARS. Graphs in figures 10A, 10B, and 10C represent the predisposed residues for disorder in ORF7a proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV respectively. Graphs in figures 11A, 11B, and 11C, depict the predisposed residues for disorder in ORF7b proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV respectively. According to our analysis, both proteins in all three studied coronaviruses have a significantly ordered structure.
ORF7b is an integral membrane protein that has been shown to localize in the Golgi complex (Schaecher et al, 2007; Kopecky-Bromberg et al, 2006) . The same reports also confirm the role of ORF7b as an accessory as well as a structural protein for SARS-CoV virion.
In animals and in isolates from early human infections, the ORF8 gene codes for a single ORF8 protein. However, it was observed that in late infections, at middle and late stages, a 29 nucleotide deletion led to the formation of two distinct proteins; ORF8a and ORF8b having 39 and 84 residues respectively (Oostra et al, 2007a; Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004) . Both proteins have a distinct conformation than the longer ORF8 protein. It has been reported that overexpression of ORF8b resulted in the downregulation of E protein while the proteins ORF8a and ORF8/ORF8ab have no effect on the expression of protein E. Also, ORF8/ORF8ab was found to interact very strongly with proteins S, ORF3a and ORF7a. ORF8a interacts with S and E proteins, whereas ORF8b protein interacts with E, M, ORF3a and ORF7a proteins (Keng et al, 2006) . author/funder. All rights reserved.

Our IDP analysis revealed no disorder in both ORF8 proteins (of SARS-CoV-2, Bat CoV) as can be observed from the graphs in figures 12A and 12B. Both proteins are analyzed to be completely structured having a mean PPID of 0.00%. In ORF8a and ORF8b proteins of the Human SARS, the predicted disorder is estimated to be 2.56%, and 2.38% respectively (Table 1) . Graphs in (Figures 13A and 13B) illustrate a little disorder near the end terminals of ORF8a and ORF8b proteins.
ORF9b: This protein is expressed from an alternative ORF within the N gene through a leaky ribosome binding process (Xu et al, 2009) . Inside host cells, ORF9b enters the nucleus which is a cell cycle independent process and passive entry. This has been shown to interact with a nuclear export protein receptor Exportin 1 (Crm1) using which it translocate out of the nucleus (Sharma et al, 2011) . A 2.8Å resolved crystal structure (PDB ID: 2CME) of ORF9b protein of Human SARS exposed the presence of a dimeric tent-like structure along with central hydrophobic amino acids ( Figure 14D) . The published structure has highly polarized distribution of charges with positively charged residues on one side and negatively charged on the other (Meier et al, 2006) . author/funder.

Based on the sequence availability of Accession ID NC_045512.2, the translated protein sequence of ORF9b is not reported for novel SARS-CoV-2 yet. However, based on the report by Wu and colleagues, they have already annotated the sequences of SARS-CoV-2, so we have taken the sequences and analyzed the intrinsic disorder in our manuscript. According to the MSA represented in figure 14E , ORF9b protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares 73.20% similarity with Human SARS and 74.23% similarity with Bat CoV.
Our IDP analysis (Table 1) shows that ORF9b of Human SARS is a moderately unstructured protein with a mean PPID estimated to 26.53%. As depicted in the graphs of figure 14A , 14B, and 14C disorder mainly lies near N-terminal end 1-10 residues and 28-40 residues near the central region with a well-ordered inner core of Human SARS ORF9b protein. X-ray diffraction-based crystal structure of ORF9b has a missing electron density of the first 8 residues and 26-37 residues near the central region. This might be because disordered regions are difficult to crystallize due to their highly dynamic structural conformations. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein with a mean PPID of 10.31% has a N-terminal (1-10 residues) predicted disordered segment. ORF9b of Bat coronavirus is analyzed to have an intrinsic disorder of 9.28%, comparatively lesser than Human SARS ORF9b protein.
The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 has ORF10 protein of 38 amino acids. ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2 has a 100% sequence similarity with Bat CoV strain Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (Wu et al, 2020b) . However, we have not done the IDPs analysis for ORF10 from the Bat-SL-CoVZC45 strain since we have taken different strain of Bat CoV (reviewed strain HKU3-1) in our study. Thus, we have done the IDP analysis for ORF10 protein of SARS-CoV-2 only, according to which, mean PPID is calculated to be 0.00%. Figure 15 shows the graph of the predisposition of intrinsic disorder in residues of ORF10 protein. ORF14: This is a 70 amino acids long uncharacterized protein of unknown function is present in Human SARS and Bat CoV. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF14 is of 73 amino acid long protein. According to the MSA, ORF14 of SARS-CoV-2 have 77.14% similarity with Human-SARS and 72.86% similarity with Bat CoV as represented in figure 16D . We have performed the IDP analysis to understand the presence of disorder in this protein. The graph in figure 16A, 16B and 16C illustrates the intrinsic disorder in residues of ORF14 of SARS-CoV-2, Human-SARS, and Bat CoV; having calculated mean PPID is to be 0.00%, 2.86%, and 0.00% respectively. 
In coronaviruses, due to ribosomal leakage during translation two-third of the RNA genome is processed into two polyproteins: (i) Replicase polyprotein 1a and (ii) Replicase polyprotein 1ab. Both contain non-structural proteins (Nsp1-10) in addition to different proteins required for viral replication and pathogenesis. Replicase polyprotein 1a contains an additional Nsp11 protein of 13 amino acids function of which is not investigated yet. The longer replicase polyprotein 1ab of 7073 amino acids accommodates five other non-structural proteins (Nsp12-16) (Thiel et al, 2003) . These proteins assist in ER membrane-induced vesicle formation, which acts as sites for replication and transcription. In addition to this, nonstructural proteins work as proteases, helicases, and mRNA capping and methylation author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . Table 2 represents the PPID mean scores of the 15 non-structural proteins of Replicase polyprotein 1ab in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV that were obtained by combining the results from six disorder predictors (Supplementary Table 4-6) . Figures  17A, 17B and 17C show the 2D-disorder plots of the Nsps coded by ORF1ab in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV respectively. Based on the PPID Mean scores in table 2, figures 17A, 17B, 17C and PPID based classification (Rajagopalan et al, 2011) , we conclude that none of the Nsps in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV are highly disordered. The highest disorder was observed in Nsp8 of all three Coronaviruses. Both Nsp1 and Nsp8 are moderately disordered proteins (10% ≤ PPID ≤ 30%). We also observed that Nsp2, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp15 and Nsp16 have disorder less than 10% and hence, belong to the category of highly ordered proteins. The other non-structural proteins, namely, Nsp4, Nsp12, Nsp13 and Nsp14 have negligible levels of disorder (PPID < 1%) which tells us that these are highly structured proteins.
Bat CoV, the Y coordinate of each protein spot signifies distance of corresponding protein from the boundary in CH plot and the X coordinate value corresponds to the average distance of the CDF curve for the respective protein from the CDF boundary.
The CH-CDF analysis of the Nsps from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV have been represented in figures 17D, 17E and 17F respectively. It was observed that all the nsps of the three coronaviruses occur in quadrant Q1, which helps conclude that all the nsps are predicted to be ordered according to the binary predictors, CH and CDF. author/funder.

Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp3 are cleaved using a viral papain-like proteinase (Nsp3/PL-Pro) while the rest are cleaved by another viral 3C-like proteinase (Nsp5/3CL-Pro). Based on the cleavage of replicase 1ab polyprotein of Human SARS by two proteases, we have shown disorder propensity at the cleavage sites with few residues spanning the terminals (Figure 18) . Interestingly, we observed that all the cleavage sites are largely disordered, suggesting that intrinsic disorder may have a role in maturation of individual non-structural proteins. As the percentage identities of Nsps of Human SARS are closer with Nsps of SARS-CoV-2, we speculate the of presence of intrinsic disorder at the cleavage sites in polyproteins of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, their structural and functional properties are thoroughly described below with the predicted intrinsic disorder regions. 
This works as a host translation inhibitor as it binds to the 40S subunit of the ribosome and blocks the translation of cap-dependent mRNAs as well as mRNAs that uses internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (Lokugamage et al, 2012) .

Its N-terminal region is found to be quite conserved than the rest of the protein sequence ( Figure 19E ). Mean PPIDs of nsp1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are 12.78%, 14.44%, and 12.85%, respectively. Figure 19A , 19B, and 19C) illustrate the graphs of predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in residues of Nsp1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. According to the analysis, the following residues are predicted to have disorderedness, SARS-CoV-2 (1-7, 165-180), Human SARS (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (165) (166) (167) (168) (169) (170) (171) (172) (173) (174) (175) (176) (177) (178) (179) (180) (165) (166) (167) (168) (169) (170) (171) (172) (173) (174) (175) (176) (177) (178) (179) . NMR-based structure of Nsp1 of Human SARS revealed the presence of two unstructured segments near the N-terminal (1-12 residues) and C-terminal (129-179 residues) regions (Almeida et al, 2007) . The disordered region (128-180 residues) at C-terminus are characterized to be important for Nsp1 expression (Jauregui et al, 2013) . Based on sequence homology with Human SARS Nsp1 protein, the predicted disordered Nsp1 C-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 may play a critical role in its expression.
This protein functions by disrupting the host survival pathway by interacting with host proteins Prohibitin1 and Prohibitin 2 (Cornillez-Ty et al, 2009) .

Nsp3 is a viral papain-like protease that affects the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 and therefore antagonizes the IFN pathway. In another biochemical study, it was demonstrated that Nsp3 works by stabilizing NFinhibitor further blocking the NF-pathway (Frieman et al, 2009) . Figure 21D depicts the 1.85Å X-ray diffraction-based crystal structure (PDB ID: 2FE8) of the catalytic core of Nsp3 protein of Human SARS is obtained by Andrew and colleagues. This structure is consisting of 723-1036 residues.

According to our results, the mean PPIDs of Nsp3 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are 7.40%, 7.91%, and 7.78% respectively ( Table 2) .

Predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in residues of Nsp4 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are depicted in graphs figure 22A, 22B, and 22C. With PPIDs around zero, Nsp4 proteins were analyzed to be highly structured. According to the analysis, disorderedness is not found in the Nsp4 protein.
Also referred to as 3CL-pro, Nsp5 works as a protease and cleaves replicase polyprotein (1a and 1ab) at 11 major sites (Tomar et al, 2015; Sparks et al, 2008) . Crystal structure (PDB ID: 5C5O) obtained by X-ray diffraction from 3241-3546 residues is shown in figure 23D . In this complex, 3CL-protease is bind to a phenyl-betaalanyl (S, R)-N-declin type inhibitor. Another crystal structure resolved to 1.96Å revealed a chymotrypsin-like fold and a conserved substrate-binding site connected to a novel α-helical fold (Anand et al, 2002) . Recently, the structure of Nsp5 of SARS-CoV-2 has been crystallized using an X-ray diffraction-based technique (PDB ID: 6LU7) ( Figure 23E ). author/funder. All rights reserved.

Non-structural protein 6 (Nsp6): Nsp6 protein is involved in blocking ER-induced autophagosome/autolysosome vesicle that functions in restricting viral production inside host cells. It induces autophagy by activating the omegasome pathway which is normally implied by cells in response to starvation. SARS Nsp6 leads to the generation of small autophagosome vesicles thereby limiting their expansion (Cottam et al, 2014) . author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

According to our results, mean PPIDs in Nsp6 proteins are calculated to be 1.03% -SARS-CoV-2, 1.03% -Human SARS, and 4.48% -Bat CoV. Figure 24A , 24B, and 24C show the respective graphs of intrinsic disorder tendency in Nsp6 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. From our predicted IDP results, we found no disorder in all three Nsp6 proteins. According to the analysis, disorderedness is not found in the Nsp4 protein.
The ~10kDa Nsp7 protein helps in primaseindependent de novo initiation of viral RNA replication by forming a hexadecameric ring-like structure with Nsp8 protein (te Zhai et al, 2005) . Both non-structural proteins (7 and 8) contribute 8 molecules to the ring structured multimeric viral RNA polymerase. Site-directed mutagenesis in Nsp8 protein revealed a D/ExD/E motif essential for in-vitro catalysis (te . Figure 25D depicts the 3.1Å resolution electron microscopy-based structure (PDB ID: 6NUR) of RDRP-nsp8-nsp7 complex bound to Nsp12 protein.

Both SARS-CoV-2 and Human SARS Nsp8 proteins were calculated to have a mean PPID of 23.74% and, for Nsp8 of Bat CoV mean disorder is predicted to be 22.22%. Figure  25A , 25B, and 25C display the graphs of predicted intrinsic disorder tendency in Nsp7 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. Graphs in figure 26A , 26B, and 26C represent the predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in Nsp8 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. As our analysis suggests, Nsp7 proteins have a well-predicted structure while Nsp8 proteins have a moderate amount of disorderness. Nsp8 proteins is predicted to have a long disorder segment from 44-84 residues in both SARS-CoV-2 and Human SARS and 48-84 residues in Bat CoV.
Nsp9 protein is a single-stranded RNA-binding protein (Egloff et al, 2004) . It might provide protection from nucleases by binding and stabilizing viral nucleic acids during replication or transcription (Egloff et al, 2004) . Presumed to evolve from a protease, Nsp9 forms a dimer using its GXXXG motif (Ponnusamy et al, 2008; Miknis et al, 2009) . Figure 27D shows a 2.7Å crystal structure (PDB ID: 1QZ8) of Human SARS Nsp9 that identified an oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide fold-like fold in its structure (Egloff et al, 2004) . Each monomer contains a cone-shaped β-barrel and a C-terminal α-helix arranged into a compact domain (Egloff et al, 2004) . author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.
The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 Nsp9 of SARS-CoV-2 is equally identical to nsp9 proteins of both Human SARS and Bat CoV having a percentage identity of 97.35%. The difference in three amino acids at 34, 35 and 48 positions accounts for the above similarity score ( Figure 27E ). As calculated, the mean PPIDs of Nsp9 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are 7.08%, 7.96%, and 7.08% respectively. Graphs in figures 27A, 27B, and 27C depict the predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in the Nsp9 protein of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. According to our analysis of intrinsic disorder, all three Nsp9 proteins are completely structured.
Non-structural protein 10 (Nsp10): Nsp10 performs several functions for SARS-CoV. It forms a complex with Nsp14 for hydrolyzes of dsRNA in 3′ to 5′ direction and activates in its exonuclease activity (Bouvet et al, 2012) . It also stimulates the MTase activity of Nsp14 protein required during RNA-cap formation after replication (Bouvet et al, 2010) . Figure  28D represents the structure (PDB ID: 5C8T) of the Nsp10/Nsp14 complex. In consistence with the previous biochemical experimental results, the structure identified important interactions with the ExoN (exonuclease domain) of Nsp14 without affecting its N7-Mtase activity (Bouvet et al, 2012 (Bouvet et al, , 2010 . author/funder.

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10 protein is quite conserved having a 97.12% sequence identity with Nsp10 of Human SARS and 97.84% with Nsp10 of Bat CoV ( Figure 28E) . Mean PPIDs of all three studied Nsp10 proteins is found to be 5.04%. Figures 28A, 28B, and 28C show the graphs of predicted intrinsic disorder tendency in Nsp10 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV respectively. Our results of the predicted intrinsic disorder suggest the absence of disorder among studied Nsp10 proteins.
Nsp12 is an RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RDRP) of coronaviruses. It carries out both primer-independent and primer-dependent synthesis of viral RNA with Mn 2+ as its metallic co-factor and viral Nsp7 and 8 as protein co-factors (Ahn et al, 2012) . As mentioned above, a 3.1Å resolution crystal structure (PDB ID: 6NUR) of Human SARS Nsp12 in association with Nsp7 and Nsp8 proteins has been reported using electron microscopy ( Figure 25D ). Nsp12 has a polymerase domain similar to ""right hand"", finger domain (398-581, 628-687 residues), palm domain (582-627, 688-815 residues) and a thumb domain (816-919) (Kirchdoerfer & Ward, 2019) . author/funder.

It is found to share 96.35% sequence identity with Human SARS Nsp12 protein and 95.60% with Bat CoV Nsp12. Mean PPID in all three Nsp12 proteins is estimated to be 0.43% (Table 2) . Graphs in figure 29A , 29B, and 29C illustrate the respective predicted intrinsic disorder in Nsp12 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. As expected, no significant disorder was predicted in Nsp12 proteins.
Nsp13 functions as a viral helicase and unwinds dsDNA/dsRNA in 5' to 3' polarity (Adedeji et al, 2012) . Recombinant Helicase expressed in E.coli Rosetta 2 strain has been reported to unwind ~280 bp per second (Adedeji et al, 2012) . Figure 30D represents a 2.8Å X-ray diffraction-based crystal structure (PDB ID: 6JYT) of Human SARS Nsp13 protein. Helicase contains a 19-20 loop on 1A domain which is primarily responsible for its unwinding activity. Moreover, the study revealed an important interaction of Nsp12 protein with Nsp13 that further enhances its helicase activity (Jia et al, 2019) . author/funder. All rights reserved.

In accordance with our results, the mean PPIDs of all three Nsp13 proteins are estimated to be 0.67%. Figure 30A , 30B, and 30C show the respective graphs for the predisposition of intrinsic disorder in Nsp13 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. Figure 30D shows PDB structure of helicase/Nsp13 (PDB ID: 6JYT), from 5302-5902 residues (sienna colour). No significant disorder is revealed in all three Nsp13 proteins.
Multifunctional nsp14 acts as an Exoribonuclease (ExoN) and methyltransferase (N7-Mtase) for SARS-Coronaviruses. It's 3' to 5' exonuclease activity lies in conserved DEDD residues related to exonuclease superfamily (Minskaia et al, 2006) . Its guanine-N7 methyltransferase activity depends upon the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as a cofactor (Bouvet et al, 2010) . As mentioned previously, nsp14 requires nsp10 protein in for activating its ExoN and N7-Mtase activity inside host cells. Figure 28D depicts the 3.2Å deduced crystal structure (PDB ID: 5C8T) of human SARS nsp10/nsp14 complex using the X-ray diffraction technique. Amino acids 1-287 form the ExoN domain and 288-527 residues from the N7-Mtase domain of nsp14. A loop present from 288-301 residues is essential for its N7-Mtase activity (Ma et al, 2015) . author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Mean PPID of nsp14 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and Human SARS is calculated to be 0.38% while nsp14 of Bat CoV has a mean PPID 0.57%. Predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in residues of nsp14 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are represented in graphs in figure  31A , 10B, and 31C. As can be observed from PPID values, all nsp14 proteins are found to be highly structured.
Nsp15 is a uridylate-specific RNA Endonuclease (NendoU) that creates a 2′-3′ cyclic phosphates after cleavage. Its endonuclease activity depends upon Mn 2+ ions as co-factors. Conserved in Nidovirus, it acts as an important genetic marker due to its absence in other RNA viruses (Ivanov et al, 2004) . As illustrated in figure  32D , Bruno and colleagues deduced a 2.6Å crystal structure (PDB ID: 2H85) of Uridylatespecific Nsp15 using X-ray diffraction. The monomeric Nsp15 has three domains: N-terminal domain (1-62 residues) formed by a three anti-parallel -sheets and two α-helices packed together; a middle domain (63-191 residues) contains an α-helix connect to a 39 amino acids long coil to two α and five region; and a C-terminal domain (192-345 residues) consisting of two anti-parallel three -sheets on each side of a central α-helical core (Ricagno et al, 2006) . author/funder.

Calculated mean PPID of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV is 1.73%, 2.60%, and 2.60%, respectively. Predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in residues of Nsp15 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 Human SARS and Bat CoV are represented in graphs in figure 32A , 32B, and 32C. No significant disorder was revealed in studied Nsp15 proteins.
Nsp16 protein is another Mtase domain-containing protein. As methylation of coronavirus mRNAs occurs in steps, three protein Nsp10, Nsp14 and Nsp16 acts one after another. The first event requires the initiation trigger from Nsp10 protein after which Nsp14 methylates capped mRNAs forming cap-0 (7Me) GpppA-RNAs. Nsp16 protein along with its co-activator protein Nsp10 acts on cap-0 (7Me) GpppA-RNAs to give rise to final cap-1 (7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)-RNAs (Bouvet et al, 2010; Decroly et al, 2008) .

The structure consists of a characteristic fold present in class I MTase family comprising of α-helices and loops surrounding a sevenstranded β-sheet (Chen et al, 2011) . Nsp16 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is found equally similar with Nsp16 proteins of Human SARS and Bat CoV (93.29%) (Supplementary Figure S2H) . As observed using different predictors, mean PPIDs SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are 5.37%, 3.02%, and 3.02%. Graphs in figure 33A , 33B, and 33C show the predicted predisposition for intrinsic disorder in nsp16 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV, respectively. We found no disorder in Nsp16 proteins which are observed to be structured.
This is an uncharacterized protein cleaved from replicase polyprotein 1a. The small protein with unknown function requires experimental insights to further characterize this protein. The software used in this study requires >30 amino acid sequence, therefore, due to short sequence of all three studied coronaviruses Nsp11 proteins do not show any disordered residue. MSA of Nsp11 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is found to have a similarity of 84.62% with Nsp11 proteins of Human SARS and Bat CoV (Figure 34) . 
The emergence of viruses and associated deaths around the globe is a major concern to mankind. There is very little information available in the public domain regarding protein structure and functions of SARS-CoV-2 yet. Based on the similarity with Human SARS and Bat CoV, the published reports have suggested the functions of its proteins. Using available information on its genome and translated proteome from Genbank, we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of disorderedness present in proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a comparison is also made with its close relatives from the same group of beta coronaviruses; Human SARS and Bat CoV. As result suggested, the N proteins are predicted to be highly disordered having more than 60% of PPID. Another moderately disordered protein is encoded from ORF6, which downregulates the interferon pathway. All other proteins have shown less disordered regions depicting a three-dimensional structure in the native state. Generally, IDPs undergo structural transition upon association with their physiological partners, therefore, this study will help to understand the interaction of other viral proteins as well as host proteins in different physiological conditions. This will also guide structural biologists to carry out a structure-based analysis of its genome to explore the path for the development of new drugs and vaccines.
The periodical outbreaks of pathogens worldwide always remind the lack of suitable drugs or vaccines for proper cure or treatment. In 2003, nearly 750 deaths were reported due to the SARS outbreak in more than 24 countries, but this time, the outbreak of Wuhan's novel coronavirus has surpassed this number quickly indicating more causalities in near future. The lack of accurate information and ignorance of primary symptoms are major reasons which cause many infection cases. The actual reason for SARS-CoV-2 spread is still unknown but some assumptions made by researchers and Chinese authorities, and also confirmed its transmission from human to human. It also has made major impacts on education and economy worldwide due to several restrictions such as traveling, transportation. Due to advancements in distinguished techniques, the full genome sequence was made available in a few days of the first infection report from Wuhan, China. But further research needs to be done to identify its actual cause and suitable treatment in the coming future. There are certain possibilities that can be explored with the available information. More in-depth experimental studies using molecular and cell biology to establish structure-function relationships are required to understand its proper functioning. Additionally, based on homology and other information on protein-protein interaction, the associated viral and host proteins should be explored which help in carrying out replication, maturation, and ultimately pathogenesis. Using structural biology, various purposes including drug development could be achieved such as high throughput screening of compounds virtually as well as experimentally. The thorough experimental disorder analysis of three coronaviruses in this study will also help to structure biologists to design experiments keeping this information in mind.

1ad1d4b84aea4ceaf05c62a1ad04e7150f7f4684,"Clinical assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 respiratory illness, has been a major activity of infectious diseases services in the UK and elsewhere since the first report of cases in December 2019. We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29 th Jan 2020 and 24 th Feb 2020.
Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.
A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir.
The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.","SARS-CoV-2 is a recently named novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of respiratory disease named COVID-19, arising in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] [2] [3] . At the time of writing (27 th Feb 2020) the overwhelming majority of cases have been reported from inside China, however single or small numbers of cases have been confirmed in 46 other countries. Transmission has occurred in some countries outside China 4,5 , including the UK 6 .
In the UK, public health and clinical services have been working to identify suspected cases according to a national case definition and to arrange testing, predominantly by real-time PCR of nose and throat swabs. Since testing began, local procedures and national guidelines have changed in response to changing understanding of the disease and demand for testing. On the evening of 06/02/2020 the UK definition of a suspected case was extended to include people presenting with respiratory illness (defined as cough, shortness of breath or fever with or without other symptoms) returning from or transiting through China including Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan or Thailand within the last 14 days, with the case definition subsequently changing further on 25/02/2020 to include northern Italy, Iran and further countries in SE Asia. As of 27/02/2020, 7690 tests have been performed nationally, of which 15 were positive (0.2%). Initially, testing has been led by clinicians, predominantly by infectious diseases or emergency department physicians, although there are plans to move to a community testing model led by other groups of healthcare professionals, and some regions have already done so. Patients are instructed to selfisolate while results are pending and until their symptoms have resolved, with possible financial and health implications for the 99.8% so far in the UK who have an illness other than COVID-19. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic when a syndromic management strategy with presumptive treatment and self-isolation was used, initial clinical diagnoses of influenza were reported to delay diagnoses of a number of diseases including primary HIV infection 7 and Plasmodium falciparum malaria 8 , and although scoring systems were developed it remains difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial pneumonia on clinical grounds 9 . In addition, many mild respiratory viral infections were managed as influenza 10 , with significant resource implications, both for healthcare services and patients Here we describe our experience of the first 68 patients we have tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a Regional Infectious Diseases unit (RIDU) in the UK. We present the spectrum of illness, alternative diagnoses made and management provided. This is of particular interest at this stage of the epidemic, where many individuals meeting the definition of a suspected case are returning travellers, where the differential diagnosis of respiratory or undifferentiated febrile illness may be broad 11 . These findings have implications for the clinical and logistical support that may be required for roll-out of community testing to be a safe and effective replacement for the current predominantly hospitalbased, physician-led system.
The RIDU at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust is based at Castle Hill Hospital, East Yorkshire, UK and serves a population of 1.2 million people. Patients were predominately referred following telephone assessment by the national NHS 111 service, using Public Health England (PHE) case definitions. Patients were assessed by an infection clinician either in the infectious diseases ward, the ambulance or the patient's car that had transferred them to the unit, and in one instance in the emergency department of the trust. The first 68 consecutive cases are presented here.
All patients had symptoms recorded, together with a travel and exposure history for at least the 14 days preceding symptom onset. Due to the use of personal protective equipment and in some cases assessment in the patient's car, clinical examination and observations varied between cases.
Patients were managed as outpatients if clinically stable and able to self-isolate. All cases were tested for SARS2-CoV using a combined throat and naso-pharyngeal (NP) swab, which were processed at the designated public health laboratory. A separate NP swab was tested locally using the BioFire Film Array Respiratory Panel 2 plus (BioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) which can detect 21 targets (17 viral and 4 bacterial). Blood samples were only performed on patients being admitted or where another serious diagnosis was being considered.
Data were entered directly from clinical notes into a centrally held password protected spreadsheet, to facilitate patient follow up and data analysis. Clinical features, observations, investigations, management and outcomes are presented with descriptive statistics where relevant. Local clinical governance approval was granted to record the data as an ongoing service evaluation. As all care delivered to patients was routine, no ethical approval is necessary in keeping with UK national guidance that this is an evaluation of a current NHS service.
The timeline of cases seen is shown in figure 1 . With the change in case definition to include those returning from SE Asia, the number of cases markedly increased from an initial mean of 0.9 cases / day to 3.3 / day. 15 / 68 patients (23%) were admitted to the unit, with the remaining patients being managed in an ambulatory manner. Of those admitted, six were only admitted as they could not effectively self-isolate pending results. Mean length of hospital stay in those admitted was 2.4 days (range 1 -10 days). 10 patients (15%) had returned from China in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms, with 26 of the cases (38%) having visited the most common country of travel, Thailand.
Eight patients had not left the UK in the preceding 14 days and were seen as contacts of confirmed or suspected cases.
Of the 68 patients seen 36 were female (53%), with a mean age of 42.5 years (range 0.5 -76). Table   1 shows the presenting features of the cases seen. In addition to the symptoms shown in the table, three cases (4%) had headache, three (4%) had ear pain and nine (13%) had diarrhoea (two with vomiting as well). Table 2 shows the baseline physical observations, with seven patients (10%) having a temperature of 37.5° or greater on assessment. Antimicrobial therapy was prescribed to nine patients (1.3%), with doxycycline given to five patients (78%), moxifloxacin to three (4%), and oseltamivir to one confirmed influenza A case (1%).

We have presented our experience of testing for SARS-CoV-2 at a UK university teaching hospital.
Sixty-eight individuals, including 2 children, were tested over 26 days. The majority were ambulant and able to self-isolate, and had features consistent with an upper respiratory tract viral infection, or common cold. After the first 10 cases, 6/58 (10.3%) were admitted, at least three of whom only because they lived in shared accommodation where self-isolation was unrealistic, rather than on clinical grounds. This observation supports a community testing approach for the majority. Five of fifty individuals were prescribed antimicrobials without being admitted, emphasising the importance of the availability of clinical decision makers and prescribers for more unwell patients. None of our cases had severe respiratory illness requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, suggesting it will be rare that patients meeting the definition of a suspected case will require enhanced care, at least while COVID-19 itself remains rare in the UK. Some COVID-19 case series have suggested up to 20% of cases may require respiratory support 2,12 , although this figure may be influenced by ascertainment bias. If more generalised outbreaks occur outside China, we may start to see severe COVID-19 presenting to UK healthcare services.
Specialist Infectious Diseases consultant-delivered assessment of a group of patients who predominantly have mild illness is unlikely to be sustainable, especially as the case-definition broadens to include a wider geographical area and/or COVID-19 patients requiring inpatient care becomes more common in the UK. There was a step-change in the number of suspected cases seen after the introduction of the third case definition on the evening of 6 th February 2020 as a high number of people with respiratory symptoms and recent travel suddenly became suspected of having COVID-19. As there is further spread in the coming weeks, as is the case in Italy and Iran, and the epidemiological criteria of the case definition is notably extended again, Infectious Diseases clinicians will be unable to sustain a hospital-based screening service. The NHS is responding to this challenge by moving to a community provider screening model, which will deliver the majority of testing in the home.
Specialist input and assessment, supported by appropriate laboratory investigations must be easily accessible to a COVID-19 testing service, especially if delivered by health care workers other than Infectious Diseases physicians. This is important for patients in the self-isolation periods both before .

This may apply particularly to patients with pre-existing lung disease, where respiratory viral illness, caused by SARS-CoV-2 or otherwise, may trigger clinical deterioration that could ordinarily be managed by early community intervention. Infectious Diseases physicians may be the group best placed to support patients in this situation for the short period of self-isolation, 13 especially given the need for ongoing personal protective equipment use 14 . Although we did not observe any imported ""tropical"" infections such as dengue, malaria, typhoid, rickettsiosis or leptospirosis, these remain important differential diagnoses in returning travellers from some areas of South East Asia and may be life-threatening if missed 8, 15 . These diagnoses may become more common in this group now that the definition of a suspected case has been expanded to include other countries in South or South East Asia such as Vietnam. Individuals receiving testing for COVID-19 should be signposted to an accessible clinical service with an understanding of this differential diagnosis in case of worsening illness.
Our data from the routine virological testing performed is in keeping with community based results
showing that symptoms and viral detection do not always go together 16 and shows a different spectrum to those patients admitted and tested using the same assay 17 , with fewer influenza diagnoses and a greater proportion of rhinovirus / enterovirus as well as seasonal coronaviruses cases. A recent report from Italy 18 , immediately before the recent increase in SARS-CoV-2 detection showed a greater proportion of influenza B than in our cohort, which may be explainable by the differing geographical exposures between the two groups.
Admitting individuals to a secondary care facility, even for short periods of assessment, may have other drawbacks. Travellers to South East Asia, particularly those who received antibiotics or were admitted to healthcare facilities, can potentially carry and transmit carbapenem-producing enterobacteriaceae. Additionally, because these patients need to be more pragmatically managed than patients not suspected of COVID-19, they may be more likely to be exposed to antimicrobial therapy. There are also significant resource implications not just in terms of PPE use but predominantly in terms of the time required to don and doff PPE for every care interaction from bringing food to routine observations to clinical review. This burden can be at least partially alleviated through a home testing approach.
Infection clinician time is another important resource that may not be best used in managing mild respiratory illness that meets the suspected COVID-19 case definition. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated the benefit of ID physician review in terms of clinical outcome and resource utilisation in infections such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia 19, 20 and resistant gram-negative infections 21 . Our findings support the assessment of, and testing for, possible COVID-19 by other cadres of healthcare workers, outside the secondary care setting, but supported by specialist physicians and hospital based further diagnostics where needed. The optimum configuration for such a service remains unclear and is likely to vary depending on local constraints, but during the containment phase of the epidemic response there may be time to pilot and compare a range of models before we are forced to move to delay and possibly mitigation strategies. .

1b4ab28a9391d516e1753874c73d2d244104f825,"The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3 . Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 4-6 , the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7,8 . However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride 9,10 ) or the PBM (SB203580 5 ), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.","The current epidemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a rising global health emergency (WHO https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) with disruptive health, social and economic repercussions. Three major actions, confinement, detection and therapy are required to contain this pandemic. Detection and therapy can be guided by virus sequence data, which was first made available in 17 December, 2019 at gsaid.org, soon after detection of the first cases. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data are a pivotal resource on its own, but can gain greater value when embedded within those of other Betacoronavirus, allowing a comparative pangenomic analysis. This approach can help identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2. Whereas core genomic features are required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence. Genome annotation and structural modelling can then be used to assess the possible functions of these accessory features and guide approaches to detection and treatment.
Here we apply a comparative pangenomic approach of all Betacoronavirus genomes sequenced thus far (Table 1) , to detect the core and accessory gene cluster of this genus, and then annotate the functions, further assessed through structural analysis. Furthermore, we provide insights into importance, key features and differences in the Envelope protein, E, conserved separately in SARS, MERS and coronaviruses from other animals.
We used a pangenome approach to explore the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN985325 and related isolates) in comparison to other Betacornaviruses, including SARS and MERS. Previous approaches 11 proceeded by extracting individual genes, aligning them, and then establishing a phylogeny. Our approach differs in that we first cluster all sequences to then calculate the alignment. This approach, based on using panX 12 , allows us to achieve a higher sensibility in the detection of gene clusters. The resulting pangenome including all core and accessory gene clusters, interactive trees and alignments from 24 Betacoronavirus genomes, including 4 isolates from SARS-CoV-2, is available at https://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/.
There are five essential genes in coronaviruses, the Spike protein (S), Membrane glycoprotein (M), Nucleocapsid (N), envelope protein (E) and the Orf1ab (a large polyprotein known as replicase/protease), all required to produce a structurally complete viral particle 13 . These five genes define the core pan-genome. However, panX 12 only retrieved four of these (S, M, N and the ORF1ab) as components of the core pan-genome ( Figure 1 ). However, the fifth gene in the Betacoronavirus core genome, the envelope protein (E), varied among genomes, defining three distinct subclusters within the envelope protein E of Betacoronaviruses ( Figure 2 ). One of these E clusters comprises only SARS-CoV-1 (AY274119), SARS-CoV-2 and two Bat Coronaviruses (MG772933 and KF63652). Among the other two protein E gene clusters, one includes MERS (JX869059 and KC164505) and several coronaviruses from different animals, while the third cluster includes coronaviruses from two Rousettus bats. To validate the conservation and specificity of the SARS E cluster, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 E sequence with all known sequences in NCBI's non redundant (NR) protein database. This comparison showed, consistent with our pan-genome analysis, that the subcluster of the protein E gene appearing in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and two bat coronaviruses, is defined by the same essential functional features, which are exactly conserved (100% similarity) between bats and SARS-CoV-2, but differ slightly (95% similarity with one deletion and three substitutions) from SARS ( Figure 2B and supplementary figure 7) . A recent study compared genomes and gene families of all alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses, but did not explore the variability present within the protein E gene sequences, which we did through the clustering approach reported above.
We found five accessory gene clusters (15% of the accessory genome of genus Betacoronavirus) common to SARS-like coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, out of 33 total accessory gene clusters. Four of these gene clusters (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8, Fig. 1A ), appear only in SARS-CoV-2, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and the SARS virus. A gene cluster annotated as ORF10 appeared to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1) . However, a blast-based search against the DNA of all sequences in NCBI's NT database showed that the ORF10 sequence matches with 100% coverage in DNA of other SARS-like genomes, but there is no open-reading frame predicted for those genomes in the matching region ( Fig 1A) . Hence, the apparent uniqueness of ORF10 might simply be an artifact of the GeneBank annotation pipeline that did not predict an ORF for this gene in other matching genomes. However, for completeness, we report a functional analysis of ORF10 as Supplementary material (Supplementary material 1) since at present there is no experimental evidence available against or in favor of this being a real gene.
Compared to the essential genes S, M, N, E and ORF1ab, other genes such as ORF3a and ORF7a are poorly characterized, according to GenBank annotations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/proteins/86693?genome_assembly_id=760344). Our bioinformatic protein structural analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a (cluster 12), also known as viroporin, and ORF7a (cluster 17), that is same as ORF8a 14 in SARS, retain the structural features observed in other SARS viruses, namely a multi-pass transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic b-barrel or b-sandwich fold (ORF3a) and an N-terminal secpathway signal peptide, cleaved after residue 15, an immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich fold stabilized by two cysteine di-sulfide bonds, and a C-terminal single-pass transmembrane helix (ORF7a; Supplementary Figures 5,6 ). Hence these SARS-CoV-2 proteins are expected to act in the same way as they do in other SARS, namely as accessory proteins mostly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, but also occurring on the cell membrane where they enhance viral pathogenicity and mortality through protein-protein interactions [15] [16] [17] .
The remaining two accessory gene clusters, ORF6, ORF8, present in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and bat-SL-CoVZC45 are functionally uncharacterized. All are very short polypeptides (61, 121 and 38 residues for ORF6 and 8, respectively) with a large percentage of hydrophobic residues (62%, 56%, respectively). None of the proteins have trans-membrane regions, but ORF8 has an N-terminal sec-pathway signal peptide with a cleavage site after residues 15, suggesting that it is secreted into the extracellular space ( Supplementary Figures 5,6 ). Following signal peptide cleavage, the ORF8 protein core is predicted to consist largely of b-strands and features 7 cysteines. We predict that this protein adopts a cysteine disulfide-bond stabilized b-sandwich structure similar to the soluble domain of ORF7a (Supplementary Figures 5,6 ), inferring that ORF8 also functions as ligand binding module. ORF6 consists of a long amphipathic helical region, followed by an acidic tail. Our deep-learning-based annotation (DeepGOPlus 18 ) suggested that ORFs 6, 7, 8 are involved in the regulation of molecular functions, either in response to stimuli (ORFs 8), or in cellular component biogenesis and organization (ORF6) (Suppl. Figure 2-4) . Collectively, our analysis suggested no major function or gene cluster to be unique to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our analysis is in agreement with ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 8 and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.952895 doi: bioRxiv preprint being accessory non-essential proteins, that would be inefficient targets for COVID-2019 therapy.
The S protein binds to the host receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3 . We therefore focused our attention on the protein E, which is highly similar in SARS-CoV. The E protein, also a viroporin 19 , was previously confirmed as a determinant of pathogenicity 4,5 in SARS-CoV-1. Protein E was used as target for SARS antivirals 6 , and studies using SARS-CoV with lacking or mutated protein E as vaccine candidates showed promising results [20] [21] [22] [23] . Furthermore, the E gene is one of the key genes used in identification of SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR 7,24 .
The SARS-Cov-1 protein E has ion channel (IC) activity and features a postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif (PBM). Both IC and PBM were required for SARS-CoV to induce virulence in mice 14 . The protein E from SARS-CoV-2 differs from that of SARS-CoV-1 only by three substitutions and one deletion (Figure 2A Studies on SARS-CoV-1 demonstrated that the E protein uses the IC and PBM to trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs. Ultimately these events result in ARDS 4-6 , a leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7, 8 . However, the drugs Amantadine, Hexamethylene amiloride and also BIT225 (BIT225 is in clinical trials) completely block the IC activity of SARS-CoV-1 9,10 and restrict its reproduction, leading to better survival of the animal host. The PBM enables the E protein to interact with the cellular PDZ domains. Its association with the tandem PDZ domains of syntenin activates the MAP kinase p38, triggering the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, inhibition of p38 by SB203580 increases the survival of the host 5 .
The high level of conservation of the IC and PBM within clade 2, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, strongly suggests that the available inhibitors for the E protein of SARS-CoV-1 should also be active on SARS-CoV-2.
Therapies to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the lethality caused by the resulting COVID-2019 are currently focusing primarily on S, the viral spike protein 3,25,26 . However, despite high similarities between proteins S between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, existing neutralizing antibodies are ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 3 . Hence, new antibodies that bind specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein need to be developed, tested and approved for human use, which would be a time-consuming process.
Our pangenomic analysis suggests that the protein E of all SARS viruses preserves its critical motifs used for pathogenesis. Hence, we predict that the readily available and approved inhibitors (Amantadine, Hexamethylene amiloride and SB203580), that proved efficient for alleviating ARDS in SARS-CoV-1-infected animal models should also be effective against SARS-CoV-2. While not preventing future spreading of the virus, these inhibitors might reduce the mortality rate while effective vaccines are being developed.
Collection of Betacoronavirus strains. The NCBI genome assemblies page was searched, on January 26, for taxonid of genus Betacoronavirus, resulting in a list of 22 genomes, including four isolates of SARS-CoV-2. We downloaded in addition to this initial list two more assemblies one for a bat coronavirus (MG772933) and another for MERS (KF600630), see Table 1 . For easy identification of genes and annotations from GenBank, we included unique locus_tag identifiers containing locus id and an index number. Metadata was collected to define user friendly strain names and to understand phylogenetic trees in the context of virus host, country, taxon id and data release date.
Creating a pangenome for Betacoronavirus GenBank annotation and sequences were used as a starting point for this pangenomic analysis study. These GenBank annotations contain heterogeneous identifiers for genes so we included unique locus tags containing the strain accession number and gene index number for computational processing. In addition, we collected metadata for these coronaviruses for displaying on the interactive phylogenetic trees for analysis later on. Gene sequences were compared to each other for sequence similarity, followed by gene clustering. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the core gene clusters to produce a species tree and similarly for each gene cluster to produce gene trees. For this pangenome analysis we used panX 12 (Ding et al., 2018 ) that takes GenBank files as input and extracts gene coordinates, annotations from GenBank and sequences from these genomes on both nucleotide and protein levels. For interactive visualization of pangenome clusters, alignments and phylogenetic trees we used panX visualization module obtain from github, https://github.com/neherlab/pan-genomevisualization/. Other databases showing greater detail about many viruses, such as Virus Pathogen Resource (VIPR, https://www.viprbrc.org) and GSAID (https://www.gisaid.org) are very useful but these resources do not provide gene clustering or pan-genome analysis.
Re-annotation of proteins from Betacoronavirus genomes using KAUST Metagenomic Analysis Platform (KMAP) annotation pipeline. To annotate uncharacterized genes in Betacoronavirus, we utilized all available protein sequences available from the clustering analysis as an input to our Automatic Annotation of Microbial Genomes (AAMG) pipeline 27 , available via KAUST Metagenomic Analysis Platform (http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/kmap). AAMG uses sequence-based BLAST to UniProtKB (www.uniprot.org), KEGG (www.kegg.jp) and also Protein Family (PFam) domain detection using InterPro (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro).
Prediction of function using DeepGOPlus. We used all genes from Betacoronavirus dataset in order to explore Gene Ontology predictions through our in-house DeepGOPlus 18 tool that combines deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model with sequence similarity-based predictions to derive relevant functional classes from Gene Ontology alongside a confidence score. Results were included with a score 0.1 and filtered for class specificity. Predicted Gene Ontology (GO) terms with a confidence score from DeepGOPlus were visualized using QuickGO (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/) for SARS-CoV-2 specific gene clusters. DeepGOPlus is available on github, https://github.com/bioontology-research-group/DeepGOPlus Structure based prediction of function ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protparam/protparam) was used for calculating protein features. Phobius (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/) and SignalP-5.0 were used for prediction of transmembrane regions and signal peptides 28 . Jpred4 was used to calculate secondary structure features (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/). 3D modelling was carried out using SwissModel (homology modelling) 29 or QUARK (ab initio structure predictions) 30 .
IA, TG and CMD conceived and designed the research, IA led the study and conducted the data analysis, A.K. helped developed the web-based resource and led computational components of the study, MK and SA contributed to the functional structural analysis, and AP contributed with inferences on virulence. IA and CMD developed the first draft of the manuscript and all authors contributed to writing and improving the manuscript, and approved the submission. 
A short gene predicted in in SARS-CoV-2, known as ORF10, appears unique only to SARS-CoV-2. A sequence comparison of this gene to DNA of all Betacoronavirus genomes in NCBI shows matches in SARS and SARS-like genomes with 100% coverage, although no gene has been predicted in matching location of ORF10 in SARS or SARS-like genomes. This raises a question whether ORF10 is an artifact of annotation in SARS-CoV-2 where it has been predicted or an artifact in SARS and SARS-like genomes where it has not been predicted. There is no experimental data available to approve or disprove the reality of this gene. For completeness purposes we included ORF10 in our functional and structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not included in the main text.
Supplementary Figure 4 -6 shows predicted Gene Ontology and structural information about ORF10 using deep learning Gene Ontology Prediction tool (DeepGOplus). It shows that, similar to ORF8, this gene regulates molecular functions and contributes to response to stimulus. It is predicted to be localized only in the extracellular region of the host cells. OF10 is predicted to harbor a long helix followed by a b-strand and appears to be localized only in the extracellular region of the host cells. It has been concluded that SARS-CoV-2 accessory genes, including ORF10, carry a helper function and do not serve as a major target for detection or therapy of COVID-2019.
Supplementary Figure 1 . DeepGOPlus predicted Gene Ontology Graph for SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, E. According to predictions, the protein can be localized in the host cell Golgi apparatus, vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane cell periphery of the host cell. It contributes to the process of disruption of the host cell and viral budding from Golgi membrane. Figure 7 . Alignment of SARS-CoV-2 E protein comparison to hits available in NCBI's NR database. The first two appear from SARS-CoV-2 and rest of the hits appear from SARS and SARS-like Betacoronaviruses. This result shows SARS-CoV-2 E protein is conserved only in SARS clade and E from MERS or other animal coronaviruses clusters in different clusters (see Figure 2 ).

City of China obtained global concern, the population outflow from Wuhan has 18 contributed to spatial expansion in other parts of China. We examined the effects of 19 population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces 20 and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed 21 a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of 22 cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two 23 days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days 24 later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest 25 that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection 26 transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the 27 epidemic. 28","In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases caused by a novel coronavirus, 33 namely 2019-nCoV, emerged in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in China 34

Epidemiology evidence shown that most of the cases had a 39 history of living or travelling to Wuhan, the household cluster cases and cases of 40 health-care workers indicated the human-to-human transmission route (3), which 41 might be the reason for a rapid increasing rate of infection across the country and 42 globally (4). 43
Considering the person-to-person transmission and the large travel volume during 44 the traditional Chinese New Year (the largest annual population movement in the 45 world), it is expected that the population movement would lead to further expansion 46 of the infection, so the government imposed a lockdown on Wuhan City at 10:00 am 47 on January 23, as well as some other cities later on. However, an estimated 5 million 48 individuals had already left Wuhan for the holiday or travelling, some of which rushed 49 out after the lockdown announcement (5). In addition, the novel coronavirus is 50 infectious during the incubation period and when the symptoms are not obvious, 51 which is likely to make the huge floating population potential sources of infection (6). 52 Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the population transported from Wuhan 53 may have a significant impact on the potential outbreaks in other parts of China. 54 Recent studies on the novel coronavirus pneumonia focused more on its etiology (7, 55 8), transmission route (9, 10), and epidemiological characteristics (11, 12), there is 56 still a lack of investigating the relationship between the migrating population and the 57 outbreak, which is of great importance for making intervention policies.

After the city closure was taken in force, some population still outflowed from Wuhan. 105
We subtracted the outflow index on Jan 23 from the average outflow index from Jan 106 24 to 31, to obtain the index of outflow population within Wuhan reduced by the 107 advance city closure on Jan 23 and 22 (the advance outflow index). And then we 108 calculated the average proportion of the outflow index from Jan 24 to 31 for each 109 province (the average proportion). The number of cases reduced by the advance city 110 closure in each province was estimated by multiplied the advance outflow index by 111 the average proportion and one corresponding unit. The formula can be specified as: 112
The reduced index of outflow population: 
The net loss index of outflow population caused by advance Wuhan city closure for 124 each province: 125
The total reduced number of 2019-nCoV cases: 127
Similarly, we evaluated the impacts of one-day and two-day delayed city closure. We 129 took the average index of the population outflow between Jan 21 and 23 as the daily 130 index of population outflow before the city closure, and used the same calculation 131 method to estimate the index of population outflow within Wuhan increased by the 132 delayed city closure on Jan 24 and Jan 25 (the delayed outflow index). We multiplied 133 the delayed outflow index by the average proportion and one corresponding unit to 134 estimate the increased number of cases caused by one-day and two-day delayed city 135 closure in each province. Our study provided timely evidence for the formulation of efficient strategies to 253 prevent diseases from spreading out. On the one hand, the result could help assess 254 effectiveness of the prevention and control efforts. For example, the cases in Zhejiang 255 and Guangdong are apparently more than estimated, which indicated a better health 256 emergency response system (i.e. higher detection efficiency) or inadequate isolation. 257
Whereas the cases reported in Henan were much lower than expected. Two possible 258 .

In addition, to explore the impact of date selection, 282
we estimated the changes of cases when the measure was implemented on different 283 date. The results varied significantly, 1420 cases could be prevented with the measure 284 implemented two days earlier, and the number of cases will increase by 1462 with the 285 lockdown implemented two days later, suggesting that the effect of the lockdown 286 depending on the choice of date greatly, which could provide a reference for the 287 future outbreaks. Since the political and economic effects were not considered, further 288 studies on secondary impacts of the measure, like socioeconomic impacts, were also 289 warranted. Though we estimated that some cases would possibly be prevented if the 290 policy was implemented earlier, it was actually hard to make such a huge decision 291
given the whole picture of the infection was not clear at that stage. The authors 292 believe that the current policy was appropriate at this complex situation. 293
There were a few limitations of our study. Firstly, for practical reasons, we used 294 an indicator to reflect the real-time magnitude of population movements, which was 295 acceptable considering our research purpose. Secondly, the influence of some 296 important factors, such as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, were not 297 considered. Thirdly, it is assumed that the infected travelers in the population are 298 randomly distributed (28), and that there was no significant difference in surveillance 299 capability between cities (18), which might not be the case in reality. In addition, 300 daily data used in this study was reported infection data, rather than the actual number 301 of incident cases. More detailed and further in-depth studies are warranted in the 302 .

In conclusion, our study indicates that the population outflow from Wuhan might 304 be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the 305 policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic and earlier implementation 306 would be more effective. The magnitude of epidemic might be under-estimated and 307 should be paid more attention, such as Henan and Hunan provinces. 308 309","Population movement, city closure and spatial transmission of the 2019-nCoV 1 infection in China 2",medrxiv,10.1101/2020.02.04.20020339,,,medrvix,2020-02-05,Siqi Ai; Guanghu Zhu; Fei Tian; Huan Li; Yuan Gao; Yinglin Wu; Qiyong Liu; Hualiang Lin,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv
1b9fed2824e97db8cb35912549dd2e9cde7b6c18,"The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC 50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a coronavirus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China.
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV has been transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly have some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-toperson spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. The 2019-nCoV is spreading from person to person in China and limited spread among close contacts has been detected in some countries outside China. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. There is currently no vaccine to protect against 2019-nCoV.
According to Lu et al, 2020 [1] , genome sequence of 2019-nCoV is closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Two complete virus genomes (HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b) are sequenced from 2019-nCoV infected patients [2] . HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b differ from each other by only two bases. One of them is a non-synonymous mutation at amino acid position 336 of non-structural protein 4 (Ser336 for HKU-SZ-002a; Leu336 for HKU-SZ-005b). The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domain of Spike subunit 1 of this novel coronavirus is around 66% identical to those of the SARS-related coronaviruses, and the core domain of the receptor binding domain of this novel coronavirus has about 68% amino acid identity with those of the SARS-related coronavirus. But the protein sequence of the external subdomain region of receptor binding domain of Spike subunit 1 has only 39% identity, which might affect the choice of human receptor and therefore the biological activity of this virus.
Coronaviruses encode large replicase polyproteins which are proteolytically processed by viral proteases to generate mature nonstructural proteins (nsps) that form the viral replication complex. Positive-strand RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, can induce cellular membrane rearrangements during replication to form replication organelles which allows efficient viral RNA synthesis. Nonstructural Protein 4 alone induces membrane pairing in infectious bronchitis virus [3] . Infection with coronavirus causes rearrangement in the host cell membrane to accumulate a replication and transcription complex in which replication of the viral genome and transcription of viral mRNA can occur. For coronaviruses, a major pathogenicity factor has now been identified with non-structural protein 1 in a murine model of coronavirus infection [4] . Sakai et al in 2017 [5] highlighted the role of nsp4 of SARS coronavirus in viral replication. It has been discovered that only a change in two amino acids in nsp4 protein sequence can abolish viral replication completely. So, to prevent coronavirus infection by designing vaccine, nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus can be selected as target protein in this study.
Prevention of viral diseases by vaccination purposes for controlled induction of protective immune responses against viral pathogens such as small pox, hepatitis etc. Attenuated viral vaccines can be produced by targeting essential pathogenicity factors. This study has implicated for the rational design of live attenuated coronavirus vaccines aiming to prevent coronavirus-induced diseases of human as well as animal origin, including the lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome.
In this study nonstructural protein 4 has been analyzed in order to predict informative epitopes which will help for future vaccine designing. The knowledge of peptide vaccine is used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes which can induce specific immune responses [6] , [7] . These designed epitopes will offer cost effective, high quality therapeutics against corona virus. By using online algorithms in immunoinformatics, potentially active immunogenic T and B cell epitopes for this viral protein has been identified and modelled to design possible peptide vaccine for coronavirus infection.
The protein family information of Coronavirus nonstructural protein NS4 containing 78 protein is retrieved from InterPro database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR005603/). To find conserved region, retrieved sequences were aligned using Muscle tool 3.8.31 [8] where k-mer clustering is used. In the next step a phylogenetic tree is constructed by the method known as progressive alignment. The evolutionary divergence analysis for all 78 virus proteins are completed by forming a phylogenetic tree using Phy ML 3.1/3.0 aLRT software [9] . Here the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the maximum likelihood method. The default substitution model was selected assuming an estimated proportional of invariant sites (of 0.008) and 4 gammadistributed rate categorized to account for rate heterogenicity across sites. The gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from the data (gamma = 1.788). Reliability for internal branch was assessed using the aLRT test (SH-like).
Among these proteins non-structural protein NS4, with accession number A0A0A7UXD8, known as Beta coronavirus HKU24 (due to its Chinese origin) with length 136 is selected in FASTA format.
Antigenicity of this protein is predicted by VaxiJen v 2.0, an online prediction server [10] .
B cell epitopes are part of allergen which come in interaction with B lymphocytes to induce immune response. Among two types of B cell epitopes, linear type of B cell epitopes is predicted.
Various physico-chemical properties e.g. hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, turns, exposed surface, polarity and antigenic propensity of peptides chains have been estimated to identify the locations of linear epitopes of an antigenic protein [11] . Thus, different tools from IEDB (www.iedb.org), including the classical propensity scale methods such as Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale [12] , E mini surface accessibility prediction [13] , Parker hydrophilicity prediction [14] , Karplus and Schulz flexibilty prediction [15] , Bepipred linear epitope prediction [16] and Chou and Fashman beta turn prediction tool [17] are used to predict linear or continous B cell epitopes of nonstructural protein NS4 protein in coronavirus. With the help of graphical findings and prediction scores the most probable B cell epitope of that antigenic protein has been identified. BepiPred prediction method is a combination of Hidden Markov model and propensity scale method to predict score and identification of B cell epitopes of antigenic protein [16] .
Linear T-cell epitopes for MHC-I binding for nonstructural protein NS4 protein in coronavirus are recognized by consensus methods using various methods such as Artificial neural network (ANN) [18] , Stabilized matrix method (SMM) [19] and Scoring Matrices Derived from Combinatorial Peptide Libraries (Comblib) from tools for MHC -I binding prediction methods of Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (www.iedb.org) [20] . This serverbased method forecasts the MHC class I binding predication to 26 MHC supertypes as percentile rank. SMM algorithm of MHC-1 binding, transporter of antigenic peptides (TAP) transport efficiency and proteasomal cleavage efficiency are also considered to determine the IC 50 values for processing prediction of epitopes by MHC-I molecules [21] . On the basis of low IC 50 values, 5 best epitopes bind with specific MHC-1 molecules are elected for further evaluation.
CD4+ T-cell receptor responses against concerned nonstructural protein NS4 protein are done by using Peptide binding to MHC class II molecules software using MHC II binding prediction tool in IEDB analysis resource, including a consensus approach which combines NNalign, SMM-align [21] and Combinatorial library methods. For this prediction we chose thirty HLA class II alleles from the reference set. For the predicted T-cell epitopes with low percentile rank are identified and their IC50 values for respective alleles are determined by SMM-align method [22] .
Population coverage for identified T cell epitopes is assessed for world, as well as China and Indian population with the help of IEDB population coverage calculation tool [23] . This tool calculates the fraction of individuals predicted to reply to a specified set of epitopes with recognized MHC restrictions. This calculation is finished considering the HLA genotypic frequencies assuming non-linkage disequilibrium between HLA loci.
For docking studies, the T cell epitope PTDTYTSVY (MHC I restricted) and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG (MHC II restricted) are selected and subjected to PEP-FOLD server [24] , [25] for 3D structure formation. To identify the molecular interactions with specific HLA protein for respective epitopes, docking studies are performed with ClusPro 2.2 web server [26] . Cluster scores for lowest binding energy prediction are calculated using the formula-E = 0.40E_{rep} + -0.40E_{att} + 600E_{elec} + 1.00E_{DARS}. Here, repulsive, attractive, electrostatic as well as interactions extracted from the decoys as the reference state, are considered for structure-based pairwise potential calculation in epitope-MHC molecule docking [27] . Modified PDB ID 4NQX for HLA-A*01:01 is used as allelic protein for docking study of T cell epitope with MHC I restricted. Similarly, 3D structure (PDB ID 1FV1) for HLA-DRB5*01:01 MHC molecule is used as receptor molecule for T cell epitope docking analysis with MHC II restriction.
From InterPro database, 78 homologous protein sequences are recovered for nonstructural protein NS4 protein for coronavirus as shown in Table 1 .

IEDB population coverage tool [23] is used to calculate the population coverage of the predicted epitopes. The result for class I MHC restriction for the China, whole world and Indian population with the selected MHC I alleles is shown in Table 4 .
Predicted T-cell epitopes Interacting MHC-I alleles RTPPTSVVTSGDDGRV 71 reveals that these short stretches of antigenic protein can act as linear B cell epitopes.
The T cell epitope 76 PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG 90 (MHC II restricted) is selected on the basis of its interactions with large number of alleles and lowest IC50 value with HLA-DRB5*01:01 MHC II allele. Similarly, 76 PTDTYTSVY 84 , restricted with MHC I allelic protein HLA-A*01:01 is designated as most probable T cell epitope which is also present in conserved region of non-structural protein NS4 of coronavirus. Docking studies are performed with these two epitopes with human HLA-DRB5*01:01MHC II molecule and MHC I allelic protein HLA-A*01:01 respectively.
Docking study of PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG epitope with HLA-DRB5*01:01, shows lowest binding energy -786.0 Kcal/mole, shown in Figure 4 . Docking structure is stabilized by H bonds, are shown in Table 6 . Interaction between T cell epitope PTDTYTSVY MHC I allelic protein HLA-A*01:01 with binding energy -725.0 Kcal/mole is shown in Figure 5 . 
At present in China and whole world, considering the emergency situation due to corona virus infection, rapid development in vaccine design is the most argent step to prevent pandemics. Because by using vaccine the mortality rate due to coronavirus can be controlled. This technique is applied successfully for smallpox virus, polio virus etc. Though for some other common viruses such as dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and coronavirus, vaccine has not been invented till now. Due to lack of definite information about growth, replication and pathogenesis of these viruses. Therefore, computational techniques are used for epitope mapping, which is the preliminary step for vaccine design to prevent coronavirus infection. This study integrates several immunoinformatics and molecular docking methods to recognize potential epitopes of non-structural protein NS4 in coronavirus.
At first, all seventy-nine non-structural protein 4 from different coronaviruses are retrieved from InterPro database and aligned to detect conserved sequences present in them.

Non-structural protein 4 is considered as our protein of interest for vaccine design assuming its role in viral replication during coronavirus infection and considering its antigenic nature in human. Not only that, this selected protein has structural similarity with non-structural protein 4 present in rat, murine coronavirus containing various strains. Therefore, the proposed peptide-based vaccine might be effective to prevent coronavirus infection not only in human, but also in rat, murine etc. Here, computational method for vaccine design is totally safe, rapid and cost effective at this emergency situation, caused due to coronavirus infection.
Five potent T cell epitope having potentiality for binding with MHC molecules are predicted. For MHC I and MHC II molecules both 9 mer and 15 mer peptide structures are projected from IEDB recommended prediction method and modeled by peptide modeling algorithm. The percentile rank and IC 50 values with SMM/ANN method covering all MHC class I supertypes are also analyzed. The five most effective epitopes are presented in Table 2 along with their IC 50 values.
For MHC I binding prediction scores, the peptide with the lowest percentile rank and IC 50 value, is selected for their highest affinity for that interacting MHC I allele. The T cell epitope 76 PTDTYTSVY 84 is considered on the basis of its interaction with large number of alleles and lowest IC 50 value with HLA-A*01:01 MHC I allele. For this epitope, MHC I processing score with that specific allele comprises proteasome score 1.25, TAP score 1.02, MHC IC 50 value is 6.7 nm. This means that this specific epitope has high affinity to MHC I molecule during antigen presentation. Moreover that, this epitope when interacting with selective MHC I allele shows the highest population coverage not only for Chinese population, but also has higher population coverage compared to other epitopes, for Indian and whole world population. Henceforth, this epitope is considered as epitope of choice for CD8 + T cells.
Likewise, presence of wider peptide binding groove in MHC II molecule than that of MHC I, 15 mer epitopes are investigated by smm/nn/sturnilo method along with their IC 50 values and are listed in Table 3 . For MHC II binding prediction method, a 15 mer T cell epitope sequence 76 PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG 90 of non-structural protein 4, displays a percentile rank 22.0 with IC 50 value 22.0 at the time of interaction with HLA-DRB5*01:01MHC II allele. This result approves that this peptide can be selected as T cell epitope with MHC II restriction for our protein of interest. Moreover, this T cell epitope sequence is well conserved among the nonstructural protein 4 present in different corona viruses.
B cell epitope identification method, the prediction scores for Emini surface accessibility, Parker hydrophilicity, Chou and Fashman beta turn and Karplus and Schulz flexibility for each residue of peptides IRNTTNPSAR, starting from sequence 38 position and ending at 47 position of that viral antigenic protein, predicts that this is the most potent B cell epitope present in it. Additionally, Kolarskar and Tangaonkar antigenicity prediction values, confirm our estimation.
The predicted T cell epitopes are validated by using molecular docking study. These two epitopes are preferably fitted in the epitope binding grooves of the two MHC protein molecules with highly negative binding energies and stabilized by H-bonds. author/funder.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422 doi: bioRxiv preprint An important factor in vaccine design is the distribution of selected HLA allelic protein. This distribution varies among the human population according to the population in different geographic regions of the world. Our predicted T cell epitope, 76 PTDTYTSVY 84 , bound with MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele, which is present among 58.87% and 45.77% of Chinese and Indian populations respectively and 50.16% of world populations. So, it may be concluded that the predicted T cell epitope must be specifically restricted with the predominant MHC molecule, which is present in target population in India and China, as well as in whole world against coronavirus.
Though in general most peptide-based vaccines are developed considering B cell epitopes, in our present study both B cell and T cell epitopes, present in non-structural protein 4, are considered for vaccine design against coronavirus. These two T cell epitopes can stimulate immunogenic response after administration inside the human body. This immunological reaction can prevent coronavirus infection in human as well as rat and murine, when they come in contact with this virus in future. Since these epitopes are well restricted with MHC molecules and at the same time, they are almost conserved among other homologous proteins. These proteins include non-structural protein 4, obtained from novel-coronavirus infected patient in China. Thus, these epitopes can be proceeded for further experimental verification during vaccine designing against coronavirus infection.

1c02f14de3ae4c5e26600b073ec6396caefb3830,,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak occurred during the mass migration period prior to the Chinese New Year in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, a central Chinese hub for transportation and industry. On January 23, a travel ban put the city of Wuhan under quarantine, all transportations into and out of the city were canceled, impacting more than nine million people. It is reported that more than five million people have left Wuhan in the days before the travel ban [1] , which may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 to other provinces in China.
However, the dynamic relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 outbreak in other parts of China remains unclear.
Several analyses have evaluated the impact of migration on the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, Du et al. estimated that COVID-19 may have been transported from Wuhan to more than 130 Chinese cities and all four major metropolitan areas by January 23 [2] . Tian et al. reported that the travel ban slowed the transmission of infection to other Chinese cities by an average of 2.9 days [3] . Chinazzi et al. suggested that the travel ban delayed the overall epidemic progression of COVID-19 in China by 3-5 days, and may reduce the number of cases outside of China by 80% by the end of February [4] . Further, Jin et al. and Chen et al. reported that the cumulative migration from Wuhan was highly correlated with the number of reported cases in other provinces in China, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 [5, 6] .
However, no study to date has estimated the time lag between traffic and disease incidence and the total number of cases prevented by the travel ban.
This analysis aimed to fill in the gap by examining the time-lagged effect between the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan with the COVID-19 incidence in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. We further evaluated the overall intervention effect of the Wuhan travel ban by the end of February. Our study used time-series analysis to estimate the association between travel volume and subsequent COVID-19 incidence, which is less biased as it accounts for the strong autocorrelation within data that are generated from sequential observations.

We collected the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. These reports were obtained from official government websites and state-run media. Data were aggregated by date and province.
Traffic data were collected through the Baidu Migration Map (https://qianxi.baidu.com/), an online interactive map developed by Baidu Inc. to display human migration volume for Chinese cities. The map displays inbound and outbound traffic volumes for selected cities and dates.
Traffic volume is expressed as the Baidu Migration Index, a proprietary index derived based on cell phone positioning data and is proportional to the daily total number of people traveling out of Wuhan. Although the explicit relationship between the population size and the Baidu Migration Index is unclear, previous analysis has estimated that one unit of the index corresponds to approximately 44,520 travelers [4] . Using web scraping technique, we obtained the Baidu Migration Index data for outbound traffic from Wuhan to the 31 Chinese provinces from January 10 to February 29, 2020. We also extracted the percentage of people who traveled to each province from Baidu Migration Map. With these data, we estimated the volume of daily traffic from Wuhan to each province, calculated as Volume province,date = Total Volume date × Percentage province,date . Data for the same Lunar calendar period in 2019 were used as benchmark to make predictions for disease incidence if the travel ban had not been issued.
We included demographic, economic, and geographical factors that are potential contributors to the provincial variation in the association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence.
These factors included geographical distance between Wuhan and each province's capital city, the average daily outbound traffic from Wuhan to each province, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the population density of each province.

We used time series analyses, including cross-correlation function (CCF) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model [8] , to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence. Time series analysis is appropriate because it examines the correlation between two time series data and makes predictions while accounting for any autocorrelation structure within each time series and any shared trends. We used the CCF to understand the time-lagged correlation between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence.
A prewhitening process was applied to the time-series data to avoid common trends between traffic and CVID-19 incidence [9] . The prewhitening was conducted by first fitting an ARIMA model on the x-variable and calculating the residuals, and then filtering the y variable using the x-variable ARIMA model. The CCF assesses the correlation between the residuals from the xvariable ARIMA model and the filtered y values. In our case, the x variable is the daily traffic volume time series and the y variable is the COVID-19 case time series. The non-seasonal ARIMA model is generally denoted as ARIMA ( , , ), in which is the order of the autoregression (AR) component, is the order of the differencing process to form a stationary times series, and is the order of the moving average (MA) process. In an ARIMA model, the value of at time is estimated as:
where is the value at time , is the AR parameter, and is the MA parameter.
Additionally, we evaluated the potential reduction in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in other parts of China following the Wuhan travel ban. To account for the variation in the association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province, we first classified provinces according to their estimated time lag and correlation coefficients using K-means clustering [10] . For each province cluster, we fitted an ARIMA model with traffic volume as an external regressor, also known as an ARIMAX model. The ARIMAX model describes the value of at time using the following equations:

The models were fitted using data up to the expected turning point in COVID-19 incidence following the travel ban. We used the median lag time for each cluster to determine the turning points. We used differencing to stationarize the COVID-19 incidence time series and checked stationarity using the augmented Dickey-Fuller test. The fitted ARIMAX model was used to forecast cumulative incidence till the end of February based on migration data during the same period in 2019. The difference between the predicted and observed cumulative incidence is the estimated intervention effect associated with the travel ban.
Statistical analyses were two-sided with type I error rate of 5%. We used R 3.6.1 for all analyses.
Outbound traffic from Wuhan started to increase rapidly from January 13 and fell sharply after January 23, 2020, when the travel ban was implemented ( Figure 1A-1C) . By January 23, 71% of people who traveled out of Wuhan went to other cities in Hubei province and 29% migrated to other provinces. The incidence of COVID-19 within and outside of Hubei province fluctuated in similar patterns with the change in traffic ( Figure 1E-1G) , suggesting a lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence.
After prewhitening the COVID-19 incidence time series by the ARIMA model fitted on the outbound traffic time series, we calculated the cross-correlation coefficients between daily outbound traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence for each province. There were great geographical variations in time lags and correlation coefficients (Figure 2A-2B) . K-means clustering analysis identified 3 latent clusters of provinces according to time lag and correlation coefficients ( Figure 2C ). The estimated time lags between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence were <1 week in 42% of provinces, 1 week in 39% of provinces, and 2-3 weeks in 19% of provinces.
We examined the potential contributors to provincial variations in the association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence. The analyses showed that the time lags of the migration All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Correlation coefficients were positively associated with geographical distance (β=0.1 per 1000 km, P=0.03; Figure 3E ) and negatively with GDP (β= -0.01 per 1000 USD/person, P=0.02; Figure 3G ). Population density was not associated with either the lag or correlation coefficient.
However, in sensitivity analyses excluding Shanghai from the analysis, whose population density far exceeds all other provinces, population density was negatively associated with the correlation coefficient (β= -0.15 per 1000 persons/sq.km, P=0.03).
The optimal ARIMAX models for each province cluster are summarized in Table 1 . The ARIMA (2,1,0) was optimal for provinces with <1 week of lag, and the ARIMA (1,1,0) was optimal for provinces with ≥1 week of lag. The model-predicted cumulative incidence based on actual traffic data demonstrated good fit with the observed incidences ( Figure 4A -4C, Table 1 ). The predicted cumulative incidences would be higher in all three clusters of provinces based on 2019 traffic data ( Figure 4D-4F) , and the differences were projected to grow larger moving forward. It is estimated that there would be approximately 2,123 more cases in provinces with <1 week lag, 4,363 more in provinces with 1 week of lag, and 13,282 more in provinces with 2-3 weeks of lag by the end of February, although the predicted value was not significantly different from the observed in provinces with <1 week of lag (Table 1) . We estimated that the travel ban may have reduced a total of 19,768 (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) cases outside of Wuhan by the end of February.
In this analysis, we examined the temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces. Our analyses suggest a positive timelagged association between human migration and the incidence of COVID-19. We identified 3 distinct clusters of provinces based on the timing and strength of associations: 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lagged association, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Provinces that are closer to Wuhan and have more passenger influx from Wuhan experienced a more prolonged impact from migration. The correlations between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence were weaker in economically advantaged provinces. Furthermore, we estimated that All rights reserved.

This is equivalent to a 39% reduction in expected cumulative incidence, suggesting that transportation control is an effective intervention to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in the absence of cure and immunization.
Regional variations in the association between outflowing traffic from Wuhan and COVID-19 incidence worth closer examination. Longer time lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence was observed in provinces closer to Wuhan or with more population influx from Wuhan, such as Henan, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Sichuan. Longer lagged effect does not mean these provinces were less responsive to imported cases. Rather, it means the overall changes in cumulative incidence in these provinces were not only driven by imported cases but also infected cases through local transmissions. For example, the lag was estimated to be 23 days for Henan province, which was severely affected by COVID-19. Although Henan province was among the earliest to implement traffic control, the COVID-19 incidences grew steadily after the traffic control. It is possible that the influx of Wuhan emigrants, mostly people who returned home from work/school, led to significant local transmissions in Henan, which outweighed the imported cases in driving the cumulative incidence to grow for a prolonged period. Given the median incubation period of 4-6 days for COVID-19 [11] , the overall COVID-19 incidence in provinces with lags of 2-3 weeks, or approximately 2-3 times the median incubation period, could be reflective of the second-or third-generation transmissions. Also, provinces with longer lag tend to have higher cumulative incidence, suggesting widespread local transmissions.
Another possible reason for the prolonged impact of migration in provinces adjacent to Hubei is that cross-province migrations are hard to shut off given the geographical proximity. Sporadic travelers from Wuhan may continue to cross provincial borders and spread the virus for a while after the travel ban. This is evident by the fact that the lag was much shorter in provinces further away from Wuhan (e.g., Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Hainan, Yunnan) or had more strict traffic control (e.g., Beijing). Furthermore, travelers to these provinces were more likely to be tourists as opposed to returning home; therefore, they have little social ties to the local population and are less likely to introduce widespread local transmissions.
In addition, we found that the correlation between migration and COVID-19 incidence was lower in provinces with higher GDP per capita. For example, the correlation coefficients were between All rights reserved.

In contrast, the correlation coefficients were between 0.5-0.7 for Gansu, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Shanxi, provinces with GDP per capita below $7000 US dollars. The finding suggests that provinces with better healthcare resources, greater disease prevention efforts, and more mature infrastructure may have more capacity to manage disease outbreaks and maintain faster responses as the outbreak evolve.
The primary strength of this analysis is the use of ARIMA models to examine the temporal relationship between traffic and COVID-19 incidence, allowing us to disentangle the association from a myriad of shared common trends between the two variables. The analysis is also novel in that real-time, cellphone location-based migration data were used to measure population mobility, which is superior to methods based on historical mobility data. This analysis also fitted separate ARIMA models according to differing time-lagged impacts from traffic, leading to a more accurate estimate of the intervention effect for the travel ban.
This analysis is subject to limitations. First, changes in diagnostic capacity and criteria for COVID-19 may have contributed to, at least partly, the secular trend of COVID-19 incidence.
For example, there were underdiagnoses of COVID-19 during the early stage of the outbreak, and later a surge in COVID-19 cases around February 13 due to broadened diagnostic criteria.
These changes were not travel-related and may distort the estimated association to some extent. Second, the temporal association between traffic and COVID-19 could be confounded by other preventive measures, such as increased self-quarantine and widespread use of face mask and hand sanitization. Therefore, the estimated intervention effect associated with the travel ban could be overestimated. Finally, as an ecologic study, our findings may suffer from ecologic fallacy and do not necessarily imply individual-level association between travel history and risk of COVID-19 infection.
In conclusion, mass migration out of Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 outbreak in other parts of China. The outflowing migration from Wuhan had a more prolonged impact on provinces that are closer to Wuhan and have more immigration from Wuhan. Provinces with higher GDP per capita were less impacted by migration. It is estimated that approximately 39% of cases outside of Wuhan have been prevented by the travel ban issued on January 23, 2020. In the absence of cures and immunization for an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19, transportation control, an old-fashioned approach, is proven an effective public health intervention.

1c06378f629bfa8870c89b3abfdecfc19db9b459,"Artificial nanoparticles accumulate a protein corona layer in biological fluids, which significantly influences their bioactivity. As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ42), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, in-vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies. doi: bioRxiv preprint HSV-1 is an example of another virus with high prevalence, infecting nearly 70% of the human population 17 .

Latent HSV-1 is occasionally reactivated causing peripheral pathology and under certain circumstances it can migrate into the central nervous system causing herpes simplex encephalitis; the most common cause of sporadic fatal viral encephalitis 19 . In the context of the current work we focused on the presumptive role of HSV-1 in the pathology of AD. A number of risk factors have been associated with AD, including the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), diabetes, vascular pathology, neuroinflammation and infections 20 . Several recent studies have supported the theory of a significant role of HSV-1 in the disease 21 . HSV-1 DNA was found to be localized within amyloid plaques in AD patients and HSV-1 infection has been shown to promote neurotoxic Aβ accumulation in human neural cells and to the formation of Aβ deposits in the brains of infected mice 22,23 . Moreover, the presence of anti-HSV IgM antibodies, which indicate HSV reactivation, is correlated with a high risk of AD and antiherpetic treatment is correlated with a reduced risk of developing dementia 24,25 . Despite these correlations, the mechanism by which viruses induce amyloid aggregation, the major pathological hallmark of AD, is not known.
In the present study, we demonstrated that upon encountering different biological fluids, RSV accumulated extensive and distinct protein coronae compared to HSV-1 and synthetic liposomes. The various coronae were dependent on the biological fluid and exerted markedly different effects on RSV infectivity and capacity to activate monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). Moreover, upon interaction with an amyloidogenic peptide derived from IAPP, RSV accelerated the process of amyloid aggregation via surface-assisted heterogenous nucleation.
This amyloid catalysis was also demonstrated for HSV-1 and the Aβ42 peptide in-vitro and in an AD animal model.
Our findings highlight the importance of viral protein corona interactions for viral pathogenesis and provide a direct mechanistic link between viral and amyloid pathologies.
Results
Based on the extensive literature describing the significant role of corona factors in synthetic nanoparticle functionality, we used established techniques to answer questions regarding RSV pathogenicity 26 . Using proteomics, we assessed the RSV protein corona profiles in adult human plasma (HP), juvenile (6 months old infants tested RSV negative at the time of sample collection) human plasma (jHP), human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from healthy adults, rhesus macaque plasma (MP), and fetal bovine serum (FBS). These biological fluids represent different microenvironments encountered by the virus in terms of tissue tropism (HP vs. BALF), zoonosis (MP) and culturing conditions (FBS). The biological fluids were screened for antibodies against RSV using ELISA, and both adult HP and BALF contained high levels of anti-RSV IgG antibodies, unlike jHP, MP and FBS (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Viral stocks were produced in serum-free conditions to prevent initial contamination with FBS proteins. Virions produced under serum-free conditions were incubated with 10% v/v solutions of different biological fluids.
Controls included non-infected cell medium representing the background cellular secretome, and synthetic lipid vesicles of a size comparable to RSV (200 nm) with positively or negatively charged surfaces. In addition, we compared the coronae of RSV to HSV-1 to probe for differences between different viruses of relatively similar size. After incubation for 1 h at 37 ˚C, the virions were re-harvested by centrifugation and washed twice before performing mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses.
Six replicates from two independent experiments. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 software.
The detection of specific anti-RSV IgG antibodies in biological fluids was performed using Human Anti-Respiratory syncytial virus IgG ELISA Kit (ab108765, abcam®, Sweden), according to manufacturer's protocol.
All biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml before performing the assay and results were compared to the positive, cutoff, and negative controls provided by the kit manufacturer.
HEp-2 cells were seeded in maintenance medium until they reached 50-60% confluency. On the day of infection, the cells were washed twice with warm PBS and medium was changed to VP-SFM with gentamycin. Before adding to the cells, sucrose cushion-concentrated RSV stocks were pre-incubated with different biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) at a final protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in VP-SFM with 10 mM sodium citrate for 1 h at 37 ˚C. The corona-precoated viruses were then added to the cells in serum-free conditions (diluted 10x) at a MOI of 1. 24h post-infection, the medium was changed back to growth medium and cells were visualized with fluorescence microscopy 72h post-infection. After visualization, the cells were washed and stained with LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Far Red Dead Cell Stain Kit (ThermoFisher, USA) for 30 min at 4 ˚C in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS no calcium, no magnesium, ThermoFisher), then fixed and washed for flow cytometry using Cytofix/Cytoperm™ (BD, USA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then scraped and resuspended in DPBS, and the data was acquired using MACSQuant® Analyser 10 flowcytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, Sweden). The data was analyzed by FlowJo software (TreeStar) by excluding the dead cells stained with far-red fluorescent dye and subsequent calculation of GFP positive cells within the viable cell population. For experiments with palivizumab, cells were treated with different concentrations of the antibody before infection.
Human monocytes were negatively selected from buffy coats using the RosetteSep Monocyte Enrichment Kit (1mL/10mL buffy coat; StemCell Technologies) and differentiated into moDC, using GM-CSF (250ng/mL; PeproTech) and IL-4 (6.5ng/mL; R&D Systems) for 6 days in 37°C, 5% CO2 at a density of 5x10 5 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 completed with 10% FCS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% and penicillin/streptomycin (ThermoFisher, USA). Immature moDC were exposed to RSV pre-incubated with different biological fluids for 4h in serum free media, washed and then incubated in serum containing medium for 72 h before analyses of CD86 and RSV-GFP expression. Dead cells were excluded using Live/Dead fixable near-IR dead cell stain kit (ThermoFisher). Flow cytometry sample data were acquired on a Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and the analysis was performed in FlowJo software (TreeStar).
NNFGAIL, GNNQQNY, Aβ42, Aβ40 were synthesized and purified by Pepscan (The Netherlands) and the final molecular weight was verified by MS. 10 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (ThermoFisher, USA) were added to .","The term ""protein corona"" refers to the layer of proteins that adhere to the surfaces of nanostructures when they encounter biological fluids. Nanoparticles adsorb biomolecules in biological fluids due to the high free energy of their surfaces 1 . The importance of the corona layer stems from the fact that it constitutes the actual surface of interaction with biological membranes or ""what the cell sees"" in the in-vivo context 2 . Hundreds of proteins have been identified to confer a distinct biological identity of nanoparticles in different microenvironments depending on their size, chemistry and surface modification (recently reviewed in 3 ). These factors were found to be critical determinants of the biodistribution and pharmacodynamics of nanoparticles. On the other hand, the ability of the surfaces of nanoparticles to partially denature certain corona proteins exposing ""cryptic epitopes"" highlights the role of the protein corona in the toxicology of nanoparticles [4] [5] [6] . The formation of a protein corona is particularly important in the context of nanoparticle interaction with amyloidogenic peptides such as amyloid beta (Aβ42) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which are associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 disease, respectively. Nanoparticles have been shown to catalyze amyloid formation via binding of amyloidogenic peptides in their corona, thereby increasing local peptide concentration and inducing conformational changes that facilitate fibril growth via a heterogenous nucleation mechanism 7, 8 . This surface-assisted (heterogenous) nucleation has been demonstrated for several nanoparticles with different amyloidogenic peptides including IAPP and Aβ42 9,10 .
Here, we studied viruses in terms of their biophysical equivalence to synthetic nanoparticles in extracellular environments. As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses lack any metabolic activity outside the cell, and can thus be expected to interact with host factors in the microenvironment similar to artificial nanoparticles.
In the current work, we used well-established techniques of nanotechnology to study the protein corona of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in comparison to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and synthetic liposomes.
Additionally, we studied the interaction of both RSV and HSV-1 with amyloidogenic peptides.
RSV is an enveloped Orthopneumovirus with a diameter between 100 and 300 nm and a single stranded negativesense RNA genome with 10 genes encoding 11 proteins 11 . It is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children worldwide, causing up to an annual estimate of 34 million cases 12 . By the second year of life, nearly 90% of children get infected with RSV causing up to 196,000 yearly fatalities 13 . Reinfection with RSV occurs throughout life, usually with mild local symptoms in the upper airways 14 . However, reinfection in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals can lead to severe clinical disease in the lower airways. While natural infection leads to the production of neutralizing antibodies, the ability of these antibodies to protect from subsequent RSV infections appears to be incomplete 15, 16 . Neither a vaccine nor an antiviral therapy is yet available except for passive immunization using the anti-RSV monoclonal antibody palivizumab. Early vaccine trials using formalin-inactivated RSV led to enhanced disease with up to 80% of vaccinees being hospitalized and two dying following natural RSV infection 14, 16 . This led to the hypothesis that host immune responses play an important role in the pathophysiology of airway disease caused by RSV.
Assessment of the proteomic data by principle component analysis (PCA) showed that RSV and HSV-1 samples were well separated from one another and that the viral samples were well separated from the control samples with the replicates clustering together ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Replicate clustering was confirmed via corresponding correlation plots for the samples in the PCA, which showed higher correlation coefficients between the replicates within the same corona condition than between different conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . Notably, both RSV and HSV-1 possessed distinctive proteomic profiles depending on the biological fluid ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2c ). In addition, RSV protein corona profiles were different between HP and jHP ( Supplementary Fig. 2d) ; however, the use of a different mass spectrometer for this experiment prevents direct comparison to the data shown in Fig. 1 . The reproducibility of the corona preparations was further assessed by calculating coefficient of variation (CV) between the replicates for each sample type. The CVs ranged between 16 -42% depending on sample type (average 28%, Supplementary Fig. 3d) .
In order to determine if the most abundant corona factors were the most abundant proteins in the biological fluids, the crude fluids were also analyzed by mass spectrometry. The top 10 most abundant proteins identified are presented in Table 1 . Similar to previous findings for nanoparticles 27 , our data showed that the most abundant proteins in the protein corona were not necessarily the most abundant in the biological fluids. This, together with the PCA analyses comparing RSV to HSV-1 and the controls indicated enrichment of particular corona factors depending on the surface properties of the virus. Moreover, proteomic data sets were visualized by heat map and hierarchical clustering revealing an extensive protein corona signature for viral samples in each biological fluid ( Fig. 1d) . While the serum-free viral particles contained some host factors that were incorporated during virus replication and budding from the cells, the virus was able to subsequently accumulate a different set of host factors which were dependent on the biological fluid. As such, a characteristic viral biological identity was associated with each biological fluid. The viral corona factors present on all three replicates in each biological fluid are listed in Supplementary Data 1. In addition, the raw proteomics data are available in Supplementary Data 2.
Additionally, we used transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the viral protein corona. A layer of factors was observed interacting with the viral surface upon encounter with cell membranes, which was absent in serum free conditions (Fig. 2a) . This demonstrated that RSV accumulated a layer of corona factors that are likely involved in cellular interactions. We also performed cryoimmuno electron microscopy using antibodies for certain proteins that were detected in the viral corona proteomic analysis. In serum-free conditions, we used an anti-RSV F-protein antibody. For adult HP and BALF coronae, we used anti-human IgG and anti-surfactant protein A (SP-A) antibodies, respectively. The bound antibodies were detected using secondary antibodies coated with 10 nm gold nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 2b , corona factors were bound to the surface of RSV and labelled with the respective antibodies. To further confirm the binding of these factors, we performed western blot analysis on viral particles incubated with either HP or BALF. Several bands were detected for SP-A in the BALF corona samples and were completely lacking in the HP corona samples ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). In addition to the main SP-A bands, several high molecular weight bands were also detected with the anti-SP-A antibody. This suggested that SP-A was forming complexes either on its own or with other corona factors. When stained with anti-human IgG antibodies, bands were detected in both coronae, but with higher intensity in the HP corona compared to the BALF corona ( Supplementary Fig. 4b) . The bands were normalized to the RSV G protein band which was used as a 6 loading control ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Taken together, our data demonstrated that RSV acquired a differential protein corona layer depending on the biological fluid.
To investigate if differential corona composition affects viral infectivity, virions produced under serum-free conditions were pre-incubated with different biological fluids before infection of HEp-2cells. The RSV-GFP virions were incubated with biological fluids at a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml (equivalent to 5% v/v) for 1 h at 37 ˚C then diluted 10 times in serum-free medium before infecting the cells at final MOI of 1. Corona precoating had a significant effect on viral infectivity as demonstrated by the differential frequency of GFP expressing cells quantified by flow cytometry (Fig. 3a-b and Supplementary Fig 5) . HP corona pre-coating significantly reduced infectivity compared to serum-free conditions, while FBS and MP led to 5-6 fold enhancement in infectivity. The BALF corona also enhanced infectivity, but to a lower extent as compared to MP and FBS.
Moreover, fluorescence microscopy revealed syncytia formation of cells infected with BALF, MP and FBS coronae ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). No significant differences in cell-toxicity were observed. jHP pre-coating, on the other hand, slightly enhanced infectivity, but it did not reach significance (Fig. 3b ). This lack of inhibition compared to adult HP could be attributed to the lack of anti-RSV antibodies in the selected jHP ( Supplementary   Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of different coronae on the activation of human moDCs by quantifying the expression of the maturation marker CD86. Differentiated moDCs were infected by virions produced under serum-free conditions with different corona pre-coatings for 4h in serum-free conditions. The cells were then washed and incubated in serum-containing medium for 72 h prior to flow cytometry analyses. Only the BALF pre-coated virions were able to induce moDC activation and increase CD86 expression ( Fig. 3c-f) . Notably, adding BALF alone or corona-free RSV did not activate the cells, showing that it was the RSV-BALF corona complex that induced moDC activation. In addition, BALF pre-coating enhanced infectivity in moDCs as quantified by flow cytometry of GFP expression ( Fig. 3e-f ). Altogether, this shows that pre-incubation of virions produced under serum-free conditions in different biological fluids to allow a corona formation greatly affects infectivity and the ability to induce moDC activation in a biological fluid-dependent manner.
The set of factors that were only present in the HP corona and not in the other conditions comprised several antibodies and complement factors (Fig. 4a) . Moreover, gene list enrichment analyses of HP corona revealed an enrichment of immunological gene ontology (GO) terms such as complement activation and humoral immune response (Fig. 4b) . The HP corona proteomic profile was consistent with the observed inhibition of infectivity (neutralization), indicating that the corona characterization methodology is representative of the actual layer of host factors that surrounds the viral particle. Notably, despite having comparably high levels of virus-specific IgG antibodies, BALF imparted opposite effects on infectivity compared to HP (Fig. 3) . At the proteomics level, GO analysis revealed that the viral BALF corona comprised a different set of factors that are less enriched in immunological components and more enriched in factors related to adhesion, anchoring, protein targeting to membrane, interspecies interaction, mutualism through parasitism, protein complex binding, and macromolecular complex binding (Fig.4) . This was further supported by the western blot analysis where the corona of the BALF incubated virions was less enriched in human IgG compared to the viral HP corona ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . and MP on viral neutralization via palivizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F protein of RSV. We found that the enhancing effects of the coronae were completely lost in the presence of the antibody and that the antibody neutralization curves were very simillar in the presence and the absence of the viral corona (Fig. 5b) . These data demostrated that high affinity antibodies were able to compete out corona factors to impart host protection. GO analysis revealed that FBS and MP coronae were also enriched in terms such as anchoring, adhesion, receptor binding, protein complex binding, unfolded protein binding, interspecies interaction, viral process, and mutualism through parasitism ( Fig. 5c-d) .
Since nanoparticles are known to bind amyloidogenic peptides in their coronae leading to induction of amyloid aggregation via a heterogenous nucleation mechanism, we next investigated whether viruses are also capable of this particular corona interaction. We investigated the interaction of RSV with a model amyloidogenic peptide (NNFGAIL) derived from the IAPP. We traced the ability of RSV to accelerate amyloid kinetics using the wellestablished thioflavin T (ThT) based methodology. The ThT dye changes its fluorescence emission spectrum upon binding to amyloid fibrils, and plotting relative changes in the fluorescence intensity against time illustrates the kinetics of the amyloid formation process 28 . Using the ThT assay, we found that the presence of RSV particles significantly accelerated amyloid formation of NNFGAIL compared to non-infected cell supernatant demonstrating that RSV acted as a catalytic surface for amyloid aggregation (Fig. 6a) . As a control, we compared the kinetic curves of the virus-containing medium vs. virus-free medium upon incubation with ThT alone without a peptide. As shown in Supplementary Fig 7a, the curves were very similar, indicating that the relative changes that we observed in the presence of amyloidogenic peptides are not due to unspecific interaction of the virions with the ThT dye. Additionally, extensive fiber networks were observed with TEM within 100 min. of incubation with RSV ( Fig. 6b ) and some virions were located at the tip of these fibers (Fig. 6c) . Moreover, RSV catalytic activity was more efficient than lipid vesicles of similar size; however, it was dramatically reduced in the presence of 5% FBS, indicating a competition between the peptide and other corona factors for the viral surface (Fig. 6d) .
On the other hand, RSV failed to catalyze the amyloid aggregation of GNNQQNY peptide, which is derived from yeast prion protein (Fig. 6e) . This, in turn, indicated that such interactions are not universal to all amyloidogenic peptides but display some selectivity depending on the virus/peptide pair.
The finding that viral surfaces could serve as catalysts for amyloid formation warranted further investigation and confirmation using another virus/peptide system. To this end, we investigated HSV-1 and the Aβ42 peptide, whose aggregation is a major hallmark of AD. Recently, there has been an increasing body of reports suggestive of a correlation between HSV-1 infection and AD, reviewed in 21 . However, evidence of a direct role of HSV-1 in the process of amyloid nucleation and subsequent fibril growth is currently lacking.

We found that HSV-1 significantly accelerated amyloid formation of Aβ42 compared to non-infected cell supernatant (Fig. 7a) . As a control, and similar to the RSV/NNFGAIL system, both the virus-containing medium and virus-free medium produced similar curves upon incubation with ThT alone without peptide ( Supplementary   Fig. 7b ). The catalytic activity was reduced by the presence of FBS, also indicating a competition at the viral surface (Fig 7b) . In addition, HSV-1 was more efficient than liposomes in accelerating the amyloid aggregation kinetics (Fig. 7c) . Furthermore, the propensity of HSV-1 mediated amyloid catalysis was higher for the more amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptide compared to the shorter, less amyloidogenic Aβ40 peptide (Fig. 7d) . Amyloid induction was further confirmed by TEM demonstrating fibril formation within 100 min. of incubation with viral particles (Fig. 7e-h) . Amyloid protofilaments and fibrils at different stages of elongation were observed interacting with the viral surface. Fig. 7e and f show multiple fibrillary structures emerging from one viral particle suggesting that a nucleation mechanism was taking place on the surface, thereby sparking fibril elongation. Viral particles also interacted with fibrillar structures that are part of an extensive network of fibers as shown in Fig. 7g and h.
Importantly, to demonstrate the in-vivo relevance of our mechanistic findings, we intracranially infected transgenic 5XFAD mice with HSV-1. The 5XFAD mouse is a widely-used AD model as it recapitulates many AD phenotypes with rapid onset of Aβ42 aggregation that spreads to the hippocampus and cortex by six months of age 29 . We observed a significant increase in Aβ42 accumulation in the hippocampi and cortices of HSV-1 infected mice 48h post infection (Fig. 7i ) in comparison with animals injected with non-infected supernatant. Representative images of the amyloid staining demonstrate the dramatic difference in amyloid accumulation between infected and noninfected animals (Fig. 7j) . These results validated our biophysical findings using the ThT assay and demonstrated that the viral corona-driven catalysis of amyloid aggregation could take place in in-vivo situations.
Viruses rely on the cellular machinery of the host for replication, production of viral proteins, assembly and export out of the cell. However, outside cells, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles.
Based on this biophysical equivalence, we hypothesized that viruses accumulate a rich and selective protein corona layer in the extracellular environment similar to nanoparticles. Examples of particular host factors that bind to viral surfaces have previously been described. For example, lipoproteins such as apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) were shown to be essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 30 . Furthermore, coagulation factors such as factor X were shown to directly bind adenovirus leading to liver tropism 31, 32 . Other soluble components such as Gas6 were shown to contribute to the infectivity of lentiviral vectors even when pseudotyped with multiple types of envelope proteins 33 . Furthermore, soluble heparin sulfonated proteoglycans (HSPGs) were shown to enhance the infectivity of human papillomavirus (HPV) 34 . Interestingly, amyloids derived from prostatic acidic phosphatase (PAP) in semen were shown to enhance HIV-1 infectivity by several orders of magnitude 35 . Additionally, plant viral nanoparticles that are used for drug delivery were shown to possess a protein corona that affects their uptake and biodistribution 36 . However, to our knowledge, there is no previous work that has characterized the protein corona of an infectious animal virus in different biological fluids and studied its effect on viral pathogenicity.
In this work, we used proteomics to study viral protein corona enrichment in different biological fluids. We investigated the RSV protein coronae in biological fluids that are relevant to viral tropism, zoonosis and culturing conditions. As RSV is a virus tropic to the respiratory tract, we compared the viral corona in human BALF versus HP from adult healthy volunteers and jHP from RSV-seronegative 6-month-old infants. We also investigated the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Moreover, we studied the corona in FBS, which is the most commonly used cell growth supplement for viral production and in-vitro studies. We compared the RSV corona to HSV-1 and lipid vesicles of similar size with positively or negatively charged surfaces as well as the biological fluids per se. PCA, quantitative intrasample variability analysis and correlation matrices demonstrated that the RSV corona profiles were well separated from that of HSV-1 and lipid vesicles (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3 ). Intra-sample variability could arise in the process of sample preparation during incubation, washing and digestion or during mass spectroscopy-based detection 38 . Notably, while the viral corona profile was dependent on the biological fluid, it was not a mere reflection of the most abundant proteins, as demonstrated earlier for nanoparticles 27 and as shown in the Table 1 of the top 10 proteins present in the viral coronae in comparison to crude biological fluids. The viral protein corona was visualized using TEM, which revealed a layer surrounding the viral surface involved in cellular interactions ( Fig. 2a) . Using cryoimmuno electron microscopy and western blot, we could detect specific proteins identified from the proteomic analysis (human IgG in HP and SP-A in BALF) associated with RSV upon incubation with HP or BALF, respectively ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4) . Functionally, the coronae from the different biological fluids enhanced RSV infectivity except for the HP corona, which completely neutralized the virus (Fig.   3 ). Taken together, using several complementary methods, our data demonstrated the specific enrichment of differential corona profiles on viral surfaces. As such, the protein corona represents an initial phase of viral-host interactions that precedes cellular interaction and affects subsequent infectivity. Unlike the viral genome-coded surface proteins, the viral protein corona is an acquired structural layer that is dependent on the viral microenvironment resulting in different viral identities based on the target tissue and the target organism.
Moreover, as the corona layer is a rich and complex layer, the final biological effect is expected to be dependent on a multitude of corona factors rather than a single protein.
Proteomic analysis of the HP corona revealed that it was enriched in antibodies and complement factors, which could explain the neutralization effect ( Fig. 3 and 4) . Other factors of documented immunological functions such as fibrinogen 39 , properdin 40 , annexin A1 41 , protein S100 42 and vimentin 43 were also detected in the HP corona (Supplementary Data 1). These factors could be parts of an immunological corona that enables efficient viral neutralization and/or immune system modulation. On the other hand, jHP, which lacked the anti-RSV antibodies, failed to neutralize the virus and the jHP corona was less enriched in immunological factors compared to the HP corona (Table. 1 and Fig. 3) . Interestingly, the BALF corona enhanced viral infectivity in both HEp-2 cells and moDCs despite having equally high anti-RSV IgG antibody titers as compared to HP according to ELISA analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The proteomic and GO analysis showed that the BALF corona was less enriched in immunological factors (Fig. 4) . Additionally, less IgG was detected in the BALF corona in the western blot analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . The failure of BALF to neutralize the virus despite being rich in anti-RSV antibodies suggested that the differential protein corona profile could affect antibody binding in BALF conditions. This might explain the recurrence of pulmonary RSV infection even in individuals with high IgG titers 15 . An alternative explanation is that the BALF anti-RSV antibodies are of lower affinity than their HP counterparts and are thus less able to compete out other corona factors that enhance viral infectivity. It remains to be elucidated, which avidity is required in order to compete out the corona layer. The list of proteins that were uniquely detected in the BALF corona included pulmonary surfactants which are known to enhance RSV infectivity 44 , nucleolin and EGFR, which were shown to be important for RSV cell entry 45, 46 , adhesion molecules (such as tetraspanin, .

Notably, pre-incubation of RSV with BALF was the only condition that induced moDC activation (Fig. 3) . Importantly, it was not the combination of the proteins in the biological fluids or the virus per se that affected the outcome, but rather the viral-corona complex, as shown by the lack of moDC activation by BALF or RSV alone. Moreover, and in accordance with the documented role of corona factors in nanoparticle immunogenicity 47 , our results demonstrated the role of the acquired corona layer in virus-induced immune activation that might contribute to disease pathophysiology. It can be speculated that the viral corona factors are part of the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), which are recognized by the innate immune system. It also suggests that corona factors need to be considered in the design of vaccines and adjuvants for efficient stimulation of the immune system.
Additional biological fluids investigated in our study included FBS and MP and they both enhanced the infectivity of RSV in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 5a) . Artificially adding anti-RSV antibodies (palivizumab) successfully neutralized the virus even in these corona conditions, indicating successful out-competition by the antibody (Fig. 5b) . GO analysis suggested a role of FBS and MP corona factors in interspecies interaction, mutualism, viral process, protein complex binding, unfolded protein binding, anchoring and adhesion (Fig. 5 c-d) .
Factors uniquely present in the FBS corona that may contribute to these effects include C4b-binding protein alphalike which is a complement inhibitor, isoform 2 of fermitin family homolog 2 which binds to membranes enriched in phosphoinositides and enhances integrin-mediated adhesion 48 and hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (Fig. 5c ).
In the MP corona, several adhesion proteins were found including: fibronectin isoform 4 preproprotein, endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule, fermitin family homolog 3 short form and zyxin. The MP corona also contained receptor ligands such as: transferrin and C-X-C motif chemokine together with tetherin (isoform 2 of Bone marrow stromal antigen 2), which possesses antiviral properties 49 . Taken together, this illustrated that the observed functional effects of the viral protein corona were most likely mediated by a combination of factors that are enriched on the viral surface and not by a single factor. Since many viruses bind to several receptors and coreceptors, such interactions might be taking place in a multivalent manner 50 . In addition, our results also highlight that the viral protein corona has to be taken into consideration in relation to zoonosis and applications involving viral propagation in-vitro.
We then investigated whether viral corona interactions with host factors involve surface-assisted nucleation of amyloids. Nanoparticles have been shown to act as catalytic surfaces that facilitate heterogenous nucleation of amyloid fibrils via binding, concentrating and enabling conformational changes of amyloidogenic peptides 7, 51, 52 .
Similar to what have been reported with nanoparticles, we found that RSV accelerated the kinetics of amyloid aggregation of a model amyloidogenic peptide derived from IAPP (NNFGAIL). This demonstrated that viral particles are also capable of amyloid catalysis via surface-assisted heterogenous nucleation (Fig. 6) . In order to investigate if this catalytic mechanism extends to other virus-amyloid pairs, we evaluated whether HSV-1 could accelerate the amyloid kinetics of Aβ42, which is implicated in AD. Several recent studies have suggested HSV-1 involvement in AD 53 . Herein, we found that HSV-1 accelerated the kinetics of amyloid aggregation of Aβ42 and to a lesser extent the aggregation of Aβ40 (Fig. 7) . HSV-1 was more efficient than lipid vesicles in amyloid catalysis The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/246785 doi: bioRxiv preprint maturation and the viral surface via early protofibrillar intermediates, which we speculate represent the surfaceassisted nucleation process. Importantly, infecting 5XFAD AD animal models with HSV-1 lead to increased accumulation of Aβ42 plaques as evident by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 7) , demonstrating that the viral corona-driven catalysis can take place in-vivo.
Taken together, our data on RSV and HSV-1 demonstrated that viruses can physically act as nano-surfaces capable of catalyzing amyloid nucleation and leading to accelerated fibril formation. While our results do not prove disease causality, they present mechanistic explanation of the clinical and experimental correlations drawn between HSV-1 and AD, which requires further investigation. Interestingly, Apo-E, which is a well-known risk factor for AD, was enriched in the HSV-1 corona, suggesting even further disease links (Supplementary Data 1) .
Several recent studies have suggested that Aβ42 is an antimicrobial peptide that aggregates to sequester pathogens [54] [55] [56] [57] . Here, we present an alternative but not mutually exclusive explanation. Our corona-driven hypothesis suggests that the virus interacts with extracellular amyloidogenic peptides as part of the pathogenesis, and the bound peptides do not necessarily possess an immunological and/or an antimicrobial function. This is further corroborated by studies showing that amyloids can enhance the infectivity for viruses such as HIV and HSV 35, 58 , and the fact that amyloid precursor protein (APP) knock-out animals are not more susceptible for infections compared to wild-type animals 59 . From this perspective, virus surface-assisted nucleation might have evolved as a mechanism by which viruses modulate the host's extracellular environment by catalyzing the phase transition of certain peptides from soluble to insoluble forms; a phase change that could lead to toxic gain or loss of function or both. In addition, the viral surface-assisted nucleation mechanism could be extended to other viruses correlated with neurodegenerative pathology such as HIV and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) 60 and influenza virus and post-encephalitic parkinsonism 61 To conclude, the current work was based on the biophysical equivalence between viruses and artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments. We here demonstrated that nanotechnological concepts such as the protein corona and surface-assisted nucleation can be extended to infectious viruses. We showed that viral protein corona accumulation and amyloid catalysis are two aspects of the same phenomenon, namely viral surface interaction with extracellular host proteins. This phenomenon leads to the modulation of how viruses interact with cells and/or the induction of conformational changes in bound proteins that leads to accelerated amyloid aggregation. These findings highlight the potentially critical role of viral extracellular interactions in viral infectivity and in relation to extracellular protein pathology.

HEp-2 cells, a human laryngeal carcinoma cell line, were used for RSV culture and infectivity experiments.
Preparation of RSV A2-GFP stocks was performed using VP-SFM serum-free, ultra-low protein medium containing no proteins, peptides, or other components of animal or human origin (ThermoFisher, USA). HEp-2 cells were initially seeded in growth medium (DMEM medium with 5% FBS ( MOIs used for infectivity experiments were based on genome copies/ml measured by qPCR and the infectious viral titers were measured as TCID50 on HEp-2 cells. Briefly, 10-fold dilutions of virus were added onto Hep2 cells for 2 h at 37°C, then inoculum was removed, and fresh maintenance medium was added. The plates were examined in the microscope on day7 and the number of wells for each dilution that was positive for GFP was noted. The titer was calculated according to the method of Karber. The viral stock of 7x10 8 genome copies/ml corresponded to log10 6.7 TCID50/mL. For HSV-1, strain F HSV-1 stocks were prepared by infecting African green monkey kidney (VERO) cells at 80-90% confluency in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 5% FBS or in serum-free DMEM. The virus was harvested 2 d after infection. Cells were subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles and spun at 20,000 g for 10 min to remove cell debris.
Clarified supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80°C until use. Non-infected cell medium was prepared with the same procedure without viral infection. Plaque assay was used to determine viral titers. 10-fold dilutions of virus were added onto VERO cells for 1 h at 37°C, then inoculum was removed, and fresh medium containing 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma Aldrich) was added. Cells were fixed and stained 2d later with a 0.1% crystal violet solution and the number of plaques was counted.

Samples were applied to Formvar/carbon coated 200 mesh nickel grids (Agar Scientific, UK), then negatively stained using an aqueous solution of uranyl acetate (1%) and visualized.
Serum-free produced RSV was incubated with BALF or HP both at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml at a ratio of 1:1 v/v (in citrate adjusted conditions to prevent coagulation) for 1h at 37 ℃, then harvested and washed similar to the procedure for corona proteomic analysis. Samples were lysed using a RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and protein content was measured. Samples were heated with loading buffer to 95˚C for 5 min and 1 µg of protein was loaded onto NuPAGE® Bis-Tris 4-12% gels then separated at 80 V for 15 min followed by 100V
for 135 min at room temperature using 1x NuPAGE® MES SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). The gels were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the IBlot® system (Invitrogen) and subsequently the membranes were blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences GmbH) for 1.5 h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 ℃ with anti-Surfactant Protein A antibody [6F10] (ab51891, abcam) diluted at 1:500 then probed the next day using goat anti-human IgG (IRDye 800, red, LI-COR Biosciences) and goat anti-mouse IgG (IRDye 680, green, LI-COR Biosciences). To normalize the bands to a loading control, scanned membranes were stripped for 10 min at 65 ˚C using 1x New Blot Nitro Stripping buffer (LI-COR Biosciences), blocked for 1.5 h, and then incubated with anti-respiratory syncytial virus antibody (ab20745, abcam) 65 at 1:500 dilution for 2h at RT before probing with secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat, IRDye 680, green, LI-COR Biosciences). All western blot signals were scanned using the Odyssey Imager (LI-COR Biosciences GmbH) and quantification was performed on the images using ImageJ software.
To evaluate the impact of the HSV-1 on brain β-amyloid (Aβ) levels, 3-month-old transgenic 5XFAD mice (purchased from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine, US) were randomly divided into 2 groups. The animals were injected either with the HSV virus or non-infected supernatant using a micro-infusion pump (The Harvard Apparatus Pump Series, Harvard Bioscience, USA) into the right lateral ventricles. Briefly, surgical anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane and maintained with 1.8% isoflurane (in 30% O2/70% N2O). The temperature of the animals was maintained at 37 +/-0.5 °C using a thermostatically controlled heating blanket connected to a rectal probe (PanLab, Harvard Apparatus, Barcelona, Spain). The skin was opened and the scull exposed.

1c0b25c8e3c89243fd8797e2e964e12689bc8556,"As the predominant etiological agent of the common cold, human rhinovirus (HRV) is 19 the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early studies showed monovalent formalin-20 inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated 21 with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine 22 efforts. We approached this problem straightforwardly. We tested the hypothesis that increasing 23 virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses. Here, 24 we show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, 25 inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice 26 and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient 27 quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the 28 response. We for the first time generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to 29 numerous and diverse HRV types.
30 31 38","HRV causes respiratory illness in billions of people annually, a socioeconomic burden 1 . 33 HRV also causes pneumonia hospitalizations in children and adults and exacerbations of asthma 34 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 2 . HRV was found to be the second leading 35 cause of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in US children, second only 36 to respiratory syncytial virus, and the most common pathogen associated with pneumonia 37 hospitalization in US adults 3,4 . A vaccine for HRV could alleviate serious disease in asthma and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) as a correlate of protection, and estimated duration of 41 immunity 5-11 . Trials with monovalent HRV vaccine demonstrated that protection from 42 homologous challenge and disease can be achieved with formalin-inactivated virus given 43 intramuscularly (i.m.) or intranasally (i.n.) 8,10,11 .

Although the nAb titer 65 required for protection is not defined, early studies established inactivated HRV as protective in 66 humans, and immunogenicity in animals informed clinical testing.
Results and discussion 69 We first used BALB/c mice to test immunogenicity. We propagated HRVs in H1-HeLa 70 cells and inactivated infectivity using formalin. Sera from naïve mice had no detectable nAb 71 against HRV-16 ( Fig. 1) . Alum adjuvant enhanced the nAb response induced by i.m. inactivated 72 HRV-16 ( Fig. 1) . There was no effect of valency (comparing 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-valent) on the 73 nAb response induced by inactivated HRV-16 or to the 3 types in the 3-valent vaccine (HRV-16, 74 HRV-36, and HRV-78) (Fig. 1) . The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) titers of the 75 input viruses prior to inactivation (inactivated-TCID 50 ) are provided in Supplemental Table 1 . 76 Original antigenic sin can occur when sequential exposure to related virus variants results in 77 biased immunity to the type encountered first 32 . In bivalent HRV-immune mice, we observed 78 modest original antigenic sin following prime vaccination with 10-valent inactivated HRV, and 79 boost vaccination partially alleviated the effect (Supplemental Fig. 1) , similar to influenza 80 virus 32 . Collectively, these results prompted us to explore more fully the nAb response to 81 polyvalent HRV vaccine.
In 1975, it was reported that two different 10-valent inactivated HRV preparations 83 induced nAb titers to only 30-40% of the input virus types in recipient subjects 33 . However, the 84 input titers of viruses prior to inactivation ranged from 10 1.5 to 10 5.5 TCID 50 per ml, and these 85 were then diluted 10-fold to generate 10-valent 1.0 ml doses given i.m. as prime and boost with 86 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/053967 doi: bioRxiv preprint no adjuvant 33 . We hypothesized that low input antigen doses are responsible for poor nAb 87 responses to 10-valent inactivated HRV. We reconstituted the 1975 10-valent vaccine, as closely 88 as possible with available HRV types, over a 10 1 to 10 5 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose, and 89 we compared it to a 10-valent vaccine of the same types with input titers ranging from > 10 5 to > 90 10 7 inactivated-TCID 50 per dose. The reconstituted 1975 vaccine resulted in no detectable nAb 91 after prime vaccination and, following boost vaccination, nAb to the five types that had the 92 highest input titers (Fig. 2) . The high titer vaccine resulted in nAb to 5 of 10 types after prime 93 vaccination and all 10 types after the boost (Fig. 2) . Following the boost vaccinations, there 94 appeared to be a 10 4 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose threshold for the induction of nAb in 95 this model (Fig. 2b) . Above this titer, there was no correlation between input load and nAb Table 2 ) to accommodate the volume adjustment. The 10-valent inactivated 102 HRV vaccine induced nAb to 100% of input types following the prime and the boost (Fig. 3a) . 103 The nAb induced by 10-valent inactivated HRV were persisting at 203 days post-boost 104 (Supplemental Fig. 2) . The 25-valent inactivated HRV prime vaccination induced nAb to 18 of 105 25 (72%) virus types, and the 25-valent boost resulted in nAb against 24 of the 25 types (96%) 106 (Fig 3b) . The average nAb titer resulting from prime + boost was 2 7 for 10-valent and 2 6.8 for 25-107 valent.

In order to increase vaccine valency, we chose rhesus macaques (RMs) and a 1.0 ml i.m. Table 3 ). The 25-valent 114 vaccine induced nAb to 96% (RM A) and 100% (RM B) of input viruses following the prime 115 vaccination (Fig. 4a) . The 50-valent vaccine induced nAb to 90% (RM C) and 82% (RM D) of 116 input viruses following the prime vaccination (Fig. 4c) . The breadth of nAb following prime 117 vaccination in RM was superior to what we observed in mice, which may have been due to 118 animal species differences and/or higher inactivated-TCID 50 input titers in the RM vaccines.
Following boost vaccination, there were serum nAb titers against 100% of the types in 25-valent 120 HRV-vaccinated RMs (Fig. 4b) and 98% (49 out of 50) of the virus types in 50-valent HRV-121 vaccinated RMs (Fig. 4d) . The average nAb titer resulting from prime + boost in RMs was 2 9.3 122 for 25-valent and 2 8.6 for 50-valent.

1c66ec8950cbd1e0f0d4bc4a43ba9c79411cc5fa,"Viruses are one of the major causes of various acute and chronic infectious diseases and thus a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signalling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of viral evasion mechanisms and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape. author/funder.

Despite the tremendous improvement in the understanding of the antiviral immune response and the availability of therapeutics, existing and emerging viral diseases are an ever-growing problem, particularly in developing countries. Development of antiviral resistance of viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major concern (Irwin et al. 2016 , Howard and Fletcher 2012 , Bacon et al. 2003 . One of the main reasons for increasing resistances is the accumulation of mutations in the viral genome caused by multiple factors including the polymerase infidelity (Sanjuan and Domingo-Calap 2016, Peck and Lauring 2018) . Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged for better control of viral diseases.
This has led to turning the focus on the host for therapeutic intervention, where targeting the host factors has been proven to be useful for restricting viral infections (Zumla et al. 2016 , Kaufmann et al. 2018 . Anti-CXCR4 and anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies are examples of successful host-directed therapies for combating HIV Jacobson 2009, Carnec et al. 2005) .
Viruses have evolved to evade the host antiviral response at various stages starting from viral sensing to antiviral pro-inflammatory responses (Bowie and Unterholzner 2008 , Navratil et al. 2011 , Garcia-Sastre 2017 . Multiple studies attempted to understand global principles of the viral evasion employed by various viruses, including dengue virus (DENV), Ebola virus (EBOV), IAV and HIV (Pichlmair et al. 2012 , Rozenblatt-Rosen et al. 2012 , Jäger et al. 2011 , Shah et al. 2018 , Batra et al. 2018 , Söderholm et al. 2016 . Global systems-level approaches including functional RNAi screens, interactome mapping technologies such as affinitypreprint purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), quantitative proteomics and CRISPR/Cas9-based screens have provided unparalleled details and insights into the dynamics of host proteome in immune cells (Weekes et al. 2014 , Nightingale et al. 2018 , Kandasamy et al. 2016 , Ersing et al. 2017 ), host-virus interactome (Pichlmair et al. 2012 , Rozenblatt-Rosen et al. 2012 , Jäger et al. 2011 , Shapira et al. 2009 , Konig et al. 2010 , and also identified important host dependency factors of various viruses (Shapira et al. 2009 , Marceau et al. 2016 . Meta-analyses of such high-dimensional datasets have been crucial for identifying novel host factors as drug targets such as UBR4 in IAV infection (Tripathi et al. 2015) . Moreover, some of these factors represent drug targets for multiple viruses (Ianevski et al. 2018) .
We hypothesized that combining a meta-analysis of host-virus protein-protein interactions of multiple viruses and functional RNAi screens would provide novel insights for developing broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. For this, we assembled a host-virus protein-protein interactome of 5781 host-virus interactions (hereafter referred to as 'hvPPI') covering 183 viral proteins from 17 different viruses and 2381 host proteins. We performed extensive bioinformatics and network analysis and integrated this dataset with genome-wide or druggable-genome RNAi screen data from published studies. This resulted in the assembly of critical nodes of viral evasion and identification of core cellular processes and druggable nodes that were verified by a drug re-purposing screen using broad-spectrum antivirals.
Host-virus protein-protein interactions were downloaded from published studies (Pichlmair et al. 2012 , Rozenblatt-Rosen et al. 2012 , Jäger et al. 2011 , Shapira et al. 2009 , de Chassey et al. 2008 , Khadka et al. 2011 , Zhang et al. 2009 , Vidal et al. 2011 which included a total of 183 viral proteins, 2381 host proteins and 5781 host-virus interactions. Protein identifiers were mapped to UniProt IDs. Human protein-protein interaction data was imported from BioGRID database (version 3.4.139, Stark et al. 2006 ) covering 215244 interactions. The network analysis was performed using in-house programs developed in R statistical environment (version 3.4.3, www.r-project.org) with the use of the packages SparseM (version 1.77), RBGL (version 1.52.0) and graph (version 1.54.0). Network visualization was performed in Cytoscape (version 3.6.1, Shannon et al. 2003) . Network clusters/sub-networks were extracted using the Cytoscape plugin MCODE (version 1.5.1, Bader and Hogue 2003) . Data visualization was performed in R statistical environment and Cytoscape.
We performed gene-set enrichment analysis using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (version 6.8, Huang da et al. 2009 ). For all enrichment analysis, a p-value cutoff of ≤0.01 was used as significant. Protein disorder analysis was performed using IUPred2A software. We used the offline version with protein sequences downloaded from UniProt. Statistical analysis of disordered region distribution was performed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in R statistical environment. Annotation of human proteins was mapped from UniProt ID to ENSEMBL using EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86. The index of subcellular localization of interaction partners of single viral proteins was calculated for all viral proteins with ≥ five host targets. Localization of host targets was mapped using COMPARTMENTS (Binder et al. 2014) , filtered for a minimum evidence score of 3 in the knowledge channel, excluding non-experimental based preprint author/funder.

Evidence for all protein was subsequently divided by the absolute number of host-targets per viral protein. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using Clustal X (version 2.0, Larkin et al. 2007 ).
Genome-wide RNAi screen data for HCV (Tai et al. 2009 ) and HPV18 ( Smith et al. 2010, through GenomeRNAi database (Schmidt et al. 2013-GR00197) , as well as druggable RNAi screen data for HPV16 (Aydin et al. 2014) , VACV ) and SV40 were integrated in the existing network as Z-Scores. Drug-gene interaction data was downloaded from DGIdb. The identifiers were mapped to UniProt IDs and then compared with hvPPI.
Drug re-purposing screen For the HMPV NL/1/00 screen, approximately 4×10 4 human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates. The cells were grown for 24 h in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.35% NaHCO 3 , and 100 µg/ml streptomicine and 100 IU/ml penicillin. The medium was replaced with virus growth medium (VGM) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.35% NaHCO 3 , and 1 µg/mL L-1tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin in DMEM-F12. HCV screen-associated cell culture conditions are described in . The compounds were added to the cells in 3-fold dilutions at seven different concentrations starting from 50 µM. No compounds were added to the control wells. The cells were mock-or virus-infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of one. After 48 h of infection, the medium was removed from the cells. To monitor cell viability, CellTiter-Glo reagent containing Firefly luciferase and luciferin was added (30 µL per well). This assay quantifies ATP, an indicator of metabolically active living cells. The luminescence was measured with a plate reader. To determine compound efficacy, HMPV NL/1/00-induced GFP expression was measured. The half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) and the half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) for each compound were calculated after non-linear regression analysis with a variable slope using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0a. The relative effectiveness of the drug was quantified as the selectivity index (SI = CC 50 EC 50 ). Cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of the compounds against GFP-expressing HCV in Huh-7.5 cells was determined as previously described ). preprint 4 author/funder. All rights reserved.

To provide new and critical insights into viral evasion mechanisms we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of the host-virus interaction landscape. We assembled the host-virus protein-protein interaction data ('hvPPI') from published studies (Fig. 1A ) (Pichlmair et al. 2012 , Rozenblatt-Rosen et al. 2012 , Jäger et al. 2011 , Shapira et al. 2009 , de Chassey et al. 2008 , Khadka et al. 2011 , Zhang et al. 2009 , Vidal et al. 2011 ). This dataset covered 17 different viruses including adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5), dengue virus (DENV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), influenza A virus PR8 (IAV-PR8), influenza virus Udorn (IAV-Udorn), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), human papilloma virus 5 (HPV5), human papilloma virus 6B (HPV6B), human papilloma virus 8 (HPV8), human papilloma virus 11 (HPV11), human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16), human papilloma virus 18 (HPV18), human papilloma virus 33 (HPV33), Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), Simian virus 40 (SV40) and Vaccinia virus (VACV). This dataset comprised of protein-protein interactions from two different types of experimental methods -affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and yeast two-hybrid screens (Y2H). Altogether, this combined dataset includes 183 viral proteins, 2381 host proteins and 5781 protein-protein interactions ( Fig. 1B and Fig. S1 ). Many interactome networks including yeast and human are scale-free networks, where a large portion of the nodes (e.g. a protein in the network) have few interactions and only a few nodes have large number of interactions. The latter are often referred to as ""hubs"" which are crucial in keeping the network intact (Vidal et al. 2011) . We performed network topology analysis to infer the properties of the host proteins targeted by the viral proteins in the context of the human protein interactome. We considered two important parameters -relative betweenness centrality (which reflects the amount of information that passes through this protein in the human interactome) and degree (number of binding partners in the human interactome) of the host proteins targeted by each virus. The targets of all the viruses showed higher betweenness centrality and degree as compared to an average protein in the human interactome ( Fig. 1C and Fig. 1D ). This shows that viruses, by targeting ""hubs"" and proteins that serves as key communication nodes, have evolved the best way to disrupt the scale-free human interactome. This topological property thereby shows how viruses having small genomes achieve the maximal effect in rewiring the human interactome to benefit viral survival and replication. Our analysis is in agreement with several previous studies, which have highlighted this property (Pichlmair et al. 2012 , Rozenblatt-Rosen et al. 2012 , de Chassey et al. 2008 , Durmuş et al. 2015 , Franzosa and Xia 2011 . We propose that this could be a general principle for all viruses. preprint author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Proteins usually fold into stable three-dimensional structures that mediate specific functions. In addition, there are sub-structures in proteins termed ""intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)"" which lack stable structures under normal physiological conditions. IDRs are required for multiple cellular functions even though they lack these defined structures (Oldfield and Dunker 2014) . Many studies have highlighted the presence of such IDRs in viral proteins (Xue et al. 2014 , Tamarozzi and Giuliatti 2018 , Dyson and Wright 2018 , such as E6 from human papilloma virus, that are crucial for hijacking the cellular machinery. We analysed the host proteins from the hvPPI for presence of IDRs using the prediction software IUPred (Meszaros et al. 2018 ). We found a statistically significant enrichment (p-value < 6.246 × 10 −06 ) of IDRs in the host proteins targeted by viruses ( Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A ). We then identified the subnetwork in the hvPPI which contained the top host targets with high disorderness score (Fig. 2B) . The top five proteins with large IDRs include CD44 antigen (CD44), Serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 2 (SRRM2), Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 3 (BAG3) and Mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) (Fig. 2C ). CD44 is a marker of exhausted CD8+ T cells (Wherry and Kurachi 2015) and replication of HCV in T cells was shown to decrease cell proliferation by inhibiting CD44 expression and signalling (Kondo et al. 2009 ). SRRM2 is a serine/arginine-rich protein involved in RNA splicing (Blencowe et al. 2000) . SRRM2 is differentially phosphorylated in HIV-1 infected cells and absence of SRRM2 lead to increased HIV-1 gene expression, since it regulates the splicing of HIV-1 (Wojcechowskyj et al. 2013 ). In the hvPPI, SRRM2 is targeted by multiple viral proteins including the Tat protein from HIV-1. Tat protein has an important role in the stimulation of the transcription of the long terminal repeat (LTR) (Das et al. 2011 ). In addition, NS1 protein from influenza B virus has also been reported to interact with SRRM2 (Patzina et al. 2017) . Proteins of the MARCKS family are involved in a range of cellular processes including cell adhesion and migration (Arbuzova et al. 2002) . MARCKS is a negative regulator of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling in mouse macrophages (Mancek-Keber et al. 2012) . MAVS is an adaptor protein in the RIG-I signalling pathway involved in the sensing of RNA. Ablasser et al. (2009) reported that double-stranded DNA serves as a template for RNA polymerase II and is transcribed into a 5' triphosphate containing double-stranded RNA, which activates the RIG-I signalling pathway. In the hvPPI, MAVS is targeted by several proteins from dsDNA viruses such as EBV and HPV. Altogether, our analysis shows that the IDR-high part of the human proteome is an essential part of the viral evasion strategy and some of the selected targets highlighted here could show novel insights into the viral evasion mechanisms. However, the very flexible protein structure of disordered proteins also makes them also difficult to target with drugs. preprint author/funder. All rights reserved.

To assess the signalling pathways and cellular processes within the hvPPI, we identified highly connected subnetworks within hvPPI network. We constructed a host-host interaction network based on the host targets in the hvPPI and identified a number of highly connected subnetworks/clusters (Fig. 3) . We then performed a gene-set enrichment analysis of significantly enriched biological processes. We found one or more enriched processes for each of this subnetwork including core cellular processes such as proteasome, spliceosome, protein translation, protein/RNA transport, and cell cycle. Next we listed the viruses that target one or more of these processes, and found that almost all the core pathways and processes are targeted by all the 17 viruses that are part of the hvPPI (Fig. S3 ). This analysis highlights the core components of the cellular process subnetworks which are targeted as part of the viral evasion strategies and thus could be broad-spectrum antiviral hot-spots from a therapeutic point of view.

Given that the viral proteins were interacting with a large number of host proteins, we analysed the sub-cellular location of the host proteins. We performed gene-set enrichment analysis of sub-cellular localization information provided by UniProt database. We binned the localization into 11 compartments and estimated the percent of host proteins in a given compartment as compared to the total number of host proteins targeted by a given virus. We found that the viral targets were distributed across multiple subcellular compartments with cytoplasm being the most common (Fig. S4A ). The hvPPI includes two different strains of IAV-PR8 (H1N1) and Udorn (H3N2). The subcellular localization analysis showed that both strains were enriched for nuclear proteins. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) from both the strains had the highest number of nuclear targets but their targets were very different (Fig. 4A ). NS1 of Udorn was enriched for a large number of histones as compared to NS1 of PR8 that had large number of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), such as HNRNPU -a known restriction factor for many viruses. This corroborates with the observation that NS1 protein has short linear histone mimicry motifs that can suppress the host antiviral response (Marazzi et al. 2012) . In our analysis, we found that it is NS1 of Udorn that has a histone mimicry motif ""ARSK"" (Fig. S4B) . Similarly, HPV11 and HPV18 E5 proteins interact more often with host proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found both common and specific subsets of ER proteins targeted by the E5 protein (Fig.  4B ). HPV18 E5 protein ER targets were enriched for phospholipid biosynthesis as well as GPI anchor related proteins, such as phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class S/T/U (PIGS, PIGT and PIGU), glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment 1 (GPAA1) and phosphatidylserine synthase 2 (PTDSS2). HPV11 E5 protein ER targets were enriched for ER-associated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism involving host proteins such as ER degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein 3 (EDEM3) and ER lipid raft associated 1 (ERLIN1). ER targets common to HPV18 and HPV11 E5 protein were enriched for unfolded protein response, N-linked glycosylation and protein folding involving host proteins such as SRP receptor alpha/beta subunit (SRPRA/SRPRB) and catalytic subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (STT3A and STT3B). Two independent CRISPR/Cas9 screening studies identified multiple ER associated components including STT3A and STT3B as host factors for DENV, Zika virus (ZIKV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) , Marceau et al. 2016 . The non-canonical function of STT3A and STT3B is required for DENV replication and that NS1 protein of DENV interacts with these proteins (Marceau et al. 2016 ). Our orthogonal approach can lead to the identification of critical host factors, and similar functions of ER components, such as STT3A and STT3B, are used by HPV11 and HPV18 as well. Thus targeting the non-canonical function of STT3A and STT3B could be a broad antiviral strategy. Overall, the enrichment analysis clearly shows that there is commonality and specificity in the subcellular targets of the viral proteins and that detailed interrogation of these targets can give vital clues into the viral evasion mechanisms. preprint author/funder.

We found that host targets from the hvPPI were spread across the spectrum of genes with proviral as well as antiviral phenotype (Fig. S5) , thus showing that targeting of the host protein by the virus could lead into any direction that favours the virus. We then investigated the top 50 proviral genes that are also targeted by the viral proteins as seen in the hvPPI. We identified 42 host proteins (Fig. 5A ) that were significantly enriched for coatomer protein complex 1 (COPI), protein translation/transport and proteasome (Fig. 5B) . This further substantiates the findings from the earlier section on the core cellular processes targeted by the viruses. Network analysis of these top hits showed high level on connectivity and crosstalk -for example between the translation and proteasome machinery (Fig. 5C ). Vesicle carriers are involved in the transport of membranes and proteins. COPI system is one of the three vesicular carrier systems that is involved in the early secretory pathway (Beck et al. 2009 , Lee et al. 2004 , Bethune et al. 2006 . Moreover, it has been pointed out that there is a strong similarity between vesicular transport and viral transport (viral entry to budding process) (Thaa et al. 2010) ; thus making COPI system important for the viral life cycle. SiRNAbased silencing of COPI lead to a defect in entry of IAV and disruption of the COPI complex inhibited the production of infectious progeny virus (Sun et al. 2013) . Altogether, these top hits including the COPI system could serve as targets for developing therapeutic antiviral intervention strategies for a broad group of viruses.
Our analyses pointed out that viral evasion mechanism observed in one virus could also be relevant for other viruses. Thus, we wanted to test if we could target viral replication of other viruses based on the results from the hvPPI analyses. To get an estimate of the druggability of the hvPPI, we obtained known drug-gene interactions from DGIdb (Cotto et al. 2018) . The data from DGIdb included drug-gene interactions for 48 drugs that were investigational/experimental/approved safe-in-human antivirals compounds (Ianevski et al. 2018 ). Among these 48 broad-spectrum-antivirals, 28 of them had targets that are part of the hvPPI. Based on this overlap, we performed a targeted drug re-purposing screen with 35 of these 48 compounds (Table S1) to check for antiviral activity against and HCV, which is part of the hvPPI and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) which is not in the hvPPI.. We tested 35 broadspectrum-antivirals against GFP-expressing HMPV NL/1/00 strain (de Graaf et al. 2007) . Seven different concentrations of the compounds were added to HMPV or mock-infected cells. Cell viability was controlled after 48 hours and HMPV-induced GFP expression was tested to determine compound efficiency. After the initial screening, we identified five compounds, which lowered GFP-expression without detectable cytotoxicity (with SI > 3). We repeated the experiment with these compounds. The experiment confirmed novel activity of azacytidine, lopinavir, nitazoxanide, itraconazole and oritavancin against HMPV ( Fig. 6A and Table  1 ). Similarly, we examined toxicity and antiviral activity of broad-spectrum-antivirals against GFP-expressing HCV in Huh-7.5 cells using previously described procedures ). Our test identified azithromycin, cidofovir, oritavancin, dibucaine, gefitinib, minocycline and pirlindole mesylate as novel anti-HCV agents with SI > 3 ( Fig. 6B and Table 1 ).
In summary, our meta-analysis approach of the hvPPI could provide novel and faster approaches for the re-purposing of existing drugs as antiviral agents. preprint 13 author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Using integrative analysis of orthogonal datasets our study provides a comprehensive view of viral evasion mechanisms.
In particular our analysis of the hvPPI network revealed that all the viruses have evolved to target proteins that are central and have strong control over the human interactome. Host proteins targeted by viruses contain a high proportion of intrinsically disordered regions. We identified the core cellular processes and associated proteins that are targeted by all viruses. Detailed comparative analysis of the subcellular localization of the host proteins showed commonality and specificity both between viral proteins from different strains of the same virus; and between viruses. Integrating hvPPI with functional RNAi screens showed that a large portion of the hvPPI are host factors of one or more virus. hvPPI data-based drug re-purposing screen identified novel activities for various broad-spectrum antivirals against HMPV and HCV.
This unique dataset can be used for further detailed interrogation of the mechanisms behind viral evasion. This could serve as a starting point for identifying novel host targets and generating hypothesis in the context of viral evasion and development of pan-viral therapeutic intervention strategies. The methods described here also provide unique ways of dissecting the orthogonal datasets. Various analyses from this study have highlighted the existence on pan-viral evasion points that could be utilised for the development of host-directed antiviral therapies. It is also intriguing to see that there is commonality and specificity at the level of subcellular localization of the viral targets. Our analyses have underlined some salient features in the context of IAV, HPV, DENV and HCV. Further detailed analysis in this context along with protein sequence features, such as Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) (Davey et al. 2011 ) would provide novel insights as well as deeper understanding of how small sequence features are involved in the hijacking of the host machinery. Integration of such data with known druggene interactions provides a clear estimate of the druggable proportion in the hvPPI. Our meta-analysis approach of the hvPPI could provide novel avenues of re-purposing existing drugs for antiviral targeting strategies.
Our study demonstrated that azacytidine, itraconazole, lopinavir, nitazoxanide, and oritavancin are novel experimental anti-HMPV agents, whereas cidofovir, dibucaine, azithromycin, gefitinib, minocycline, oritavancin, and pirlindole mesylate are novel anti-HCV drugs. These drugs have already been used as investigational agents or experimental drug in different virus infections. Although, the mechanisms of action of these compounds in inhibiting the viral infections are still unknown, this agent could inhibit steps of viral infections, which preceded reporter protein expression from viral RNA. In summary, our results indicate that existing broad-spectrum-antivirals could be re-purposed to other viral infections. Re-purposing these therapeutics could save resources and time needed for development of novel drugs to quickly address unmet medical needs, because safety profiles of these agents are available. Effective treatment with broad-spectrum-antivirals may shortly become available, pending the results of further pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. This, in turn, means that some broadspectrum-antivirals could be used for rapid management of new or emerging drug-resistant strains, as well as for first-line treatment or for prophylaxis of acute virus infections or for viral co-infections.

1d2947d5c0addcbbcfa71d87ea074a8b6ff2a973,"An epidemic can be characterized by its speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r) and strength (i.e., the reproductive number R). Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like R = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of ""test-and-treat"" interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.","An epidemic can be described by its speed and strength. The speed of an epidemic is characterized by the exponential growth rate r, which measures how fast an epidemic grows at the population level. The strength of an epidemic is characterized by the reproductive number R, which measures how many new cases are caused by a typical individual case. Knowing the speed and strength of an epidemic allows predictions about the course of the epidemic and the effectiveness of intervention strategies.
Much research has prioritized estimates of R, and particularly its value in a fully susceptible population, called the basic reproductive number R 0 , because R has a threshold value (i.e., R = 1) that determines whether a disease can invade, the level of equilibrium, and the effectiveness of control efforts (Anderson and May, 1991; Diekmann et al., 1990) . The insight that a case must on average cause at least one new case under good conditions for a disease to persist goes back > 100 years (Ross, 1911) ; the idea of averaging by defining a 'typical' case was formalized 30 years ago (Diekmann et al., 1990) . R is also of interest because it provides a prima facie prediction about the total size of an epidemic (Anderson and May, 1991; Ma and Earn, 2006; Arino et al., 2007; Andreasen, 2011; Miller, 2012) .
Here, we show that r can also serve as a threshold, and also provide a useful metric for difficulty of elimination. We first generalize the idea that R measures the difficulty of elimination by showing we can measure an intervention's ""strength"" on the same scale as the reproductive number. We then show that we can likewise measure an intervention's ""speed"", and that there is a duality between the threshold R = 1 and a corresponding minimal intervention strength required for elimination, and the threshold r = 0 and a corresponding minimal intervention speed. We argue that the historical primacy of R over r is partly artificial, and discuss cases where strength provides the better framing for practical disease questions and cases where speed does.
We model disease incidence using the renewal equation, a simple, flexible framework that can cover a wide range of model structures (Heesterbeek and Dietz, 1996; Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000; Roberts, 2004; Aldis and Roberts, 2005; Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007; Champredon et al., 2018) . In our model, disease incidence at time t is given by:
Here, K(τ, t) is the infection kernel describing how infectious we expect an individual infected τ time units ago to be in the population. In general, K(τ, t) will depend on population characteristics that may change through time t -notably, the proportion of the population susceptible, S(t). Since we are interested in invasion and control, we will generally neglect changes in K(τ, t) through time. Thus, we will assume K(τ, t) ≡ K(τ ). Importantly, this (Park et al., 2019) . The infection kernel after applying each intervention strategyK(τ ) is shown in red. (A) The effect of a constant-strength intervention with θ = 1.5. A constant-strength intervention reduces the density by a constant proportion:K(τ ) = K(τ )/θ; when the strength of intervention matches the strength of epidemic (θ = R), the resulting distribution is equivalent to the intrinsic generation-interval distribution (K(τ ) = g(τ )). (B) A constant-speed intervention with φ ≈ 0.0267/day is applied to the same kernel. A constant-speed intervention reduces the density exponentially: K(τ ) = K(τ ) exp(−φτ ); when the speed of intervention matches the speed of epidemic (φ = r), the resulting distribution is equivalent to the initial backward generation-interval distribution (K(τ ) = b(τ )).
means we are neglecting changes in susceptible proportion through time: S(t) ≈ S(0). Under this assumption, the renewal equation is equivalent to the Von Foerster equations (see e.g. Fraser et al. (2004) ).
Assuming that the infection kernel K doesn't change with time, we write:
where g(τ ) is the ""intrinsic"" generation-interval distribution. The generation interval is defined as the time between when a person becomes infected and when that person infects another person (Svensson, 2007) ; therefore, the intrinsic generation-interval distribution g(τ ) gives the relative infectiousness of an average individual as a function of time since infection (Champredon and Dushoff, 2015) . Since g is a distribution, it integrates to 1, and the basic reproductive number R is thus the integral of K. Imagine a control measure that proportionally reduces K, for example, by protecting a 3 .

We then have:
(3)
Since g is a distribution, the reduction needed to prevent invasion (or to eliminate disease) is exactly θ = R. We call θ the ""strength"" of the intervention; transmission is interrupted when the strength of the intervention θ is larger than the strength of spread R. We generalize this idea by allowing an intervention strategy to reduce K by different proportions over the course of an individual infection. We write the post-intervention kernel:
where L(τ ) is the average proportional reduction for an individual infected time τ ago. The post-intervention reproductive number is thus:
This framework generalizes the work of Fraser et al. (2004) who made parametric assumptions about the shape of L(τ ).
We define the strength of the intervention L to be θ = R/R. It is then straightforward to show that θ is the harmonic mean of L(τ ) weighted by generation-interval distribution:
In this more general case, we have again that the disease cannot spread when θ ≥ R.
The Euler-Lotka equation allows us to calculate the initial exponential growth rate r of an epidemic given an infection kernel K:
By analogy with the strength-based factorization (2), we can rewrite (7) as a speed-based factorization:
Like g, b is a distribution: in this case the initial backward generation interval, which gives the distribution of realized generation times (measured from the infectee's point of view) when the disease spreads exponentially (Champredon and Dushoff, 2015; Britton and Scalia Tomba, 2019) . Now imagine an intervention that reduces transmission at a constant hazard rate φ across the disease generation ( Fig. 1B) , for example, by identifying and isolating infectious individuals. We then have:
Since b is a distribution (which integrates to 1), the reduction needed to prevent invasion (or to eliminate disease) is exactly φ = r. We call φ the ""speed"" of the intervention; transmission is interrupted when the speed of the intervention is faster than the speed of spread. We generalize this idea by allowing the hazard rate h(τ ) at which K is reduced to vary through time, thus:K
The associated post-intervention epidemic speedr is given by:
We define the speed of a general intervention to be φ = r −r. We can then show that φ is a (sort of) mean satisfying the implicit equation:
Specifically, the speed φ is a mean of the hazard h in the sense that an increase (or decrease) in h produces the same sign of change in φ, and if h is constant across the generation then φ = h.
In this section, we use both strength-and speed-based decompositions to compare different intervention strategies for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In particular, we study how the amount of early HIV transmission affects estimates of intervention effectiveness. These examples are not detailed estimates for specific scenarios; instead, they are meant to demonstrate how strength-and speed-based decompositions can help evaluate control strategies.
We model the infection kernel of the HIV as a sum of two gamma distributions:
The first component, f early (τ ), models early HIV transmission during the acute infection stage. We assume that f early (τ ) has a mean of 3 months (Hollingsworth et al., 2008) and a shape parameter of 3. The second component, f late , models HIV transmission during the asymptomatic stage and the disease stage (after progression to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)). We assume that f late (τ ) has a mean of 10 years (Brookmeyer and Goedert, 1989; Nishiura, 2019) and a shape parameter of 2 (to roughly match the wide generationinterval distribution of HIV (Fraser et al., 2004) ). Finally, p early is the proportion of early HIV transmission.
The infection kernel is shown in (Fig. 2A) for our baseline value of p early = 0.23. We assume that the initial speed of the epidemic is r = 0.452 year −1 (Fig. 2B) , and ask what value 5 .

We assume that the baseline proportion of early transmission is 23% (Hayes and White, 2006) . (B) Time series of HIV prevalence in pregnant women in South Africa, 1990 -2010 (Barron et al., 2013 . The initial exponential growth rate of the HIV is estimated by fitting a straight line to log-prevalence (1990 -1997) of R 0 would produce this rate of growth. When transmission is fast, (i.e., when p early is large), individuals don't need to transmit as much to achieve this speed, so the estimated value of R 0 decreases (Fig. 2C) . Therefore, as p early gets smaller, we expect stronger intervention to be required in order to control the disease.
We compare two different possible intervention strategies to shed light on the speed and strength decompositions. First, we consider a condom intervention that reduces HIV transmission by approximately 75% at the population level. Assuming that condoms act as a physical barrier, and that condom use will, on average, remain roughly constant through time, it is reasonable to model the proportional reduction in transmission due to condom use as constant across the course of infection: L condom = 1/(1 − 0.75) = 4 (Fig. 3A) . The estimated strength of such an intervention is simply the average of L condom , i.e., θ = 4, whereas the estimated strength of the epidemic decreases as the proportion of early transmission increases (Fig. 3B) . Thus, the predicted effectiveness of the condom intervention will depend strongly on our estimate of the importance of early transmission: if early transmission is low, we expect disease spread to be too strong to be controlled completely by our intervention.
Next, we consider a ""test-and-treat"" strategy in which infected individuals are identified, linked to care and receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) with the goal of both preserving health and preventing transmission through viral suppression. (Garnett and Baggaley, 2009; Granich et al., 2009; Nah et al., 2017) . Our assumptions for this scenario are shown in Fig. 4 . We assume that the hazard rate h test of this intervention starts at 0 (because there is no way for newly infected individuals to know that they have HIV) but increases very 6 .

The corresponding strength of intervention L is shown in Fig. 4A and details of the assumption are given in the caption.
In this example, we see that, as p early goes down and our estimate of epidemic strength increases, the estimate of intervention strength increases roughly in parallel. The increase in intervention strength makes sense, as we have more time to reach people on average before they transmit: this is the core of the result of Eaton and Hallett (2014) . In our scenario, we predict that the intervention remains effective over the range of considered parameters.
Though there is a clear intuition for why both strengths increase as early transmission goes down, the speed paradigm provides insight into why these two increases are so close to parallel. The estimated epidemic speed depends only on the observed growth rate -it does not change if we change our assumption about the proportion of early transmission. For the test-and-treat intervention, the effective epidemic speed also stays relatively constant (Fig. 4D) , in part because we have (plausibly) assumed that hazard stays relatively constant for a few key months, and in part because the backward generation-interval distributions for different scenarios are relatively similar. The intervention speed increases slightly as proportion of early transmission increases because the subpopulation that the intervention fails to reach become relatively more important if late transmission is more important. Thus, the speed paradigm provides an intuitive underpinning for the originally surprising result of Eaton and Hallett (2014) : the effectiveness of test-and-treat interventions should not depend much on the proportion of early transmission. 7 .

(D) The estimated amount of early transmission has little effect on the effective speed of intervention, and none on the speed of the epidemic estimated from incidence data. Circles indicate the baseline scenario. Test-and-treat intervention is modeled phenomenologically: L test (τ ) = exp ( τ 0 h test (σ)dσ) and h test (τ ) = h max (1 − exp(−Kf (τ ))), where f (τ ) is a gamma probability density function with a mean of 1 year and a shape parameter of 2, K = 4/ max(f (τ )), and h max = 2 year −1 .
The effectiveness of an epidemic intervention is often measured by its ability to reduce the reproductive number -R, or outbreak ""strength"" -below 1. The exponential growth rate 8 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.974048 doi: bioRxiv preprint -r, or outbreak ""speed"" -is often seen just as a stepping stone to R or even overlooked entirely (Park et al., 2020) . We argue that R and r provide equally valid, complementary perspectives on epidemic control, and that there are situations where each provides a clearer picture than the other.
In this study, we: first extended the standard paradigm of R as critical parameter for control, by defining the strength of an intervention on the same scale as R, the strength of the epidemic; then constructed a parallel interpretation which measures the speed of an intervention on the same scale as r, the speed of an epidemic. We thus showed that the standard paradigm for R and control has a natural parallel interpretation in terms of r.
To illustrate this idea, we used simple assumptions to explore the effects of two HIV intervention strategies (condoms and test-and-treat), using both strength-and speed-based frameworks. In particular, we provided an alternative explanation for the result of Eaton and Hallett (2014) who used detailed mathematical modeling of HIV transmission to show that the amount of early transmission does not affect the effectiveness of the ART: we can control an outbreak if we can identify infected individuals and enroll them on ART faster than the observed rate at which new cases are generated, which does not depend on the estimates of the amount of early transmission. The original explanation of the result relied on a strength-based argument: increasing the amount of early transmission decreases the basic reproductive number, which negatively correlates with the outcome of the ART intervention (Eaton and Hallett, 2014) .
While both speed-and strength-based frameworks can give the same conclusion about the outcome of an intervention, sometimes one provides a clearer understanding of a given measure. For example, we expect the speed-based framework to be clearer for characterizing newly invading pathogens: when an epidemic is growing exponentially, the reproductive number cannot be estimated with confidence (Weitz and Dushoff, 2015) , especially when there is large uncertainty in the shape of the generation-interval distribution (Park et al., 2020) . Conversely, we expect the strength-based framework to be clearer for evaluating established pathogens (based on the effective proportion of the population susceptible). For interventions, we expect the speed-based framework to be clearer for evaluating intervention strategies that work at the individual level, like test-and-treat for HIV (Granich et al., 2009) , or contact-tracing and quarantine for COVID-19 (Hellewell et al., 2020) ; we expect the strength-based framework to be clearer for intervention strategies that seek to reduce the overall transmission at the population level, like condom use. In other cases, such as real-time rollout of vaccines during an outbreak, both speed and strength approaches might be similarly uncertain because the result depends both on the speed of the rollout and the (strength-like) final coverage (Shah et al., 2018) .
When comparing interventions with epidemic parameters to evaluate strategies, the situation is similar. Some scenarios lend themselves naturally to a single approach. For example, in the classic case of vaccination to eliminate a previously established childhood disease, both disease spread and intervention can be clearly characterized using strength (Anderson and May, 1985) . In our HIV example, both the HIV epidemic and the test-and-treat intervention can be best characterized using speed. Other cases, such as using social distancing (a strength-like intervention) in the early stages of COVID-19 (epidemic speed is observed) may not fit so neatly into either paradigm, however.
There is an analogy here with measures of fitness in theoretical ecology. For example, when a population is regulated by density dependence that affects all individuals identically, r may be the best measure of fitness (Pasztor et al., 1996) , but when regulation primarily affects juveniles mortality, R is likely to be superior (Mylius and Diekmann, 1995) . The importance of speed-based perspectives are still rarely recognized in the case of infectious disease, however.
Responses to the 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa and the recent COVID-19 outbreak show an over-emphasis on strength at the expense of speed: during the early phases of both outbreaks, many disease modelers tried to estimate R 0 but overlooked r. For example, only 1 out of 7 preliminary analyses of the COVID-19 outbreak that were published as preprints between January 23-26, 2020 reported the doubling time of an epidemic (Bedford et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Majumder and Mandl, 2020; Read et al., 2020; Riou and Althaus, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . We suggest that infectious disease modelers should be aware of the complementarity of these two frameworks when analyzing disease outbreaks.

1d882d90109fb4496088342cf2bcaa4fec40cf9f,"Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, postkala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL.
visceral leishmaniasis | post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis | spatiotemporal transmission | transmission tree | Bayesian inference S patiotemporal heterogeneity in incidence is a hallmark of 1 infectious diseases. Insight into this heterogeneity has in-2 creased considerably in recent years due to greater availability 3 of geo-located individual-level epidemiological data and the 4 development of sophisticated statistical inference methods for 5 partially observed transmission processes (1-6). These meth-6 ods have been developed for epidemics, in which the immune 7 status of the population is known, and for diseases with a 8 short time course that are relatively easily diagnosed, such 9 as measles, influenza, and foot-and-mouth disease (3, 4, 7).
Here, we extend these methods to a slowly progressing endemic 11 disease of humans in which asymptomatic infection plays an 12 important role. 13 We analyse detailed longitudinal individual-level data on 14 incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-15 kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic 16 community in Fulbaria, Bangladesh (8). VL, also known as 17 kala-azar, is a lethal sandfly-borne parasitic disease targeted 18 for elimination as a public health problem (<1 case/10,000 19 people/year at subdistrict/district level depending on the 20 country) in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) by 2020 (9). PKDL 21 is a non-lethal skin condition that occurs after treatment 22 for VL in 5-20% of cases in the ISC, and less frequently in 23 individuals who report no history of prior VL (8, 10). It is 24 characterised by skin lesions of di ering severity and parasite 25 load, ranging from macules and papules (least severe, lowest 26 load) to nodules (most severe, highest load) (11). We estimate 27 the relative contributions of di erent disease states (VL, PKDL 28 and asymptomatic infection) to transmission, and quantify the 29 rate of spread of infection around infected individuals in space 30 and time by reconstructing transmission trees. Our analysis 31 provides insight into the spatiotemporal spread of visceral 32 leishmaniasis as well as quantitative estimates that can guide 33 the targeting of interventions, such as active case detection 34 and indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide, around VL 35
Although methods for analysing individual-level geo-located disease data have existed for some time, they have rarely been used to analyse endemic human diseases. Here we apply such methods to nearly a decade's worth of uniquely detailed epidemiological data on incidence of the deadly vector-borne disease visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and its secondary condition, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), to quantify the spread of infection around cases in space and time by inferring who infected whom, and estimate the relative contribution of different infection states to transmission. Our findings highlight the key role long diagnosis delays and PKDL play in maintaining VL transmission. This detailed characterisation of the spatiotemporal transmission of VL will help inform targeting of interventions around VL and PKDL cases. : medRxiv preprint 131 sion (over and above that from being at zero distance from 132 an infectious individual) and with di erent pre-symptomatic 133 and asymptomatic relative infectiousness.

We estimated the transmission model 144 parameters and unobserved data using the Markov Chain 145 Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm described in Materials and 146 Methods and SI Text.

PKDL has therefore been recognised as a major 49 potential threat to the VL elimination programme in the ISC 50 (10), which has led to increased active PKDL case detection. 51 Nevertheless, the contribution of PKDL to transmission in 52 field settings still urgently needs to be quantified. 53 Although the incidence of asymptomatic infection is 4 to 54 17 times higher than that of symptomatic infection in the 55 ISC (21), the extent to which asymptomatic individuals con- (Fig. 1A) . The data from this study are fully de-105 scribed elsewhere (8, 31) . Briefly, month of onset of symptoms, 106 treatment, relapse, and relapse treatment were recorded for 107 VL cases and PKDL cases with onset between 2002 and 2010 108 (retrospectively for cases with onset before 2007), and year of 109 onset was recorded for VL cases with onset before 2002. There 110 were 1018 VL cases and 190 PKDL cases with onset between 111 January 2002 and December 2010 in the study area, and 413 112 VL cases with onset prior to January 2002. 113 Over the whole study area, VL incidence followed an epi-114 demic wave, increasing from approximately 40 cases/10,000/yr 115 in 2002 to ≥90 cases/10,000/yr in 2005 before declining to 116 <5 cases/10,000/yr in 2010 (Fig. 1B) . PKDL incidence fol-117 lowed a similar pattern but lagging VL incidence by roughly 118 2yrs, peaking at 30 cases/10,000/yr in 2007. However, VL 119 and PKDL incidence varied considerably across paras (aver-120 age para-level incidences: VL 18-124 cases/10,000/yr, PKDL 121 0-31 cases/10,000/yr, Table S5 ) and time (range of annual 122 para-level incidences: VL 0-414 cases/10,000/yr, PKDL 0-120 123 cases/10,000/yr, Fig. S15 ). ú CI = credible interval, calculated as the 95% highest posterior density interval † risk of subsequent VL/asymptomatic infection if susceptible ‡ based on assumed infectiousness § in the absence of background transmission and relative to living directly outside the case household.
Based on the relative infectiousness of VL and the di erent 151 types of PKDL from the xenodiagnostic data, in the absence 152 of any other sources of transmission, the estimated probability 153 of being infected and developing VL if living in the same 154 household as a single symptomatic individual for 1 month 155 following their onset was 0.018 (95% CI: 0.013, 0.024) for VL 156 and ranged from 0.009 to 0.023 (95% CIs: (0.007,0.013)-(0.018, 157 0.031)) for macular/papular PKDL to nodular PKDL. Living 158 in the same household as a single asymptomatic individual, 159 the monthly risk of VL was only 0.00037 (95% CI: 0.00027, 160 0.00049), if asymptomatic individuals are 2% as infectious as 161 VL cases. 162 The risk of infection if living in the same household as an 163 infectious individual was estimated to be more than 10 times 164 higher than that if living directly outside the household of an 165 infectious individual (hazard ratio = 12.0), with a 95% CI 166 well above 1 (8.3, 16.7). The estimated spatial kernel (Fig. 167  S16 ) around each infectious individual shows a relatively rapid 168 decay in risk with distance outside their household, the risk of 169 infection halving over a distance of 84m (95% CI: 71, 99m).
mission. We assess the contribution of di erent infectious 172 groups to transmission in terms of their relative contribu-173 tion to the transmission experienced by susceptible individuals 174 ( Fig. 2A and Fig. S17 ). The contribution of VL cases was 175 fairly stable at around 75% from 2002 to the end of 2004 176 before decreasing steadily to 0 at the end of the epidemic, 177 while the contribution of PKDL cases increased from 0 in 178 2002 to ≥73% in 2010 (95% CI: 63, 80%) (Fig. S17) . Only a 179 small proportion of the total infection pressure on susceptible 180 individuals, varying between 9% and 14% over the course of 181 the epidemic, was estimated to have come from asymptomatic 182 and pre-symptomatic individuals. Reconstructing the Transmission Tree. By sampling 1,000 193 transmission trees from the joint posterior distribution of 194 the transmission parameters and the unobserved data (as de-195 scribed in Materials and Methods), we can build a picture of 196 the most likely source of infection for each case and how infec-197 tion spread in space and time. Fig. 3 shows the transmission 198 tree at di erent points in time in part of the south-east cluster 199 of villages. Early in the epidemic and at its peak (Figures 3A 200 and 3B), most new infections were due to VL cases. Towards 201 the end of the epidemic, some infections were most likely due 202 to PKDL cases and there was some saturation of infection 203 around VL cases (Fig. 3C) . The inferred patterns of trans-204 mission suggest that disease did not spread radially outward 205 from index cases over time, but instead made a combination 206 of short and long jumps around cases with long durations of 207 symptoms and households with multiple cases. . Arrows show the most likely source of infection for each case infected up to that point in time over 1,000 sampled transmission trees, and are coloured by the type of infection source and shaded according to the proportion of trees in which that individual was the most likely infector (darker shading indicating a higher proportion). Asymptomatic infections are not shown for clarity. S/A = susceptible or asymptomatic, E = pre-symptomatic, I = VL, R = recovered, D = dormantly infected, P = PKDL (see SI Text). GPS locations of individuals are jittered slightly so that individuals from the same household are more visible. An animated version showing all months is provided in SI movie 1. There is considerable heterogeneity in the estimated contri- by each VL/PKDL case is typically less than 1 (Fig. S19A ).
The times after onset of symptoms in the infector at which 336 secondary VL cases become infected are typically longer for 337 PKDL infectors than for VL infectors (Fig. 4B) detected after a longer delay than subsequent cases and there 356 will be some delay in mounting a reactive intervention, such 357 as active case detection and/or targeted IRS around the index 358 case(s), interventions will need to be applied in a large radius 359 (up to 500m) around index cases to be confident of capturing 360 all secondary cases and limiting transmission.
Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for 362 spatial clustering of infection and disease when modelling 363 VL transmission. Previous VL transmission dynamic models 364 (23, 41-43) have significantly overestimated the relative con-365 tribution of asymptomatic infection to transmission (as up 366 to 80%), despite assuming asymptomatic individuals are only 367 1-3% as infectious as VL cases, by treating the population 368 as homogeneously mixing, such that all asymptomatic indi-369 viduals can infect all susceptible individuals via sandflies. In 370 reality, asymptomatic individuals do not mix homogeneously 371 with susceptible individuals as they are generally clustered 372 together around or near to VL cases (25, 28), who are much 373 more infectious and therefore more likely to infect suscepti-374 ble individuals around them, even if they are outnumbered 375 by asymptomatic individuals. Asymptomatic infection also 376 leads to immunity, and therefore local depletion of suscep-377 tible individuals around infectious individuals. Hence, for 378 the same relative infectiousness, the contribution of asymp-379 tomatic individuals to transmission is much lower when spatial 380 heterogeneity is taken into account.
Nonetheless, our results suggest that asymptomatic indi-382 viduals do contribute a small amount to transmission and 383 that they can ""bridge"" gaps between VL cases in transmission 384 chains, as the best-fitting model has non-zero asymptomatic 385 relative infectiousness. Superficially, this appears to conflict 386 with preliminary results of xenodiagnosis studies in which 387 asymptomatic individuals have failed to infect sandflies ac-388 cording to microscopy (44). However, historical (12, 45) and 389 experimental (46) data show that provision of a second blood 390 meal and optimal timing of sand fly examination are criti-391 cal to maximizing sensitivity of xenodiagnosis. These data 392 suggest that recent xenodiagnosis studies (11, 44), in which 393 dissection occurred within 5 days of a single blood meal, may 394 underestimate the potential infectiousness of symptomatic 395 and asymptomatic infected individuals. Occurrence of VL in 396 isolated regions where there are asymptomatically infected 397 individuals, but virtually no reported VL cases (27, 47), also 398 seems to suggest that asymptomatic individuals can generate 399 VL cases. However, it is possible that some individuals who de-400 veloped VL during the study went undiagnosed and untreated, 401 and that we have inferred transmissions from asymptomatic 402 individuals in locations where cases were missed. We will in-403 vestigate the potential role of under-reporting in future work. 404
The analysis presented here is not without limitations. As 405 can be seen from the model simulations (Fig. S20) , the model is 406 not able to capture the full spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the 407 observed VL incidence when fitted to the data from the whole 408 study area, as it underestimates the number of cases in higher-409 incidence paras (e.g. paras 1, 4 and 12). There are various 410 possible reasons why the incidence in these paras might have 411 been higher, including higher sandfly density, lower initial lev-412 els of immunity, variation in infectiousness between cases and 413 within individuals over time, dose-dependence in transmission 414 (whereby flies infected by VL cases are more likely to create 415 VL cases than flies infected by asymptomatic individuals (22)), 416

113 Incubation period. Following previous work (1), we model the incubation period as negative binomially distributed NB(r, p) 114 with fixed shape parameter r = 3 and 'success' probability parameter p, and support starting at 1 (such that the minimum 115 incubation period is 1 month):
We estimate p in the MCMC algorithm for inferring the model parameters and missing data (see below).
VL onset-to-treatment time distribution. Several VL cases with onset before 2002 have missing symptom onset and/or treatment times (only their onset year is recorded), and may therefore have been infectious at the start of the study period. In order to be able to infer the onset-to-treatment times of these cases, OT Õ j = min(R Õ j , D Õ j ) ≠ I Õ j (j = 1, . . . , nI 0 ), in the MCMC algorithm 121 (see below) we model the onset-to-treatment time distribution as a negative binomial distribution NB(r1, p1) and fit to the 122 onset-to-treatment times of all VL cases for whom both onset and treatment times were recorded ( Figure S2A ):

where fitting to the recorded gaps gives p4 = 0.13 (corresponding to a mean time to relapse of 7.9 months). Relapse cases are 156 assumed to be uninfectious from their treatment month to their relapse time and their duration of symptoms upon relapse 157 is assumed to follow the same distribution as the onset-to-treatment time for a first VL episode (Eq. (5)). We assume all 158 relapse cases were treated for relapse before the end of the study, since the latest treatment time for primary VL in a case that 168

Model for initial status of non-symptomatic individuals. As there was transmission and VL in the population before the start The probabilities of each non-symptomatic individual initially present (i.e. with Vj = 0) being susceptible, asymptomatically infected, or recovered from asymptomatic infection at time t = 0 can then be found by calculating the probability of avoiding infection in every month from their birth to the start of the study, summing over the probabilities of being infected in one of the months between their birth and the start of the study and recovering after the start of the study, and summing over the 6 of 37 probabilities of being infected in a month before the start of the study and recovering before the start of the study, respectively: pS 0 (aj) := P(Aj > 0, Rj > 0) = e ≠⁄ 0 a j [13] pA 0 (aj) := P(Aj AE 0,
where aj is the age of individual j in months at t = 0. Since we assume that non-symptomatic individuals who are born, or 183 who immigrate into the study area, after the start of the study (with Vj > 0) are susceptible, for notational convenience we 184 define the probabilities for these individuals as pS 0 (aj) = 1, pA 0 (aj) = pR 0 (aj) = 0. We estimate the historical asymptomatic infection rate, ⁄0, by fitting the model to age-prevalence data on leishmanin skin 186 test (LST) positivity amongst non-symptomatic individuals from a cross-sectional survey of three of the study paras conducted 187 in 2002 (28) (see Figure S4 ).

the mean of the last k ≠ f (k) + 1 samples; 0 is the initial guess for the covariance matrix, and k0 determines the rate at 442 which the influence of 0 on k+1 decreases (the weight of 0 halves after the first 2k0 iterations). We use k0 = 1000 here.
If f (k) = f (k ≠ 1) (i.e. if k is odd with f (k) chosen as above), an additional observation is added to the estimate of the 444 covariance matrix

It has been shown that N (k , 2.38 2 /n -), where is the covariance matrix of the posterior distribution, is the optimal 453 proposal distribution for rapid convergence and e cient mixing of the MCMC chain for symmetric product-form posterior 454 distributions as nae OE, and leads to an acceptance rate of 23.4% (38, 39) . This corresponds to a scaling of c k = 1 in Eq. (23).
However, we are in a context with a large amount of missing data, which is strongly correlated with some of the transmission 456 parameters (see Parameter estimates below), so the posterior distribution is not symmetric, and this scaling is not optimal. 457 We therefore follow (36) and scale c k adaptively as the algorithm progresses to target an acceptance rate of approximately 458 23.4% for updates to -. We do this by rescaling c k by a factor of x k > 1 every time an acceptance occurs and by a factor of 459 x ‹/(‹≠1) k < 1 every time a rejection occurs such that the acceptance rate ‹ approaches 23.4% in the long run,
if proposal is rejected.
In order to satisfy the 'Diminishing Adaptation' condition (40), which is necessary to ensure the Markov chain is ergodic and converges to the correct posterior distribution, it is required that c k tends to a constant as k ae OE. So that the adaptation 463 diminishes as k increases, we use the sequence 465 where m0 is the number of iterations over which the scaling factor x k decreases from 2 to 1.5. Here, we use m0 = 100.
Model comparison 467 We compare the goodness of fit of models with di erent asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic relative infectiousness (between 0% and 2% of that of VL cases), with and without additional within-household transmission, to test di erent assumptions about how infectious asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals are, using DIC (41). DIC measures the trade-o between model fit and complexity and lower values indicate better fit. Since some variables were not observed, we use a version of DIC appropriate for missing data from (42), which is based on the complete data likelihood L(◊; Z) = P(Y, X|◊). This is equivalent to the standard version of DIC for fully observed data except that it is averaged over the missing data:
where D(◊) is the deviance (the measure of model fit), given (up to an additive constant dependent only on the data) by .

The relative contribution of state X to the infection pressure on the ith VL case at their infection time, i.e. the probability 483 that i's infection source is X (Fig. 2B in the main text), is:

The probability that the ith VL case is infected from the background transmission is ' ⁄i(Ei ≠ 1)

Reconstructing the epidemic Reconstructing the transmission tree. We reconstruct the transmission tree following the 'sequential approach' described 488 in (44). We draw N samples (◊ k , X k ) (k = 1, . . . , N) from the joint posterior distribution from the MCMC, calculate the 489 probability that infectee i was infected by individual j conditional on their infection time Ei and uncertainty in the parameter values and missing data (over the posterior distribution). We use N = 1000 here.
Calculating transmission distances and times. The mean infector-to-VL-infectee distance and mean infector-onset-to-VLinfectee-infection time for each VL and PKDL infector ( Figures 4A and 4B in the main text) are calculated from the sample of N transmission trees by averaging the distances and times from each infector to their VL infectees within each tree, and then averaging these quantities over all the trees in which that VL/PKDL case is an infector:
where · 
[33]
The absolute contribution of each infectious state to the e ective reproduction number at time t is:
where X oe {A, I} denotes the infectious state, and, as described above, in the main text we split the numbers of secondary 517 infections (Rj) arising from VL and PKDL for cases that had both.
To assess the fit of the model and simulate hypothetical interventions against PKDL, we create a stochastic simulation version of 520 the individual-level spatiotemporal transmission model described above. We follow standard stochastic simulation methodology 521 for discrete-time individual-level transmission models (47), converting infection event rates into probabilities in order to 522 determine who gets infected in each month. We assume that an individual's progression through di erent infection states 523 following infection occurs independently of the rest of the epidemic (i.e. is either governed by internal biological processes or 524 random external processes of detection), which enables the simulation of an individual's full infection history from the point of 525 infection.
So that we can simulate durations of PKDL infectiousness, we fit a negative binomial distribution NB(r5, p5) to the observed 527 PKDL onset-to-treatment times and onset-to-resolution times for self-resolving PKDL cases in the data: 
Given these pieces of information, the simulation algorithm proceeds as follows: negative binomially distributed (48). The PMF of a size-biased negative binomial random variable X ú corresponding to 542 X ≥ NB is: and assign a PKDL infectious by drawing from Cat({h1, h2, h3, hu}, p) . 562 ii. Else the individual recovers without developing PKDL, so draw a recovery time: Figure   575 S5 and Table S4 respectively. Based on the deviance distributions and DIC values, the best-fitting model is the model with 576 additional within-household transmission and the highest level of relative pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectiousness 577 (both 2% as infectious as VL). Hence, we focus on the output of this model in the main text and below. and "") and incubation period distribution parameter p for the di erent models are shown in Table S4 . The parameter estimates 580 are very similar across the di erent models and vary in the way expected -the spatial transmission rate constantand 581 background transmission rate ' are lower for models with additional within-household transmission ("" > 0) and decrease with 582 increasing relative asymptomatic infectiousness h4, and the mode foris slightly larger for models with "" > 0 (since a flatter 583 kernel shape compensates for the extra within-household transmission). The posterior distributions for the incubation period 584 distribution parameter p correspond to a mean incubation period of 5.7-6.9 months (95% HPDIs (4.8,6.6)-(6.0,7.8) months). The log-likelihood trace and posterior distributions for the parameters for the best-fitting model are shown in Figure S6 .
The parameters are clearly well defined by the data, as the posterior distributions di er significantly from the weak prior 587 distributions.
The corresponding autocorrelation plots are shown in Figure S7 . The high degree of autocorrelation evident for all the 589 parameters is due to strong correlation between the transmission parameters and the missing data, in particular between the 590 spatial transmission rate constantand the asymptomatic infection times. Figure S8 shows thatis strongly negatively 591 correlated with the mean asymptomatic infection timeĀ. This is expected since a higher overall transmission rate leads to show that there is some negative correlation betweenand ', -and ', and "" and p. These correlations are not surprising: the 603 more transmission that is explained by proximity to infectious individuals (the higher -), the less needs to be explained by the 604 background transmission (the lower '); the flatter the spatial kernel (the larger -), the fewer infections need to be explained by 605 the background transmission; and the more infections are accounted for by transmission within the same household (the higher 606 ""), the longer the incubation period (the lower p) needs to be (due to long times between onsets of cases in the same household).
The acceptance rate for the transmission parameter updates (Step 1 in the MCMC algorithm) was 23. demonstrate that the data augmentation algorithm works as expected. Figure S10 shows the incidence curve of VL and PKDL 615 cases for the whole study area and the inferred incidence curve of asymptomatic infections (averaged over the MCMC chain).
The number of asymptomatic infections increases and decreases with the number of VL cases as expected given the assumption 617 that the incidence ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infection is fixed.
The posterior probabilities that individuals were asymptomatically infected during the study (shown in Figure S11 , with is higher). This is as expected given the structure of the model (the decrease in the risk of infection with distance from an 622 infectious individual encoded in the spatial kernel) and the estimates of the transmission parameters. The examples shown in Figure S12 demonstrate that non-symptomatic individuals' asymptomatic ""infection"" time posterior distributions (red). Note that asymptomatic ""infection"" in months 0 and T + 1 = 109, represent asymptomatic infection before the study and no asymptomatic infection before the end of the study, respectively. (A) Individual who migrated into a house with an active VL case from outside the study area in month 53 and therefore had a high initial probability of asymptomatic infection, followed by further peaks in asymptomatic infection risk in months 64 and 69 with the PKDL and VL onsets of two other household members in months 63 and 68 respectively.

1dd898b5ca1ae70ec0e3cad89fc87a165002a99e,"In 2013, U.S. swine producers were confronted with the disruptive emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread.

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), the causative agent, acutely infects the intestine and causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting. 2 Currently, the earliest known U.S. outbreak occurred in April, 3 and in less than a year PED outbreaks were confirmed in 27 states, 4 states that unweaned pigs. 3 The time it takes for a farm to return to stable production is highly variable but on the order of weeks, leading to great expenses in infection control costs and production losses alike.
Losses were also apparent on a national economic scale. Producers had for the previous 8 years been making steady increases in the average litter size of about 0.16 head per year. 6 By November 2013, the average litter size had begun an abnormal downturn, 6 dropping 0.66 head by March 2014. 7 The virus also affected swine production in Asia and other parts of America. 8, 9 The mechanisms by which PEDV spread among farms are not yet clear. Transportation-associated transmission of PEDV has been supported by the observation at harvest facilities that it spreads among trailers used to transport swine, 10 and some experts believe that current resources of livestock trailers, trailer-washing facilities, and transport personnel are insufficient to allow for a standard 3-hour trailer cleaning between every load. 11 With such concerns in mind, some states responded to PED by requiring that imported swine be from PEDV-free premises. Transportation-independent mechanisms such as airborne particles 12 and contaminated feed [13] [14] [15] [16] have also been implicated. Detailed investigations of outbreaks on farms can be inconclusive regarding the mechanism of PEDV introduction. 3 Much of the research on PED involves detailed investigations on a small scale. For example, there have been epidemiological investigations of infected farms in North Carolina and a cluster of infected farms in Oklahoma and adjacent states. 17 Such work is effective for determining the biological plausibility of different routes, but the risk factors identified in a small-scale study may be specific to the small area of the study. Modelling studies based on large-scale surveillance data [18] [19] [20] can thus be a valuable complement to such work by quantifying the overall importance of a transmission route across a large population.
Such quantification for PED could also be considered a contribution to the general study of infectious diseases of livestock.
Although animal movements in general are considered a risk for transmission, 21 only a limited number of studies 18-20, 22, 23 have quantitatively compared this risk to other competing risks. One likely reason for this scarcity is that statistical analysis of the available data often presents many challenges such as incomplete and noisy reporting as well as correlations in explanatory variables.
Here we first evaluate the sensitivity of a correlation analysis to transmission and contact parameters of a simulation model of PED spread among U.S. swine farms via spatial and transport-associated pathways. The model includes an error-prone observational component designed to mimic that of the real data. We then apply this correlation analyis to the real data. We follow up on this analyis by considering a larger group of explanatory variables and applying stability selection to identify those with the most robust association with PED burdens. Using the selected variables, we formulate a simple model of farm-to-farm spread and estimate transmission parameters.
We first provide a brief background on the natural history PED outbreaks to make clear the features that our models replicate and those that they do not. The time from the introduction of infected animals to the appearance of clinical symptoms in PEDV-naive herds is typically less than 7 days. 9, 24 PED may spread rapidly within farms following the first appearance of clinical signs . 9, 16, [25] [26] [27] The spread may also be actively promoted as a part of recommended feedback procedures to establish herd immunity. 24 The duration of an outbreak can vary substantially. The lower bound would be roughly a week, as virus shedding from individuals has been observed in experimental settings to subside within 9 days of infection, 28 and an infected animal's diarrhoea has been observed in the field to typically last for 5 days. 25 However, it can take affected farms several weeks to return to baseline production levels. 9, 25 In summary, within a farm spread is often rapid and complete enough that assuming all animals on the farm to have the same status is justified when observation occurs at weekly intervals.
When we step back from a single farm and consider all the farms in the United States, a number of heterogeneities enter the picture. All of the contiguous 48 states share some portion of the nation's swine but the Midwest and North Carolina are areas of major concentration ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), holding some 88 percent of the inventory. 5 Thus considerable climactic and density gradients exist. Live swine are moved among farms for feeding and breeding purposes. We refer to aggregated measurements of these movements as transport flows. The value of these flows varies greatly between different pairs of states with the largest flows being into the Midwest (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). These heterogeneities may result in the spread of a disease resulting in a spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks that is dependent on the mode of farm-to-farm spread, and for PED data on both the spatio-temporal pattern and the heterogeneities are available at the state level.
The data we analysed were obtained from public sources. The data on numbers of farms, balance sheets, and climatic regions came from regular USDA reports. The data on transport flows came from a study by the USDA Economic Research Service. 29 The PED outbreak data were derived from a report published on the website of the American Association of Swine Veterinarians.
A detailed description of these data may be found in the Supplementary Note. We next discuss an important assumption made about the PED outbreak data here. 
Since the data were highly aggregated and noisy, it was instructive for us to evaluate the performance of our correlation analysis under these conditions. To that end, we simulated the spread of a disease among individual U.S. swine farms, simulated a series of positive accessions, and then performed the correlation analysis on the simulated accession data. The model of disease spread included contact networks based on the spatial and transport structure of U.S. farms. The correlation analysis estimated the strength of association between the similarity of the time series of accessions between a pair of states with the measure of similarity according to either spatial or transport structure. Using previously described methods, 31, 32 we computed global sensitivity indices up to second order for the mean value of these correlations for the parameter space given in Table 1 . These indices estimate the fraction of the variance in the correlation that is due to variation in individual parameters or pairs of parameters. This exercise did not validate our modeling assumptions, but rather evaluated self-consistency by showing the extent to which we could quantify and distinguish between different modes of spread given our assumed models of spread and observation. The procedure is described in further detail in the Supplementary Note.
To see if important variables were missing from our correlation analysis, we performed variable selection for a regression model of the cumulative number of outbreaks in each state. Candidate predictors were chosen based on availability and expected effects on either reporting rates or risk. In addition to transport-associated risk, we considered that the risk of an outbreak may depend on climate, the density of farms in an area, and on a farm's distance to other outbreaks. Table 2 contains a brief description of all the predictors considered and the Supplementary Note contains a detailed description.
Most of our predictors were correlated with other predictors as well as with the total positive accessions in each state. For such data, fitting regression models with an elastic net penalty allows groups of correlated variables to be given similar effect sizes whereas other modelling approaches, such as stepwise approaches and the use of a lasso penalty, may lead to one variable in a correlated group being singled out and being given a too-large effect size. 33 In general for elastic net regression, the weight given to the penalty determines whether any variable is selected. Often, the goal of a regression analysis is to obtain a model with good predictive performance and the weight is chosen by cross validation. 33 By contrast, we have no need of a predictive model and are instead more interested in determining what variables are important to include in a model. Stability selection 34 provides a general method of identifying relevant variables. The main idea is to select variables that across many random subsamples of the data are selected with high probability by the elastic net with a given set of weights for the penalty. We use this procedure because it is less likely to select noise variables than is cross validation. 34 Further details are given in the Supplementary Note.

To estimate how farm density and transport flows may affect transmission rates, we fit the parameters c i and η in the following regression model
where We fitted these models to data from all 48 contiguous states with the assumption that the observed positive accessions I i,t+1 have a negative binomial distribution with an unknown, but constant, dispersion parameter which we denote with θ .
This parameter is related to the variance by Var(
We assumed that the random effect Z i is normally distributed. Then the likelihood is fully specified. We calculated marginal likelihoods with the Laplace approximation and numerically found the parameters that maximised it. In some cases we fixed η to 0.5, which allowed the model to be fully fit with both the lme4 35 and glmmADMB 36 packages in R. 37 To make sure our results were not sensitive to η = 0.5, we used R's optimise function to find the value of η in [0, 5] with highest likelihood. We performed several diagnostic checks of our fits, including checking for signs of nonlinearity with partial residual plots and for signs of temporal autocorrelation in the residuals.
We also verified that the flows term is significant in models lacking random effects, and after excluding any data points with dfbetas 38 above 0.2.
Before we present the correlation analysis on the empirical PED data, we first consider the sensitivity of the correlations to the parameters of a model of disease spread among farms in the U.S. swine herd. A large portion of the variance in our simulation output was stochastic. The value of 1 − R 2 for our mean metamodel was 0.53, 0.46, and 0.18 respectively for correlations

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/017178 doi: bioRxiv preprint between the lag-1 cross correlation matrix and the distance, shared border, and transport flow matrices. Figure 2 shows that parameters with the highest sensitivities were the transmission probability for transport edges, the amplitude of seasonal variation in transmission probabilities, and the resolution of the raster grid used to generate spatial edges. All correlation types typically increased with transmission probabilities across transport edges, with those of the transport flow matrix increasing the most (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). All correlation types typically increased as spatial resolution decreased and the spatial contact network became more dense (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Sensitivity to the spatial transmission probability was noticeable only on the more dense spatial network (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Seasonal variation in the transmission probabilities tended to reduce correlations (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4 ). Correlation size was indicative of statistical significance ( Supplementary   Figs. S3-S5 ). In summary, the largest sensitivities were to transmission and contact parameters, and these parameters had unsurprising relationships with the matrix correlations.
To provide insight into the relative importance of spatial and transport-associated transmission for PED, we applied the correlation analysis to data from the 2013 epizootic. We found that lag-1 cross correlations of positive accessions were positively correlated with the logarithm of transport flows. This relation held whether flows and cross correlations were treated as directional (Fig. 3a) , were averaged over both directions ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ), or were ranked ( Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). The size of the correlation was comparable to those seen in our simulations for high transmission probabilities across network edges (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The p values for these correlations were all below 0.05 / 6, which means that they would remain significant after using a Bonferroni method of limiting the probability that any false positives occurred in our tests to 0.05. On the other hand, in no case would the correlations between geographic distance and cross correlations remain significant after such a correction. The correlations between the cross correlation matrix and the shared border matrix were similar to or weaker than those of the distance matrix, were not significant after Bonferroni correction, and were not included in the plots to keep them simpler. Analogous results hold for lag-0 and lag-2 cross correlations. Although higher lags are potentially informative, we did not attempt to analyse them as they were typically smaller, had more skewed distributions, and had greater uncertainty.
The flows were themselves correlated with the distance between state centres, and these distances were in turn correlated with cross correlations (Fig. 3a) . Thus we also calculated the partial correlation of flows and cross correlations, controlling for distance. This partial correlation was around 0.31 whether directed or undirected relationships were used, and thus controlling for distance does not greatly diminish the correlation.
The Mantel test found a significant correlation between transport flows and cross correlations but did not account for many potential confounding variables. To address that limitation, we performed variable selection on a panel of candidate variables to identify those with the most robust associations with cumulative burdens of PED. Using stability selection with data from 42

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/017178 doi: bioRxiv preprint observations, we found that among all variables in Table 2 the number of farms in a state was the only variable selected as a predictor of whether it reported any positive accessions. Among the 22 states reporting positive accessions, swine inventory and marketings were selected as predictors of the total number of positive accessions. Marketings is the total number of swine shipped out of a state or slaughtered.
To obtain a rough estimate of the effect of flows on transmission rates that accounted for other effects such as seasonality and farm density, we fitted the case data to time series susceptible-infected-recovered models. Figure 4 displays the predicted and observed marginal relationships between flows and positive accessions for one of the models. Although our flow variables were based on the outcome of variable selection, they are not equivalent to any of the variables in the variable selection procedure and the data analysed here has a time dimension not present in the data used for variable selection. Thus to confirm the statistical significance of the within-state flows, we conducted a likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that models lacking terms for within-state flow were sufficient. The test favoured rejection of models without within-state flows (χ 2 1 = 12.9, p = 1.6 × 10 −4 ).
Among those models containing flows, undirected models, which assumed that flows increased contact rates in both source and destination states, fit best, and directed models, which assumed that flows increased contact of susceptible farms in the destination state to infective farms in the origin state, fit worst (Table 3) . However, the parameter estimates were generally similar for all of these models, with flows having an appreciable effect (Fig. 5 ).
Our first main finding is that our correlation analysis method may for a range of parameter values remain sensitive to transmission and contact parameters of interest in spite of receiving partial, biased, and noisy data about the state of simulated epizootics as input. In short, the signals generated by the heterogeneity in the structure of the swine herd were not drowned out by the substantial noise generated by the observation model. The potential of herd structure to strongly influence the dynamics of swine diseases has been noted in previous work, 39 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/017178 doi: bioRxiv preprint opinion to set them. 41, 42 Estimates such as ours may thus be key for determining what parameter values are consistent with past epizootics.
What features of the time series might have driven the results in our correlation analysis? The correlation between transport and cross correlations seemed to be driven in part by concentration of both high cross correlations and large flows in Midwestern states ( Supplementary Fig. S1) . The cross correlations of these states results from the presence of a small wave of positive accessions early in the outbreak and a much larger wave toward the end of our observations (Fig. 3b, left column) . Also, Kansas and Oklahoma share a distinctive period of high positive accessions in the middle of the time series and fairly large flows (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Fig. 3b) . Epidemiological reports suggest that windborne transmission was important for spread in Oklahoma, and thus the summer activity in Kansas and Oklahoma may also have been a consequence of short-distance, spatial spread. It is not known how the spread in these states occurred in spite of the high temperatures that were thought to have slowed PEDV transmission in other states during the summer. North Carolina is distinct from the Midwest in that no outbreaks occurred in the spring and many outbreaks occurred in October (Fig. 3b) . Epidemiological reports suggest that PEDV was introduced in the Midwest and eventually reached North Carolina via transport. The high number of sow farms in the state may have allowed for a largely self-sustained cluster of outbreaks following introduction. Although the matrices measuring spatial transmission may not have come out as significant in our analysis, consideration of the epidemiological explanations for the time series suggests that spatial transmission may to some extent explain the significance of the transport flow matrix.
Both epidemiological and statistical mechanisms may explain why the undirected model fit best (Table 3 ) and why pairaveraged flows had higher correlations than directed flows (e.g., Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6) . A possible epidemiological mechanism is that trucks arriving to pick up loads are introducing the virus to farms. A possible statistical mechanism was seen in our simulations. We noticed that even though transport contact was based on directed transport flows, symmetrised matrices had slightly higher correlations than asymmetric matrices.
Our analyses were likely limited in power by inaccuracies in our variables measuring population structure. For example, the transport flows used excluded transport to harvest plants, and such movements have been observed 10 to result in the contamination of trailers. Another concern is the coarseness and age of the flow estimates. In support of them being sufficiently informative, previous phylogeographic analysis 43 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/017178 doi: bioRxiv preprint farms tend to specialise on specific production stages. But if larger farms did not experience more PED outbreaks but only reported them with higher probability, that could provide a false signal that flows are associated with risk. A phylogeographic analysis or analysis of suitably structured epidemiological data could establish an association between flows and spread of PEDV that is not subject to such confounding.
Both the objectives, identifying variables relevant to the risk of infection, and challenges of our data analysis, uncertain reporting rates and many correlated candidate predictors, are common in epidemiological studies. Two reasonable steps toward such an objective are to assemble as many relevant explanatory variables as possible about reporting rates and measures of exposure based on prior scientific knowledge and then to determine if the available data support the conclusion that these variables are relevant. Our general contribution has been to provide a worked-out example of how variation in the structure of the population across a large scale may allow for the identification of variables with relevance to mechanisms of spread. We have also demonstrated the use of stability selection and regularised regression for the task of filtering out noise variables from a set of candidates. These examples may serve to provide analysts with new ideas about how to make the most efficient use of often limited epidemiological data, hopefully leading to more rapid understanding of transmission and how to stop it. Table 3 . Summary of models. The models chiefly differ by how contact is assumed to depend on flows. In the null model, denoted by none, contact was independent of flows. In the internal model, contact was a function of within-state flows. In the directed model, contact was a function of flows moving into a state and within-state flows. In the undirected model, contact was a function of within-state flows and both flows into and out of a state. The column ""Fit η?"" indicates whether we estimated the value of η, which corresponds to risk that is independent of the number of infective farms. The symbol θ denotes the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial response. The symbol σ denotes the standard deviation of the random effect of (geographic) state on transmission rates. To display their density, they have been made transparent and jittered along the y axis. The y axis was transformed using y = log(Positive accessions + 1).
